[Brackets] enclose editorial explanations. Small ·dots· enclose material that has been added, but can be read as
though it were part of the original text. Occasional •bullets, and also indenting of passages that are not quotations,

are meant as aids to grasping the structure of a sentence or a thought. Every four-point ellipsis . . . . indicates the
omission of a brief passage that seems to present more difficulty than it is worth. Longer omissions are reported

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

Glossary
agreement: The item that Rousseau calls a convention is
an event, whereas what we call ‘conventions’ (setting aside
the irrelevant ‘convention’ = ‘professional get-together’) are
not events but enduring states of affairs like the conventions
governing the meanings of words, the standards of politeness,
etc. So ‘convention’ is a wrong translation; and ‘agreement’
is right.
alienate: To alienate something that you own is to bring it
about that you no longer own it; in brief, to give it away or
sell it,
arbitrary: It means ‘brought into existence by the decision
of some person(s)’. It’s no part of the meaning here (as it is
today) that the decision was frivolous or groundless.
censorship: This translates Rousseau’s censure. It doesn’t
refer to censorship as we know it today; censure didn’t have
that meaning until the 19th century. Rousseau’s topic is a
role that certain officials had in some periods of the Roman
republic, namely as guardians of, and spokesmen for, the
people’s mœurs (see below). They could be thought of as an
institutionalising of the ‘court of public opinion’. On page 67
we see him stretching the original sense.
compact, contract: These translate Rousseau’s pacte and
contrat respectively. He seems to mean them as synonyms.
constitution: In this work a thing’s ‘constitution’ is the
sum of facts about how something is constituted, how its
parts hang together and work together (so the constitution
of a state is nothing like a document). Items credited
with ‘constitutions’ are organisms and political entities; the
mention on page 66 of the constitution of a people seems
aberrant.

magistrate: In this work, as in general in early modern
times, a ‘magistrate’ is anyone with an official role in government. The magistracy is the set of all such officials, thought
of as a single body.
mœurs: The mœurs of a people include their morality, their
basic customs, their attitudes and expectations about how
people will behave, their ideas about what is decent. . . and so
on. This word—rhyming approximately with ‘worse’—is left
untranslated because there’s no good English equivalent to
it. English speakers sometimes use it, for the sort of reason
they have for sometimes using Schadenfreude.
moral person: Something that isn’t literally person but is
being regarded as one for some theoretical purpose. See for
example pages 9 and 36.
populace: Rousseau repeatedly speaks of a ‘people’ in the
singular, and we can do that in English (‘The English—what a
strange people!’); but it many cases this way of using ‘people’
sounds strained and peculiar, and this version takes refuge
in ‘populace’. On page 4, for instance, that saves us from ‘In
every generation the people was the master. . . ’.
prince: As was common in his day, Rousseau uses ‘prince’
to stand for the chief of the government. This needn’t be a
person with the rank of Prince; it needn’t be a person at all,
because it could be a committee.
sovereign: This translates souverain. As Rousseau makes
clear on page 7, he uses this term as a label for the person
or group of persons holding supreme power in a state. In
a democracy, the whole people constitute a sovereign, and
individual citizens are members of the sovereign. In Books 3

and 4 ‘sovereign’ is used for the legislator (or legislature) as
distinct from the government = the executive.

able’, rather more strongly than whatever it is that you and I
mean by ‘wise’.

The first societies

BOOK 1
This little treatise is salvaged from a much longer work that I abandoned long ago, having started it without thinking about
whether I was capable of pulling it off. Of various bits that might be rescued from what I had written of that longer work, what I
offer here is the most substantial and, it seems to me, the least unworthy of being published. None of the rest of it is.
I plan to address this question: With men as they are and
with laws as they could be, can there be in the civil order
any sure and legitimate rule of administration? In tackling
this I shall try always to unite •what right allows with •what
interest demands, so that •justice and •utility don’t at any
stage part company.
I start on this without showing that the subject is important. You may want to challenge me: ‘So you want to write on
politics—are you then a prince [see Glossary] or a legislator?’ I
answer that I am neither, and that is why I write on politics.
If I were a prince or a legislator I wouldn’t waste my time
saying what should be done; I would do it, or keep quiet.
As I was born a citizen of a free state, and am a member
of its sovereign [see Glossary], my right to vote makes it my
duty to study public affairs, however little influence my voice
can have on them. Happily, when I think about governments
I always find that my inquiries give me new reasons for loving
the government of my own country!

If I took into account nothing but force and what can be
done by force, I would say:
‘As long as a people is constrained to obey, it does
well to obey; as soon as it can shake off the yoke, it
does even better to shake it off. ·If its right to do so is
challenged, it can answer that·: it gets its liberty back
by the same ‘right’—·namely, force·—that took it away
in the first place. Any justification for taking it away
equally justifies taking it back; and if there was no
justification for its being taken away ·no justification
for taking it back is called for·.’
But the social order ·isn’t to be understood in terms of force;
it· is a sacred right on which all other rights are based. But it
doesn’t come from nature, so it must be based on agreements.
Before coming to that, though, I have to establish the truth
of what I have been saying.

1. The subject of the first book

The most ancient of all societies, and the only natural one,
is the society of the family. Yet the children remain attached
to the father only for as long as they need him for their
preservation; as soon as this need ceases, the natural bond
is dissolved. The children, released from the obedience they
owed to the father, and the father, released from the care he
owed his children, return equally to independence. If they
remain united, this is something they do not •naturally but

2. The first societies

Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains. Here’s
one who thinks he is the master of others, yet he is more
enslaved than they are. How did this change come about? I
don’t know. What can make it legitimate? That’s a question
that I think I can answer.

The right of the strongest

•voluntarily, and the family itself is then maintained only by

agreement.
This common liberty is an upshot of the nature of man.
His first law is to provide for his own preservation, his first
cares are those he owes to himself; and as soon as he can
think for himself he is the sole judge of the right way to take
care of himself, which makes him his own master.
You could call the family the prime model of political
societies: the ruler corresponds to the father, and the people
to the children; and all of them—·ruler, people, father,
children·—because they were born free and equal don’t give
up their liberty without getting something in return. The
whole difference is that •in the family the father’s care for
his children is repaid by his love for them, whereas •in the
state the ruler’s care for the people under him is repaid not
by love for them (which he doesn’t have!) but by the pleasure
of being in charge.
Grotius denies that all human power is established in
favour of the governed, and cites slavery as a counterexample.
His usual method of reasoning is to establish •right by
•fact [meaning: . . . ‘to draw conclusions about what should be the case
from premises about what is the case’]. Not the most logical of
argument-patterns, but it’s one that is very favourable to
tyrants.
. . . .Throughout his book, Grotius seems to favour—as
does Hobbes—the thesis that the human species is divided
into so many herds of cattle, each with a ruler who keeps
guard over them for the purpose of devouring them.
Philo tells us that the Emperor Caligula reasoned thus:
As a shepherd has a higher nature than his flock does,
so also the shepherds of men, i.e. their rulers, have a
higher nature than do the peoples under them;
from which he inferred, reasonably enough, that either kings
were gods or men were beasts.

This reasoning of Caligula’s is on a par with that of
Hobbes and Grotius. Aristotle, before any of them, had
said that men are not naturally equal because some are born
for slavery and others for command.
Aristotle was right; but he mistook the effect for the cause.
Every man born in slavery is born for slavery—nothing is
more certain than that. Slaves lose everything in their chains,
even the desire to escape from them: they love their servitude,
as Ulysses’ comrades loved their brutish condition ·when the
goddess Circe turned them into pigs·. So if there are slaves
by nature, that’s because there have been slaves against
nature. Force made the first slaves, and their cowardice kept
them as slaves.
I have said nothing about King Adam; or about Emperor
Noah, the father of three great monarchs who shared out
the universe (like Saturn’s children, whom some scholars
have recognised in them). [In Genesis 9 it is said that after the
flood Noah’s three sons ruled the world.] I hope to be given credit
for my moderation: as a direct descendant of one of these
princes—perhaps of the eldest branch—I don’t know that a
verification of titles wouldn’t show me to be the legitimate
king of the human race! Anyway, Adam was undeniably
sovereign of the world, as Robinson Crusoe was of his island,
as long as he was its only inhabitant; and this empire had
the advantage that the monarch, safe on his throne, had
nothing to fear from rebellions, wars, or conspirators.

3. The right of the strongest
The strongest is never strong enough to be always the master
unless he transforms •strength into •right, and •obedience
into •duty. Hence ‘the right of the strongest’—a phrase that
one might think is meant ironically, but is actually laid down
2

Slavery

4. Slavery

as a basic truth. But will no-one ever explain this phrase?
Force is a physical power; I don’t see what moral effect it
can have. Giving way to force is something you have to do,
not something you choose to do; ·or if you insist that choice
comes into it·, it is at most an act of •prudence. In what
sense can it be a •duty?

Since no man has a •natural authority over his fellow, and
•force creates no right, we are left with •agreements [see
Glossary] as the basis for all legitimate authority among men.
Grotius says:
If an individual can alienate [see Glossary] his liberty
and make himself the slave of a master, why couldn’t
a whole people alienate its liberty and make itself
subject to a king?
This contains several ambiguous words that need to be
explained, but let us confine ourselves to ‘alienate’. To
alienate something is to give or sell it. Now, a man who
becomes the slave of another does not give himself—he
sells himself at the rock-bottom price of his subsistence [see
Glossary]. But when a people sells itself what price is paid?
·Not their subsistence:· Far from providing his subjects with
their subsistence, a king gets his own subsistence only from
them. . . . Do subjects then give their persons on condition
that the king takes their goods also? I fail to see what they
have left to preserve.
‘The despot guarantees civic peace in the state’, you may
say. Granted; but what do the people gain if
•the wars his ambition brings down on them,
•his insatiable greed, and
•harassments by his ministers
bring them more misery than they’d have suffered from their
own dissensions ·if no monarchy had been established·?
What do they gain if this peace is one of their miseries? You
can live peacefully in a dungeon, but does that make it a
good life? The Greeks imprisoned in the cave of the Cyclops
lived there peacefully while waiting for their turn to be eaten.
To say that a man gives himself ·to someone else, i.e.
hands himself over· free, is to say something absurd and

Suppose for a moment that this so-called ‘right ·of the
strongest·’ exists. I maintain that we’ll get out of this
nothing but a mass of inexplicable nonsense. If force makes
right, then if you change the force you change the right
(effects change when causes change!), so that when one force
overcomes another, there’s a corresponding change in what
is right. The moment it becomes possible to disobey •with
impunity it becomes possible to disobey •legitimately. And
because the strongest are always in the right, the only thing
that matters is to work to become the strongest. Now, what
sort of right is it that perishes when force fails? If force
makes us obey, we can’t be morally obliged to obey; and
if force doesn’t make us obey, then ·on the theory we are
examining· we are under no obligation to do so. Clearly, the
word ‘right’ adds nothing to force: in this context it doesn’t
stand for anything.
‘Obey the powers that be.’ If this means submit to force,
it is a good precept, but superfluous: I guarantee that it will
never be violated! All power comes from God, I admit; but
so does all sickness—are we then forbidden to send for the
doctor? A robber confronts me at the edge of a wood: I am
compelled to hand over my money, but is it the case that
even if I could hold onto it I am morally obliged to hand it
over? After all, the pistol he holds is also a power.
Then let us agree that force doesn’t create right, and that
legitimate powers are the only ones we are obliged to obey.
Which brings us back to my original question.
3

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

inconceivable; such an act is null and illegitimate, simply
because the man who does it is out of his mind. To say the
same of a whole people is to suppose a people of madmen;
and madness doesn’t create any right.

Slavery

mine; and it doesn’t make sense to speak of my right against
myself.
Grotius and company cite war as another source for the
so-called right of slavery. The winner having (they say) the
right to kill the loser, the latter can buy back his life at the
price of his freedom; and this agreement is all the more
legitimate in being to the advantage of both parties.

Even if each man could alienate himself, he couldn’t
alienate his children: they are born men, and born free;
their liberty belongs to them, and no-one else has the
right to dispose of it. While they are too young to decide
for themselves, their father can, in their name, lay down
conditions for their preservation and well-being; but he can’t
make an irrevocable and unconditional gift of them; such
a gift is contrary to the ends of nature, and exceeds the
rights of paternity. So an arbitrary [see Glossary] government
couldn’t be legitimate unless in every generation the populace
[see Glossary] was the master who was in a position to accept
or reject it; but then the government would no longer be
arbitrary!

But this supposed right to kill the loser is clearly not
an upshot of the state of war. Men are not naturally one
anothers’ enemies. [The next sentence is expanded in ways that the
·small dots· convention can’t easily handle.] Any natural relations
amongst them must exist when they are living in their
primitive independence without any government or social
structure; but at that time they have no inter-relations that
are stable enough to constitute either the state of peace or
the state of war. War is constituted by a relation between
things, not between persons; and because the state of war
can’t arise out of simple personal relations but only out
of thing-relations, there can’t be a private war (a war of
man against man) in the state of nature, where there is no
ownership, or in the state of society, where everything is
under the authority of the laws.

To renounce your liberty is to renounce •your status as a
man, •your rights as a human being, and even •your duties
as a human being. There can’t be any way of compensating
someone who gives up everything. Such a renunciation
is incompatible with man’s nature; to remove all freedom
from his will is to remove all morality from his actions.
Finally, an ‘agreement’ to have absolute authority on one
side and unlimited obedience on the other—what an empty
and contradictory agreement that would have to be! Isn’t it
clear that if we are entitled to take anything and everything
from a person, we can’t be under any obligation to him? And
isn’t that fact alone—the fact that there is no equivalence,
nothing to be exchanged, between the two sides—enough
to nullify the ‘agreement’? What right can my slave have
against me? Everything that he has is mine; his right is

Individual combats, duels and encounters are acts that
can’t constitute a state. As for the private wars that were
authorised by Louis IX of France. . . ., they were abuses of
feudal government, which was itself an absurd system if ever
there was one—contrary to the principles of natural right
and to all good government.
So war is a relation not between man and man but
between state and state, and individuals are enemies only accidentally, not as •men nor even as •citizens but as •soldiers;
not as belonging to their country but as defenders of it.1 And

The Romans, who understood and respected the right of war more than any other nation on earth were so scrupulous about this that a citizen wasn’t

the only enemies a state can have are other states; not men,
because there can’t be a real settled relation between things
as radically different as states and men.

Slavery

kill an enemy except when he can’t make him a slave, so the
right to enslave him can’t be derived from the right to kill
him: it’s not fair dealing to make him spend his freedom so
as to keep his life, over which the victor holds no right. Isn’t
it clear that there’s a vicious circle in basing the right of life
and death on the right of slavery, and the right of slavery on
the right of life and death?
Even if we assume this terrible right to kill everybody, I
maintain that someone enslaved in war isn’t committed to
do anything for his master except what he is compelled to do;
and the same goes for a conquered people. [Rousseau’s point

This principle squares with the established rules of all
times and the constant practice of all civilised peoples.
Declarations of war don’t give notice to •powers as much
as to •their subjects. A foreigner—whether king, individual,
or whole people—who robs, kills or detains the subjects ·of
a country· without first declaring war on their prince is not
an enemy but a bandit. When a full-scale war is going on, a
prince is entitled to help himself to anything in the enemy
country that belongs to the public, but if he is just he will
respect the lives and goods of individuals—he will respect
rights on which his own are based. The purpose of the war
is to destroy the enemy state, so we [see Glossary] have a right
to kill its defenders while they are bearing arms; but as soon
as they lay down their weapons and surrender, they stop
being enemies or instruments of the enemy and resume their
status as simply men, and no-one has any right to take their
lives. Sometimes it is possible to kill a state without killing
any of its members; and a war doesn’t give any right that
isn’t needed for the war to gain its objective. These principles
are not those of Grotius: they aren’t based on the authority
of poets, but are derived from the nature of things and are
based on reason.

here is that the enslaved individual or the conquered people doesn’t owe

By taking an equivalent for his life,
the winner hasn’t done him a favour; instead of killing him
without profit, he has killed him usefully. He is indeed so
far from getting any •authority over the slave in addition to
his •power over him, that the two are still in a state of war
towards one another: their master/slave relation comes from
that, and this enforcement of a right of war doesn’t imply
that there has been a peace-treaty! They have reached an
agreement; but this agreement, far from ending the state of
war, presupposes its continuance.
Whatever angle we look at it from, therefore, the ‘right
of slavery’ is null and void—not only as illegitimate but also
as absurd and meaningless. The words ‘slave’ and ‘right’
contradict each other, and are mutually exclusive. It will
always be crazy to say to a man, or to a people: ‘I make an
agreement with you wholly at your expense and wholly to
my advantage; I shall keep it as long as I like, and you will
keep it as long as I like.’
the conqueror anything.]

What about the ‘right of conquest’? The only basis for
that is ‘the law of the strongest’! If war doesn’t give the
winner the right to massacre the conquered peoples, you
can’t cite that right—a ‘right’ that doesn’t exist—as a basis
for a right to enslave those peoples. No-one has a right to

allowed to serve as a volunteer without explicitly agreeing to serve against such-and-such a named enemy. [Rousseau throws in an anecdote about
a soldier whose military oath had to be renewed because etc. He continues:] I know that the siege of Clusium and other isolated events can be cited
against me; but I’m talking ·not about individual episodes, but· about laws and customs. The Romans obeyed their laws more than any other people,
and they had better laws than any other people.

1 6.

The social compact

6. The social compact
Let us take it that men have reached the point at which the
obstacles to their survival in the state of nature overpower
each individual’s resources for maintaining himself in that
state. So this primitive condition can’t go on; the human
race will perish unless it changes its manner of existence.
Now, men can’t create new forces; they can only •bring
together ones that already exist, and •steer them. So their
only way to preserve themselves is to unite a number of
forces so that they are jointly powerful enough to deal with
the obstacles. They have to bring these forces into play in
such a way that they act together in a single thrust.
For forces to add up in this way, many people have to
work together. But each man’s force and liberty are what he
chiefly needs for his own survival; so how can he put them
into this collective effort without harming his own interests
and neglecting the care he owes to himself? This difficulty,
in the version of it that arises for my present subject, can be
put like this:
Find a form of association that will bring the whole
common force to bear on defending and protecting
each associate’s person and goods, doing this in such
a way that each of them, while uniting himself with
all, still obeys only himself and remains as free as
before.’
There’s the basic problem that is solved by the social contract.

[For ‘agreement’ see Glossary.] Even if I granted everything that I

have refuted up to here, the supporters of despotism would
be no better off. Ruling a society will always be a quite
different thing from subduing a multitude. If any number of
scattered individuals were successively enslaved by one man,
all I can see there is a master and his slaves, and certainly
not a people and its ruler. It’s a •cluster, if you will, but
not an •association; there’s no public good there, and no
body politic. This man may have enslaved half the world
but he is still only an individual; his interest, apart from
that of others, is never anything but a purely private interest.
When this man dies, the empire he leaves behind him will
remains scattered and without unity, like an oak that falls
into a fire and dissolves into a heap of ashes when the fire
has consumed it.
A people, says Grotius, can give itself to a king; so he
must hold that a people is a people before it gives itself to a
king. This gift is itself a civic act, which has to arise from
public deliberation. Before we examine (2) the act by which
a people gives itself to a king, let’s examine (1) the act by
which the people became a people; for (1) must occur before
(2), so that (1) is the true foundation of society.

[This is the work’s first occurrence of that phrase.]

Indeed, if there were no prior agreement, what would give
the minority any obligation to submit to the choice of the
majority (unless the election was unanimous)? A hundred
men want to have a master; what gives them the right to vote
on behalf of ten who don’t? The law of majority voting is itself
something established by agreement, and it presupposes
that on at least one occasion there was a unanimous vote.

The clauses of this contract are so settled by the nature
of the act that the slightest change would make them null
and void; so that although they may never have been explicitly stated, they are everywhere the same and everywhere
tacitly accepted and recognised, until the social compact [see
Glossary] is violated and each individual regains his •original
6

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

rights and resumes his •natural liberty, while losing the
liberty-by-agreement which had been his reason for renouncing •them.
Properly understood, these clauses come down to one—
the total alienation [see Glossary] of each associate, together
with all his rights, to the whole community. ·This may
seem drastic, but three features of it make it reasonable·.
(i) Because each individual gives himself entirely, what is
happening here for any one individual is the same as what
is happening for each of the others, and, because this is
so, no-one has any interest in making things tougher for
everyone but himself.
(ii) Because the alienation is made without reserve, ·i.e.
without anything being held back·, the union is as complete
as it can be, and no associate has anything more to demand.
·To see why the association has to be done in this way,
consider· what the situation would be if the individuals
retained certain rights. In the absence of any superior to
decide issues about this, each individual would be his own
judge in the first case that came up, and this would lead
him to ask to be his own judge across the board; this would
continue the state of nature, and the association would
necessarily become inoperative or tyrannical.
(iii) Each man in giving himself to everyone gives himself
to no-one; and •the right over himself that the others get is
matched by •the right that he gets over each of them. So he
gains as much as he loses, and also gains extra force for the
2

The social compact

preservation of what he has.
Filtering out the inessentials, we’ll find that the social
compact comes down to this:
’Each of us puts his person and all his power in
common under the supreme direction of the general
will, and, in our corporate capacity, we receive each
member as an indivisible part of the whole.’
[This is the first occurrence in this work of the phrase ‘the general will’.]

This act of association instantly replaces •the individualperson status of each contracting party by •a moral and
collective body, composed of as many members as the
assembly has voix [= ‘voices’ or ‘votes’]; and receiving from this
act its unity, its common identity, its life and its will. This
public person that is formed by the union of all the other
persons used to be called a ‘city’,2 and these days is called a
‘republic’ or a ‘body politic’. Its members call it
•a ‘state’ when thinking of it as passive,
•a ‘sovereign’ when thinking of it as active, and
•a ‘power’ when setting it alongside others of the same
kind.
Those who are associated in it are collectively called ‘a
people’, and are separately called ‘citizens’ (as sharing in the
sovereign power) and ‘subjects’ (as being under the state’s
laws. But these terms are often muddled and confused with
one another: it is enough to know how to distinguish them
when they are being used with precision.

The real meaning of ‘city’ has been almost wholly lost in modern times; most people mistake a town for a city, and a townsman for a citizen. They
don’t know that houses make a town, but citizens a city. . . . I have never read of the title ‘citizens’ being given to the subjects of any prince, not even
the ancient Macedonians or the English of today, though they are nearer liberty than anyone else. Only the French casually adopt the label ‘citizens’;
that’s because they have no idea of its real meaning (you can see that from their dictionaries!). . . . They think of the name as expressing •a virtue
rather than •a right. When Bodin was trying to talk about our citizens and our townsmen, he blundered badly by confusing these two classes with
one another. M. d’Alembert avoided that error in his article on Geneva, clearly distinguishing the four orders of men (or even five, counting mere
foreigners) who dwell in our town, of which only two make up the republic. I don’t know of any other French writer who has understood the real
meaning of the word ‘citizen’.

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

7. The sovereign

1 7.

The sovereign

But the body politic, i.e. the sovereign, owes its very
existence to the sanctity of •the contract; so it can never
commit itself, even to another state, to do anything that
conflicts with •that original act—e.g. to alienate any part of
itself, or to submit to another sovereign. ·I’m saying not that
the sovereign ought not to do such a thing, but that it can’t
do so·: violation of the act ·of contract-making· by which it
exists would be self-annihilation; and nothing can be created
by something that has gone out of existence!
As soon as this multitude is united into one body in this
way, any offence against one of the members is an attack on
the body, and any offence against the body will be resented
by the members. Thus, the two contracting parties—the
individual member and the body politic—are obliged by duty
and by self-interest to give each other help. . . .
Now, because the sovereign is made out of nothing but its
constituent individuals, it doesn’t and can’t have any interest
contrary to theirs; so there’s no need for it to provide its
subjects with guarantee ·of treating them well·, because •the
body can’t possibly wish to hurt all its members, and—as
we’ll see later on—•it can’t hurt any individual one of them
either. The sovereign, merely by virtue of what it is, is always
what it ought to be.
But the situation is different with respect to the relation of
the subjects to the sovereign: despite their common interest,
the sovereign would have no security that the subjects would
behave as they have committed themselves to behaving
unless it found some way to be assured of their fidelity.
The fact is that each individual •as a man can have
a particular will that doesn’t fit, and even conflicts with,
the general will that he has •as a citizen. His individual
self-interest may speak to him quite differently from how the
common interest does. He looks at the situation in this way:

This formula shows us that •the act of association involves a
two-way commitment between the public and the individuals
·belonging to it·, and •that each individual, in making a contract with himself (so to speak), acquires two commitments:
(a) as a member of the state he has a commitment to the
sovereign, and (b) as a member of the sovereign [see Glossary]
he has a commitment to each of the individuals, he being
one of them. There is a maxim of civil law that no-one is
bound by undertakings he has made to himself, but that
doesn’t apply here, because the present topic is incurring an
obligation to •a whole of which one is a part, and that is very
different from incurring an obligation to •oneself.
The proceeding I have been describing can’t give the
sovereign a commitment to itself. As I have just pointed
out, an individual subject can have a commitment to himself
in this sense: as an individual he has a commitment to
the sovereign, and as a member of the sovereign he has
a commitment to himself. But the sovereign can’t have a
commitment to itself; it doesn’t have two distinct roles ·such
that a commitment could go from it in one role and towards it
in the other·. For the sovereign to have a commitment to itself
would be like an individual person having a commitment to
himself; it just isn’t possible. And so it is against the nature
of the body politic for the sovereign to impose on itself a law
that it can’t infringe: there isn’t and can’t be any kind of
basic law that is binding on the body of the people—even
the social contract itself can’t do that. This doesn’t mean
that the body politic can’t enter into commitments with
others [i.e. with other states]. . . . It can do that, because in
relation to what is external to it—·i.e. in relation to other
states or sovereigns·—the sovereign is just a simple being,
an individual.

The civil state

that they formerly lacked. The voice of duty has taken over
from physical impulses and ·a sense of what is· right has
take over from appetite; and now—only now—the man who
has until now considered only himself finds himself forced to
act on different principles and to consult his reason before
listening to his inclinations. In this ·civil· state he is deprived
of many advantages that he got from nature, but he gets
enormous benefits in return—his faculties are so stimulated
and developed, his ideas are extended, his feelings ennobled,
and his whole soul uplifted. All this happens to such an
extent that if the abuses of this new condition didn’t often
pull him down to something lower than he was in •the state
of nature, he would be bound to bless continually the happy
moment that took him from •it for ever, and out of a dull and
limited animal made a thinking being, a man.
Let us get a statement of profit and loss in terms that
make it easy to compare the two sides. What man loses by
the social contract is
•his natural liberty and
•an unrestricted right to anything he wants and can
get.
What he gains
•civil liberty and
•the ownership of everything he possesses.
If we’re to weigh these up accurately, we must distinguish
•natural liberty, which is limited only by the individual’s powers, from
•civil liberty, which is limited by the general will.
And we must distinguish
•possession, which is merely the effect of force or the
principle of ‘first come, first served’, from
•property, which can only be based on a positive title.
We could add on the ‘profit’ side the fact that in the civil state
a man acquires moral liberty, which alone makes him truly

’I have an absolute and naturally independent existence; ·I’m not something that exists only because
certain items have come together in an association·.
So what I am said to ‘owe’ to the common cause—·i.e.
to the body politic or sovereign whose existence is in
that way dependent on the conduct of its members·—
is really a gift, a hand-out; if I withhold it, that won’t
harm anyone else as much as it will benefit me. As
for the ‘moral person’ that constitutes the state, that’s
not a man but a mere mental construct.’
So he may wish to enjoy the rights of citizenship without
being ready to fulfill the duties of a subject; and if that went
on for long enough it would destroy the body politic.
To protect the social compact from being a mere empty
formula, therefore, it silently includes the undertaking that
anyone who refuses to obey the general will is to be compelled
to do so by the whole body. This single item in the compact
can give power to all the other items. It means nothing less
than that each individual will be forced to be free. ·It’s
obvious how forcing comes into this, but. . . to be free? Yes·,
because this is the condition which, by giving each citizen
to his country, secures him against all personal dependence,
·i.e. secures him against being taken by anyone or anything
else·. This is the key to the working of the political machine;
it alone legitimises civil commitments which would otherwise
be absurd, tyrannical, and liable to frightful abuses.

8. The civil state
This passage from •the state of nature to •the civil state
produces a very remarkable change in man: the role that
instinct used to play in his conduct is now taken over by ·a
sense of· justice, and his actions now have a moral aspect

master of himself; for the drive of sheer appetite is •slavery,
while obedience to a law that we prescribe to ourselves is
•liberty. But I have said too much about this in other places;
and the philosophical meaning of the word ‘liberty’ doesn’t
concern us here.

1 9.

Real estate

Having acquired share, he ought to limit himself to that,
and can’t have any further claim on the community. That’s
why the first-occupier right, which is so weak in the state of
nature, claims the respect of every man in civil society. What
a man respects in this right is not so much •what belongs to
someone else as •what doesn’t belong to him.
In general, to authorize a first occupier’s right over any
bit of ground three conditions must be satisfied:
•the ground wasn’t already occupied by someone else;
•he occupies only as much as he needs for his subsistence;
•he takes possession of this ground not by an empty
ceremony but by labour and cultivation.
His work on the land is the only sign of ownership that others
should respect if he doesn’t have a legal title.
In allowing the right of first occupancy on condition that
the land was needed and was worked on, aren’t we stretching
that right as far as it can go? Could such a right be left with
no limits or restrictions? To claim to be the master of a plot
of common ground will it be enough merely to set foot on
it? If a man has the strength to expel others for a moment,
does that deprive them of any right to return? If a man or
a people seize an immense territory and shut out the rest
of the world, won’t this be merely a grab that ought to be
punished? ·The answer is surely ‘yes’·, because such an act
steals from others the living-space and means of subsistence
that nature gave them in common. When Balboa stood on
the sea-shore and took possession of the south seas and the
whole of South America in the name of the Spanish crown,
was that enough to dispossess all their actual inhabitants
and to shut out from those territories all the princes of the
world? If so, there’s no need for all these ceremonies; the
Catholic King can take possession of the whole universe all
at once, tacking on a rider excluding from his claim any

9. Real estate
At the moment when the community comes into existence,
each of its members gives himself to it—himself just as he is,
with any powers that he has, including all his possessions.
It is not the case that this transfer of all his goods changes
them from being •possessions in his hands to being •property
in the hands of the sovereign; but because the city’s powers
are incomparably greater than any individual’s, public possession is stronger and more irrevocable, without being any
more legitimate. [The rest of this paragraph is expanded in ways that
the ·small dots· convention can’t easily signify.] Actually, from the
point of view of the members of this state its possession of
each member’s goods [is legitimate, because the state is the
master of all their goods by the social contract which is the
basis of all rights within the state. But that doesn’t hold for
foreigners, because for them ownership depends solely on
the ‘first come, first served’ principle, which also serves for
states in their ownership of territory.
Of the two ways of getting a right to something in the
state of nature, namely
(i) being the first occupier of it, and
(ii) being the strongest,
(i) provides a right—‘·first come, first served·’—that is more
real than (ii) does; but it doesn’t become a true right until
property-rights are established. Every man has naturally a
right to everything he needs; but the positive act that makes
something his property excludes him from everything else.
10

The Social Contract

Real estate

public good has been entrusted, and •having their rights
respected by all the state’s members and maintained against
foreign aggression by all its forces, have made a transfer that
benefits both the public and still more themselves, thereby
acquiring (as it were) everything that they gave up. This
paradox is easily explained by distinguishing the sovereign’s
right from the owner’s rights over the same estate—as we
shall see later on.
It can also happen that men •begin to unite before they
possess anything, •subsequently occupy a tract of land that
is enough for them all, and then •enjoy it in common, or
share it out among themselves (either equally or in proportions fixed by the sovereign). But however the acquisition
is made, each individual’s right to his own estate is always
subordinate to the community’s right over everyone’s estate;
without this, the social tie would be fragile and the exercise
of sovereignty would be feeble.
To bring this chapter and this book to an end, I’ll remark
on a fact that should be the basis for any social system,
namely: The basic compact doesn’t destroy natural inequality; rather, it replaces •such physical inequalities as nature
may have set up between men by •an equality that is moral
and legitimate, so that men who may be unequal in strength
or intelligence become equal by agreement and legal right.3

territories that were already possessed by other princes!
We can imagine •how adjacent pieces of land belonging
to individuals become, when they are combined, public
territory, and •how the right of sovereignty over the subjects comes to be extended to being a right over their real
estate. This makes the land-owners even more dependent
·on the sovereign·; ·they have more to lose if things go wrong
between them and the sovereign; and· this is a guarantee
of their fidelity. The advantage of this apparently wasn’t felt
by ancient monarchs, who called themselves kings of the
Persians, the Scythians, or the Macedonians, apparently
regarding themselves as rulers of men rather than as masters
of a country. Today’s kings are cleverer: they call themselves
kings of France, of Spain, of England and so on. Holding
the land in this way, they are quite confident of holding the
inhabitants.
This alienation in which individuals transfer their goods
to the community has a special feature, namely that far from
•depriving the individuals of their goods it •assures them of
legitimate possession, changing
•‘I have taken possession of this (somehow)’ into ‘I have
a genuine right to this’, and
•’I have the enjoyment of this’ into ‘I own this’.
Thus the possessors, •in their role as those to whom the

Under bad governments, this equality is only apparent and illusory: all it does is to keep the pauper in his poverty and the rich man in the position
he has usurped. Laws in fact are always useful to those who have possessions and harmful to those who don’t; from which it follows that the social
state is advantageous to men only when everyone has something and no-one has too much.

Sovereignty is indivisible

BOOK 2
1. Sovereignty is inalienable

because it’s absurd for the will to bind itself for the future,
and no will is obliged to consent to anything that isn’t for
the good of the being whose will it is. If then the populace
promises simply to obey, by that very act it dissolves itself
and loses what makes it a people; the moment a master
exists, there is no longer a sovereign, and from that moment
the body politic has ceased to exist.
This isn’t to deny that rulers’ commands can count as
general wills, if the sovereign is free to oppose them and
doesn’t do so. In such a case, universal silence should be
taken to show the people’s consent. I’ll explain this fully later
on.

The first and most important consequence of the principles I
have laid down is that the directing of the state in the light of
the object for which it was instituted, i.e. the common good,
must be done by the general will. The •clashing of particular
interests made it •necessary to establish a society, and the
•agreement of those same interests made it •possible to do
so. It’s the common element in these different interests that
forms the social tie; and if there were there nothing that they
all had in common, no society could exist. It is solely by this
common interest that every society should be governed.
I hold then that sovereignty, being nothing less than
the exercise of the general will, can never be alienated [see
Glossary], and that the sovereign, which is nothing but a
collective being, can’t be represented except by itself: the
power indeed may be transmitted, but not the will.
Perhaps a particular will could agree on some point with
the general will, but at least it’s impossible for such an
agreement to be lasting and constant. Why? Because
it’s of the very nature of a particular will to tend towards
•favouritism, be •partial [i.e. to favour some people over others],
whereas the general will tends towards •equality. It is even
more impossible to have any guarantee of this agreement;
for even if it did always exist that would be the effect not of
skill but of chance. The sovereign may indeed say:
‘Right now I will what that man wills (or at least what
he says he wills)’,
but it can’t say
’What that man wills tomorrow, I too shall will’,
4

2. Sovereignty is indivisible
For the same reason that makes it inalienable, sovereignty
is indivisible. Here is why. Either will (a) is general4 or it (b)
isn’t; it is the will either of (a) the body of the people or of (b)
only a part of it. When it is declared, then, either (a) it is an
act of sovereignty and constitutes law, or (b) it is merely a
particular will or
the rest of the sentence: un acte de magistrature ; c’est un

décret tout au plus.
which literally means: an act of magistracy—at the most a

decree.
what Rousseau was getting at: regulations laid down by

high-level bureaucrats, not basic laws issuing from the
legislature, the sovereign. [Re ‘magistracy’, see Glossary.]
But our political theorists, unable to divide sovereignty on

To be general, a will need not always be unanimous; but every vote must be counted: any exclusion is a breach of generality.

12

the basis of its •source, divide it according to its •object.
They divide it into
•force and will,
•legislative power and executive power,
•rights of taxation, justice and war,
•internal affairs and foreign relations.
Sometimes they run these sections together and sometimes
they separate them; they turn the sovereign into a fantastic
being composed of several connected pieces: it is as if they
were making man of several bodies, one with eyes, one with
arms, another with feet, and each with nothing else! We’re
told that the jugglers of Japan dismember a child before
the eyes of the spectators; then they throw the pieces into
the air one after another, and the child falls down alive and
whole. The conjuring tricks of our political theorists are
pretty much like that: having dismembered the body politic
by a huckster’s trick they then re-asssemble it. . . somehow!
This error comes from a failure to think precisely about
the sovereign authority, regarding as different •parts of it
what are really just different •emanations from it.

2 2.

Sovereignty is indivisible

If we track the other divisions in the same way, we
would find that whenever anyone takes sovereignty to be
divided there is a mistake: the rights that are taken as being
part of sovereignty are really all subordinate, and always
presuppose the existence of supreme wills that they are
merely applying.
This lack of exactness has thrown a cloud of obscurity
over the conclusions of writers on political right who have
laid down principles on the basis of which to pass judgment
on the respective rights of kings and peoples. When I try to
say how much obscurity, words fail me! Everyone can see in
Grotius’s work (Book 1 chapters 3 and 4) how the learned
man and his translator, Barbeyrac, entangle and confuse
themselves with in their own sophistries, for fear of saying
too little or too much of what they think, and so offending
the interests they have to placate. Grotius, a refugee in
France, discontented with his own country [Holland], and
wanting to pay court to Louis XIII, to whom his book is
dedicated, will go to any lengths to strip the peoples of all
their rights and clothe kings in them with every conceivable
decoration. This would also have been much to the taste
of Barbeyrac, who dedicated his translation to George I of
England. But unfortunately ·for him· the expulsion of James
II, which Barbeyrac called his ‘abdication’, compelled him
to be on his guard, to shuffle and switch positions, in order
to avoid making William ·of Orange, who succeeded James
on the throne· a usurper. If these two writers had adopted
the true principles, all ·their· difficulties would have been
removed, and they would have been always consistent; but
they’d have told the truth sadly, and they wouldn’t have
been paying court to anyone except the people. Well, the
truth is no road to fortune, and the populace doesn’t give
out ambassadorships, university chairs, or pensions.

[Rousseau seems to mean that they are just different actions that are performed under the authority of the sovereign. In distinguishing (a) parts of
the sovereign authority from (b) actions performed not by the sovereign
authority but by subordinate governmental agencies, he may be
distinguishing parts of x from actions of x, or
distinguishing the sovereign’s actions from those of subordinate
agencies.
In fact he seems to be thinking only of the second of these distinctions.

Thus, for example, the acts of declaring war and
making peace have been regarded as acts of sovereignty, but
they aren’t. None of them are laws; each of them simply
applies a law to a particular case, involving a decision ·not
about what the law is to be, but only· about how the law
applies in this case. This will be clear when the idea attached
to the word ‘law’ has been fixed.

3. Can the general will be wrong?

2 4.

The limits of the sovereign power

general will of its members—is still a particular [particulière]
will so far as the state is concerned; so that it can then be
said that as many votes as there are men is replaced by as
many votes as there are associations. The particular wills
become less numerous and give a less general result. And
when one of these associations is so great as to prevail over
all the rest, the result is no longer a sum of small particular
wills but a single particular will; and then there is no longer a
general will, and the opinion that prevails is purely particular
[particulier ].
If the general will is to emerge clearly it’s important that
there should be no partial society within the state, and that
each citizen should think only his own thoughts:6 which
was indeed the sublime and unique system established by
the great Lycurgus. And if there are partial societies, it’s
best to have as many as possible and to prevent them from
becoming unequal, as was done by Solon, Numa and Servius.
These precautions are the only ones that can ensure that
the general will is always enlightened and that the populace
is never in error.

It follows from all this that the general will is always in the
right and always works for the public good; but it doesn’t
follow that the people’s deliberations are always equally
correct. Our will is always for our own good, but we don’t
always see what that is; the populace is never corrupted,
but it is often deceived, and then—but only then—it seems
to will something bad. [The French for Rousseau’s endorsement of
the general will is toujours droite, which has been translated as ‘always
right’ and also as ‘always within its rights’; the matter is controversial.
The rendering ‘in the right’—here and twice more—is a cowardly compromise.]

The •will of all is very different from the •general will;
the latter looks only to the common interest, while the
former looks to private interest and is no more than a sum
of particular wills: but remove from these same wills the
pluses and minuses that cancel one another5 and what is
left of the particular wills adds up to the general will. [In
that sentence, and four times in the next paragraph, ‘particular will(s)’
translates Rousseau’s différence(s)’, which in this one context he uses in
an oddly non-relational way.]

4. The limits of the sovereign power

If the populace held its deliberations (on the basis of
adequate information) without the citizens communicating
with one another, what emerged from all the little particular
wills would always be the general will, and the decision
would always be good. But when plots and deals lead to
the formation of •partial associations at the expense of •the
big association, the will of each of these associations—the
5

If the state or city is nothing but a moral person whose life
consists in the union of its parts, and if its most important
concern is for its own preservation, it must have a universal
force to move and place each part in the way that is most
advantageous to the whole. Just as nature gives each man
absolute power over all his members, the social compact

‘Every interest’, says the Marquis d’Argenson, ‘has different principles. What brings two particular interests into agreement is their ·shared·
opposition to a third.’ He could have added that what brings all interests into agreement is their ·shared· opposition to each. If individual interests
didn’t differ from one another, the common interest would have nothing to bump up against, and so it would hardly be felt. . . .
‘In fact,’ says Machiavelli, ‘some divisions are harmful to a republic and some are advantageous. Those that stir up sects and parties are harmful;
those attended by neither are advantageous. So, since the founder of a Republic can’t help enmities arising, he ought at least to prevent them from
growing into sects’ (History of Florence, Book 7).

14

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

gives the body politic absolute power over all its members;
and I repeat that it is this power which, under the direction
of the general will, is called ‘sovereignty’.
But as well as the public person, we have to consider the
private persons who compose it, and whose life and liberty
are naturally independent of it. So now there’s the matter of
clearly distinguishing
•the citizens’ rights from the sovereign’s,7 and
•the citizens’ duties as subjects from their natural
rights as men.
Agreed: each man alienates by the social compact only
the part of his powers, goods and liberty that it is important
for the community to control. But something else should also
be agreed: the sovereign is sole judge of what is important.
Any service a citizen can give to the state should be
performed as soon as the sovereign demands it; but the
sovereign on its side can’t impose upon its subjects any
fetters that are useless to the community. Indeed it can’t
even want to do so, because ·there’s no reason for it to want
to, and· ‘Nothing can happen without a cause’ applies under
the law of reason as much as it does under the law of nature.
The undertakings that bind us to the social body are
obligatory only because they go both ways; and their nature
is such that in fulfilling them we can’t work for others without
working for ourselves. Why is the general will always in the
right, and why do •all continually will the happiness of •each?
It can only be because there’s not a man who doesn’t think
of ‘each’ as meaning him, and considers himself in voting for
all. This shows that equality of rights, and the idea of justice
arising from it, originate in •the preference each man gives to
himself, and accordingly •in human nature. It shows •that
the general will, to be really general, must be
7

2 4.

The limits of the sovereign power

general in its object as well as its essence; i.e. must
come from all and apply to all;
and •that when it is directed to some particular and determinate object it loses its natural rightness, because in such a
case we—·the joint owners of the general will·—are judging
of something foreign to us, so that we don’t have any genuine
standards to guide us.
Indeed, as soon as a question of particular fact or right
arises in some context that hasn’t already been regulated
by a general agreement, the matter becomes contentious.
It is a case—·like a trial in a court of law·—where the
individuals concerned are on one side and the public are
on the other; but I can’t see what law should be followed or
what judge should decide. Couldn’t we ask the general will
for an explicit decision on this matter? That is an absurd
proposal: the deliverance of the general will can only be the
conclusion of one of the sides and will therefore be seen by
the other as merely an external and particular will that is
subject to error and has on this occasion fallen into injustice.
Thus, just as a particular will can’t represent the general
will, the general will. . . .—just because it is general—can’t
pronounce on a particular man or fact. When for instance
the Athenian populace nominated or displaced its rulers,
decreeing honours for one and penalties for another, and
by hosts of particular decrees exercised all the functions of
government indiscriminately, it no longer had a general will
in the strict sense; it was acting no longer as sovereign, but
as magistrate [see Glossary]. This will seem contrary to current
views; but you should give me time to expound my own.
So you can see that what makes the will general is less
the number of voices than the common interest uniting them;
for under this system each person necessarily submits to

Attentive readers, please don’t rush in with the charge that I am contradicting myself. The poverty of the language has forced this on me; but wait
and see.

15

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

the conditions he imposes on others; and this admirable
alignment of •interest with •justice gives to the common
deliberations a quality of fairness, evenness of balance,
which is visibly absent from the discussion of any particular
issue, in the absence of a common interest that would bring
unity. . . .
From whatever direction we approach our principle, we
always reach the same conclusion: the social compact creates an equality among the citizens so that they all commit
themselves to observe the same conditions and should all
have the same rights. Thus, from the very nature of the
compact, every act of sovereignty—i.e. every authentic act of
the general will—obliges or favours all the citizens equally; so
that the sovereign recognises only the body of the nation and
doesn’t distinguish among the individuals of whom it is made
up. Then what strictly speaking is an act of sovereignty? It’s
not an agreement between a superior and an inferior, but an
agreement between the body and each of its members—an
agreement that is
•legitimate, because it is based on the social contract,
•equitable, because everyone takes part in it,
•useful, because the only object it can have is the
general good, and
•stable, because guaranteed by the public force and
the supreme power.
So long as the subjects have to submit only to agreements
of this sort, they don’t obey anyone—only their own will;
and to ask how far the respective rights of the sovereign
and the citizens extend is to ask ·not two questions but
only one, namely·: Up to what point can the citizens make
commitments to themselves, each to all and all to each?
This shows •that the sovereign power—utterly absolute,
sacred and inviolable as it is—doesn’t and can’t cross the
boundaries set by general agreements, and •that every man

2 4.

The limits of the sovereign power

can do what he likes with any goods and liberty that these
agreements leave him; so that it is never right for the
sovereign to burden one subject more heavily than another,
because that involves a particular decision and ·therefore·
isn’t within the range of the sovereign’s legitimate activity.
Once these distinctions are admitted, it is ·seen to be·
false that the social contract involves any real renunciation
on the part of the individuals; so false that the situation that
the contract puts them into is really preferable to the one
they were in before. Instead of an alienation [see Glossary],
they have made an advantageous exchange, trading in
•an uncertain and precarious way of living for •one
that is better and more secure;
•natural independence for •liberty,
•the power to harm others for •security for themselves,
and
•their strength, which others might overcome, for •a
right that social union makes invincible.
Even their life, which they have dedicated to the state, is
constantly protected by it; and when they risk it in the state’s
defence, aren’t they just giving back what they have received
from it? What are they doing that they wouldn’t do oftener
and more dangerously in the state of nature, in which they
would inevitably have to risk their lives in battles in defence
of their means of survival? Everyone does indeed have to
fight when his country needs him; but then no-one ever has
to fight for himself. We may have to run certain risks on
behalf of the source of our security; the alternative is to lose
our security and run greater risks on behalf of ourselves;
haven’t we profited by this exchange?

5. The right of life and death

2 5.

The right of life and death

survival is inconsistent with his survival, and one of the two
must die; when we put the guilty to death, we’re doing this
not so much to a citizen as to an enemy. He has broken the
social treaty—the investigation and trial show this, and the
judgment declares it—so he is no longer a member of the
state. But he has recognised himself as a member if only by
living there; so he must be lopped off
by exile, as a violator of the compact, or
by death, as a public enemy.
Such an enemy isn’t a •moral person [see Glossary], he’s a
•man; and in such a case the right of war is to kill the
vanquished.
You’ll say ‘But the condemnation of a criminal is a particular act ·and is therefore, according to your chapter 4 of this
Part, not something that the sovereign can do·. Right! But
this condemnation is not something the sovereign does; it’s
a right the sovereign that can confer without being able itself
to exert it. All my ideas hang together, but I can’t expound
them all at once.
We may add that frequent punishments [supplices = ‘punishments involving death or torture’] are always a sign that the
government is weak or lazy. Every wrong-doer could be
turned to some good. There’s no right to put to death, even
for the sake of making an example, anyone who could safely
be left alive.
The right of pardoning a guilty man, or letting him off
from a penalty imposed by the law and pronounced by the
judge, belongs only to the authority that is above the judge
and the law, i.e. the sovereign; and even its right in this
matter is far from clear, and it’s hardly ever called for. A
well-governed state has few punishments, not because there
are many pardons, but because criminals are rare: it’s easier
to get away with crimes when there are a great many of
them and the state is terminally ill. In the Roman republic

This question has been raised: ‘Given that individuals have
no right to dispose of their own lives, how can they give
that right to the sovereign, transferring something that they
don’t possess?’ This looks hard to answer only because it is
wrongly stated. Every man has a right to risk his own life in
order to preserve it. A man who jumps from a high window
to escape from a fire—is he ever said to be guilty of suicide?
Has that crime been alleged against anyone perishes in a
storm that he knew, when he went on board, had some
probability of occurring?
The social treaty aims for the preservation of the contracting parties. He who wills •the end also wills •the means, and
the means must involve some risks, and even some losses.
Someone who is willing to save •his life at others’ expense
should also be ready to give •it up for their sake, when there
is a need for this. Now, the citizen is no longer the judge of
the risks that the law wants him to run, and when the prince
says to him: ‘It is expedient for the state that you should die’,
he ought to die. Why? Because his life is no longer merely a
natural good, but is a gift made conditionally by the state;
·it is conditional on his always meeting the state’s demands,
and· it’s only on that condition that he has been living in
security up to the present.
The death-penalty for criminals can be seen in much the
same light: it is in order to save ourselves from assassins that
we consent to die if we become assassins. In this treaty—·this
social contract·—so far from disposing of our own lives, we
think only of securing them; and it isn’t to be assumed that
any of the parties then expects to get himself hanged!
Every criminal by attacking social rights becomes a rebel
and a traitor to his country; by violating its laws he stops
being a member of it—he even makes war on it. The state’s
17

neither the senate nor the consuls ever offered to pardon
·anyone·; nor did the populace, though it sometimes revoked
its own decision. Frequent pardons are an announcement
that before long crime will pay, and anyone can see where
that leads. But I feel my heart protesting and restraining
my pen; let us leave these questions to the just man who
has never offended and would himself never stand in need
of pardon!

The law

someone tells us what a law of nature is, that won’t bring us
any nearer to knowing what a law of the state is.
I have already said [page 15] that there is no general
will directed to a particular object. [Rousseau’s proof of that,
which follows, is severely compressed. The present version eases it out
in ways that the ·small dots· convention can’t easily signify.]

We are
to suppose that the general will of populace x dictates that
(for example) individual person y is to be given a pension.
Either y is a member of x or he isn’t. (i) If he isn’t, then
x’s will doesn’t count as a general will in relation to him—it
may have absolutely nothing to do with y’s own will. (ii)
If y is a member of x, i.e. a part of x, then x’s will that y
receive a pension is a relation between whole and part that
makes them two separate beings, •x-without-y and •y. But
x-without-y isn’t the whole; and while this relation persists
it’s a relation between two unequal parts; and it follows that
the will of one is no longer in any respect general in relation
to the other.
But when the whole people decrees for the whole people, it
is ·not looking outside itself, but· considering only itself; and
if a relation is then formed, it is ·not between two separate
objects, but only· between two aspects of a single entire
object, with no need to split it into two parts. In that case the
matter about which the decree is made is, like the decreeing
will, general. This act is what I call a law.
When I say that the object of laws is always general, I
mean that law considers subjects collectively and considers
kinds of actions, never a particular person or action. Thus
the law can decree that there shall be privileges, but it can’t
name anyone who is to get them. It can set up different
classes of citizens, and even stipulate the qualifications for
belonging to each of these classes, but it can’t pick out any
individuals as belonging to this or that class. It can establish
a monarchy with hereditary succession, but it can’t choose

6. The law
By the social compact we have given the body politic
•existence and •life; now it is up to legislation to give it
•movement and •will. The basic act that forms the body and
pulls it together does nothing to settle what it must do in
order to survive.
It’s the nature of things that makes an item good and in
conformity with order—human agreements don’t come into
it. All justice comes from God, who is its sole source; but if
we knew how to draw it from that high source we wouldn’t
need government or laws! No doubt there is a universal
justice emanating from reason alone, but this justice can
be admitted among us only if it is mutual. In the absence
of natural sanctions. . . .the laws of justice are ineffective
among men. . . . Agreements and laws are needed to join
rights to duties and relate justice to its object. In the state of
nature where everything is common, I don’t owe anything to
someone to whom I haven’t promised anything; I recognise
as belonging to others only what is of no use to me. It’s not
like that in the state of society, where all rights are fixed by
law.
But what, when we come down to it, is a law? As long as
we settle for attaching only metaphysical ideas to the word,
we’ll go on arguing without understanding one another. If

a king or name a royal family. In short, any action that has
an individual object falls outside the scope of the legislative
power.
We see at once that on this account of things certain
questions can be laid aside. ‘Whose business it is to make
laws?’ (They are acts of the general will.) ‘Is the prince is
above the law? (·No·, because he is a member of the state.)
‘Can the law be unjust?’ (·No·, because nothing is unjust
towards itself.) ‘How can we be both •free and •subject to the
laws? (·There’s no problem about this·, because the laws are
nothing but records of our volitions.)
We see further that because the law unites universality
of will with universality of object, nothing that a man—any
man—commands on his own initiative can be a law. That
holds even for the sovereign: what he or it commands with
regard to a particular matter is not a law but a decree, an
act not of sovereignty but of magistracy.
So I give the name ‘republic’ to any state governed by laws,
whatever form its administration takes; for only when the
laws govern does the public interest govern, and the public
thing is something real. [Rousseau expected his readers to recognize

The law

foresight to formulate and announce its acts in advance?
or how is it to announce them in the hour of need? How
can a blind multitude, which often doesn’t know what it
wills because it rarely knows what is good for it, carry out
for itself such a great and difficult enterprise as a system
of legislation? The populace left to itself always wills the
good, but left to itself it doesn’t always see what that is. The
general will is always in the right, but the judgment that
guides it isn’t always enlightened. It ought to be
•made to see objects as they are, and sometimes as
they ought to appear to it;
•shown the good road it is in search of,
•secured from the seductive influences of individual
wills,
•taught to look carefully at other places and times, and
•made to weigh the attractions of present and sensible
advantages against the danger of distant and hidden
evils.
Individuals see the good that they reject; the public wills the
good that it doesn’t see. Both need guidance. Individuals
must be made to bring their wills into line with their reason;
the populace must be taught to know what it wills. If
that is done, public enlightenment leads to the union of
understanding and will in the social body: the parts are
made to work exactly together, and the whole is raised to its
highest power. For this there has to be a law-maker.

that chose publique (= ‘public thing’) is in Latin res publica, which is the

Every legitimate government is

Laws are really only the conditions of civil association.
Because the populace is subject to the laws, it ought to
be their author: the conditions of •the society ought to be
regulated solely by those who come together to form •it. But
how will they do this? By a common agreement? By a sudden
inspiration? Does the body politic have an organ—·like vocal
cords and a tongue·—to declare its will? Who can give it the
origin of république (= ‘republic’).]

I apply this word not merely to aristocracies and democracies but quite generally to any government directed by the general will, which is the law.
To be legitimate, the government must be not identical with the sovereign, but its minister; so even a monarchy can be a republic. I’ll clarify this in
Book 3.

[In the French, as in this version, it’s clear that Rousseau is presenting
these not as three tasks but as three ways of looking at one task.]
In short, he must deprive man of •his own resources, replacing them by •new ones that are alien to him and that he

What would be needed to discover the best rules of society. . . .is a superior intelligence that could see all men’s
passions without having any of them. This intelligence would
have to meet these conditions:
•it is wholly unrelated to our nature, while knowing it
through and through;
•its happiness doesn’t depend on us, yet it concerns
itself with our happiness; and lastly
•it can take the long view, working in one century for
something to be enjoyed in the next.9
It would take gods to give men laws!. . . . But if a great prince
is a rare kind of man, what will a great legislator be? All the
prince has to do is to follow the pattern that the law-giver has
to lay down in the first place. The law-giver is the engineer
who invents the machine; the prince is merely the mechanic
who sets it up and makes it go. ‘At the birth of societies,’ says
Montesquieu, ‘the rulers of republics establish institutions,
and then the institutions mould the rulers’ (The Greatness
and Decadence of the Romans, ch. 1.)
Someone who ventures to tackle the task of making a
people needs to have a sense of being able
•to change human nature, so to speak—to transform
each individual, who on his own is a complete and
solitary whole, into part of a greater whole from which
he in a way receives his life and his being;
•to alter man’s constitution in order to strengthen it;
•to replace the physical and independent existence that
nature gave us by a partial and moral existence.

can’t employ without help from others. The more completely
those natural resources are annihilated, the greater and
more lasting are the new ones that he acquires, and the
more stable and perfect are the new institutions. ·If you find
that last statement extravagant, consider·: If each citizen is
nothing and can do nothing without all the others, and if the
resources acquired by the whole are equal or superior to the
natural forces of all the individuals put together, it can be
said that legislation is at the highest point of perfection.
The law-giver is an extraordinary man in the state. If
his intellectual abilities make him so, his office [here = ‘job’]
does also. It’s not magistracy or sovereignty. This work
that •constitutes the republic isn’t part of its •constitution;
it is an individual and superior role that has nothing in
common with human power; for if anyone who commands
men oughtn’t to have command over the laws, then anyone
who has command over the laws oughtn’t to have it over men;
for if he did, his laws would be the servants of his passions
and would often merely perpetuate his injustices; his private
aims would inevitably mar the sanctity of his work.
When Lycurgus gave laws to his country, he began by
abdicating as king. It was the custom of most Greek towns to
have foreigners establish their laws. The republics of modern
Italy in many cases followed this example; Geneva did the
same and profited by it.10 Rome was at its most prosperous

A people becomes famous only when its legislation begins to decline. We don’t know for how many centuries the system of Lycurgus made the
Spartans happy before the rest of Greece took any notice of it.
Those who know Calvin only as a theologian much under-estimate the extent of his genius. The codification of our wise edicts, in which he played
a large part, does him great honour. . . . Whatever revolution time may bring in our religion, so long as the spirit of patriotism and liberty still lives

the fundamental rules of statecraft, the effect would have
to become the cause! The social spirit that is to be created
by these institutions would have to preside over their very
foundation; and men would have to be, •in advance of the
laws, what they should become •by means of the laws. So
the law-maker, being unable to appeal either to •force or to
•reason, must resort to an authority of a different order that
can •constrain without violence and

[In the next sentence, Decemviri = ‘ten men’, referring to the men
who in the 5th century BCE were delegated to draw up a code of laws for

Nevertheless, the Decemviri themselves
never claimed the right to pass any law merely on their own
authority. ‘Nothing we propose to you’, they said to the
people, ‘can pass into law without your consent. Romans,
be yourselves the authors of the laws that are to make you
happy.’
So he who draws up the laws doesn’t or shouldn’t have
any right to legislate; and the populace can’t deprive itself
of this non-transferable right, even if it wants to, because
according to the basic compact the only thing that can bind
individuals is the general will, and the only way to be sure
that a particular will is in conformity with the general will is
to put it to a free vote of the people. I have already said this,
but it’s worth repeating it.
Thus in the task of law-giving we find two things together
that seem incompatible: an enterprise that surpasses human
powers, and for its execution an authority that isn’t anything!
Another difficulty deserves attention. Wise [see Glossary]
men who try to speak in their language to the common herd,
instead speaking as the herd does, have no chance of being
understood. There are countless kinds of ideas that can’t
possibly be translated into •the language of the people. Views
that are too broad and objects that are too distant are equally
out of •its range: each individual, having no taste for any
plan of government that doesn’t suit his particular interests,
can’t easily see the advantages he would get as payback for
the continual privations that good laws impose on him. For

able to relish sound principles of political theory and follow

reasons for this.
That’s what has down the centuries compelled •the fathers
of the nations to appeal to divine intervention and credit
the gods with •their own wisdom, in order that the peoples—
submitting to the laws of the state as to the laws of nature,
and recognising the power that formed the city as the very
one that formed mankind—might obey freely, and bear with
docility the yoke of the public happiness.
What the legislator puts into the mouth of the immortals
are decisions based on a high-flying reason that is far above
the range of the common herd, the aim being to constrain
by divine authority those who can’t be moved by human
prudence. But it’s not just anyone who can make the gods
speak, or be believed when he claims to be their interpreter.
The only miracle that can prove a legislator’s mission is his
great soul. Any man can
•engrave words on tablets of stone, or
•purchase the services of an oracle, or
•fake secret communication with some god, or
•train a bird to whisper in his ear, or
find other crude devices for imposing on the people. Someone

him a band of fools; but he’ll never found an empire, and
whatever crazy thing he does found will die soon after he
does. Idle tricks create a temporary bond; only wisdom can
make it permanent. The Judaic law, which still survives, and
Islamic law that has ruled half the world for ten centuries,
still today proclaim the great men who laid them down; and
while •proud philosophy and •the blind spirit of political
partisanship sees those men as nothing but lucky impostors,
the true political theorist admires in the institutions they set
up the great and powerful genius that presides over durable
political structures.
The right conclusion to draw from all this is not. . . .that
among us politics and religion have a common object, but
that when nations are first starting up religion is used as an
instrument for politics.

2 8.

The people

populace can’t stand having anyone touch its faults, even to
remedy them; it’s like the foolish and cowardly patients who
tremble at sight of the doctor.
I’m not denying that there are times in the history of
states when. . . .violence and revolutions jolt the populace
into remembering the past, so that the state, set on fire by
civil wars, is so to speak born again from its ashes, and with
a renewed vigour of youth springs from the jaws of death.
Examples: Sparta at the time of Lycurgus, Rome after the
Tarquins, and in our own day Holland and Switzerland after
the expulsion of the tyrants.
But such events are rare; they are exceptions, always
to be explained in terms of the particular constitution [see
Glossary] of the exceptional state. They can’t even happen
twice to the same people, for a populace can make itself free
as long as it is merely uncivilized, but not when the civic
spring has wound down. Then disturbances can destroy
it, but revolutions can’t rebuild it: it needs a master, not a
liberator. Free peoples, remember this maxim: ‘Liberty can
be gained, but it can never be recovered.’
Youth is not infancy. For nations, as for men, there is a
period of young adulthood—we may call it ‘maturity’—before
which a nation shouldn’t be made subject to laws; but it isn’t
always easy to recognise a people’s maturity, and if political
developments are set going before that, the developments will
fail. One people is amenable to discipline from the beginning;
another, not after ten centuries. The Russians will never be
really civilised, because they were ‘civilised’ too soon. Peter
·the Great· had a genius for imitation, but he didn’t have
the true creative genius that makes everything from nothing.
Some of the things he did were good, but most of them were
wrong for that time and place. He saw that his populace was
barbarous, but didn’t see that it was not ripe for civilisation:
he wanted to civilise it when all it needed was to be prepared

8. The people
Before putting up a large building, the architect surveys and
tests the ground to see if it can support the weight; and in the
same way the wise legislator doesn’t start by laying down his
good laws but by investigating whether the populace they are
intended for is in a condition to receive them. Plato refused
to legislate for the Arcadians and the Cyreniens because he
knew that both peoples were rich and couldn’t put up with
equality; and Crete had good laws and bad men because all
Minos had done was to impose discipline on a people already
burdened with vice.
A thousand nations that shone around the earth couldn’t
endure good laws for long, and most couldn’t have endured
them at all. Most peoples, like most men, are teachable only
in youth; as they grow old they become impossible to correct.
Once customs have become established and prejudices are
dug in, trying to reform them is dangerous and useless; the

for war. At first he wanted to make Germans, Englishmen,
when he ought to have started by making Russians; he
blocked his subjects from ever becoming what they could
have been, by persuading them that they were what they are
not. This was like a French teacher who shapes his pupil to
be an infant prodigy, and for the rest of his life to be nothing.
The empire of Russia will try to conquer Europe, and will
itself be conquered. The Tatars, its subjects or neighbours,
will become its masters and ours, by a revolution that seems
to me inevitable. Indeed, all the kings of Europe are working
together to speed it along.

The people (continued)

you go, and always at the expense of the unfortunate people!
Last of all comes the supreme administration, which swamps
all the rest. These costs are a continual drain on the subjects;
and far from being better governed by all these different levels
of government they’re much worse governed than they would
be if they had only a single authority over them. And with all
this going on, there are hardly any resources remaining to
meet emergencies; and whenever these are needed the state
is on the brink of destruction.
(2) ·The effectiveness of government:· When part of a
nation is far distant from the seat of government, this has
bad effects on both sides. On the one hand, the government
is weaker and slower
•in law-enforcement there,
•in preventing people from ill-treating one another
there,
•in correcting abuses there,
• guarding against seditious undertakings begun there;
and on the other hand the populace of that region has less
affection for
•its rulers, whom it never sees,
•its country, which to its eyes seems like the world,
and
•its fellow-citizens, most of whom are unknown to it.
The same laws can’t suit so many diverse provinces with
different mœurs [see Glossary] and utterly different climates,
differing also in what kind of government they can put up
with. ‘·Well, then, let the government have different laws for
different provinces.’ No, because· different laws lead only
to trouble and confusion among populations which—living
under the same rulers and in constant communication with
one another—intermingle and intermarry, and when they
come under the sway of new customs don’t know whether
they can call their family fortune their own. Among such

9. The people (continued)
Just as nature has set limits to the size of a well-made
man, and outside those limits makes only giants and dwarfs,
so also for the constitution of a state to be at its best,
there are upper and lower bounds to the size of the state
if it isn’t to be too large for good government or too small
for self-maintenance. Every body politic has a maximum
strength that it can’t exceed, and that it won’t even reach
that maximum if it becomes too large. Every extension of the
social tie slackens it; and generally speaking a small state is
stronger in proportion than a great one. There are countless
reasons why this is so. ·I shall present one of them, and
then a cluster of others·.
(1) ·The burden of government:· Long distances make
administration more difficult, just as a weight becomes
heavier at the end of a longer lever. The further up the
hierarchy you go, the more burdensome the administrations
is. First, each •city has its own ·government·, which is
paid for by the people; so does each •district, still paid
for by the people; then each •province, then the •great
governments. . . .and so on, always costing more the higher
23

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

a multitude of men who don’t know one another, crammed
together at the seat of the central administration, talent is
buried, virtue unknown and vice unpunished. The leaders,
overwhelmed with business, don’t see anything for themselves; the state is governed by bureaucrats. Finally, the
measures that have to be taken to maintain the general
authority, which all these distant officials wish to evade or
abuse, absorb all the governmental energy, so that there’s
none left for the happiness of the people, and barely enough
to defend it when need arises. That’s what happens when
a body is too big for its constitution: it cracks, and falls
crushed under its own weight.
On the other hand, ·it’s bad for a state to be too small·.
A state needs a secure base if it is to be stable—not shaken
to pieces by •the shocks that are bound to come its way or
by •the efforts it will be forced to make to maintain itself. All
populations have a kind of centrifugal force by which they
•continually act against one another, and •tend to enlarge
themselves at their neighbours’ expense—like Descartes’s
vortices! Thus the weak run the risk of being soon swallowed
up; and it is almost impossible for any one ·state· to survive
except by putting itself in a sort of equilibrium with all ·the
others· so that the pressure on all sides is about equal.
So you can see that there are reasons for contraction
and reasons for expansion; and it’s no small part of the
statesman’s skill to balance out the two sides in the way that
is best for the preservation of the state. It can be said that
the reasons for expansion, being merely external and
relative,
should be subordinate to
the reasons for contraction, which are internal and
absolute.
A strong and healthy constitution is the first thing to look
for; and it is better to count on the vigour that comes from

2 10.

The people (further continued)

good government than on the resources a great territory
furnishes.
I would add that we have known states that •were so constituted that the need to make conquests entered into their
very constitution, and •had to expand ceaselessly merely
in order to survive. Perhaps they congratulated themselves
greatly on this fortunate necessity; yet what it marked out
for them were the limits of their greatness and the inevitable
moment of their fall.

10. The people (further continued)
A body politic can be measured by the extent of its territory
or by the number of its people; and the relation between
these two needs to be right if a state is to be really great. The
men make the state, and the territory sustains the men; so
the right relation is this:
the land should suffice to maintain the inhabitants,
and there should be as many inhabitants as the land
can feed.
That’s the proportion that provides the maximum strength
of a given number of people. If there’s too much land, it
will be troublesome to protect, inadequately cultivated, and
over-productive; it will give rise to defensive wars; if there
isn’t enough land, the state has to depend on its neighbours
to meet some of its needs; this will give rise to offensive
wars. Any population whose geographical situation forces it
to choose between commerce and war is intrinsically weak:
it depends on its neighbours, depends on outcomes; its
existence will be uncertain and short. It either conquers
others and changes its ·geographical· situation, or it is
conquered and becomes nothing. Only insignificance or
greatness can keep it free.
24

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

There’s no way of stating the ideal relation of size to
population—n hectares per m people—because that varies according to differences in •the quality and fertility of the land,
in •the nature of what grows on it, in •the climate, and in
•the temperaments of the people who live on the land. Some
people live in a fertile countryside and consume little, others
living on poor soil eat a lot. The legislator also has to take
into account regional differences in the fertility of women, in
how favourable the land is to the growth of population, and
in how much difference is likely to be made by governmental
activity. So the legislator should go not by what he •sees but
by what he •foresees; he shouldn’t settle for the actual level
of the population but should aim for the level that it ought
naturally to attain. Lastly, there are countless situations
where the particular local circumstances demand or allow
the acquisition of more territory than seems necessary. Thus,
expansion will be great in a mountainous territory where the
natural products—i.e. woods and pastures—need less labour,
where it turns out that women are more fertile than in the
plains, and where a great expanse of slope presents only a
small level stretch that can be relied on for growing things.
On the other hand, contraction is possible on the coast,
even in territories of rocks and nearly barren sands, because
•there fishing largely makes up for the lack of land-produce,
because •the inhabitants have to cluster together order to
repel pirates, and further because •it is easier to get rid of
excess population by starting up colonies.
To these conditions for establishing a people there’s
another that must be added; it doesn’t take the place of
any of the others, but without it they are all useless. This
is the enjoyment of peace and plenty. ·The threat posed by
want or warfare is especially grave·, because when a state
11

2 10.

The people (further continued)

is initially getting itself in order it is least capable of offering
resistance and easiest to destroy. (A battalion that is in
process of forming up is vulnerable in the same way.) It
could resist better at a time of absolute chaos than at a
moment of ·politically creative· agitation, when everyone is
occupied with his own status and not with the danger. If
war, famine, or sedition breaks out at this time of crisis, the
state will inevitably be overthrown.
It’s true that many governments have been set up during
such storms; but in those cases it was the governments
themselves that destroyed the state. Usurpers always create
or select times of disturbance and public fear to get destructive laws passed—laws that the people would never have
adopted when they were thinking coolly. One of the surest
ways of distinguishing a legislator’s work from a tyrant’s is
through the question: When did he choose to act?
Then what people is a fit subject for legislation? One
•which is already held together by some unity of origin,
interest, or agreement, and has never yet felt the real
yoke of law;
•which doesn’t have deeply ingrained customs or
superstitions,
•which isn’t afraid of being overwhelmed by sudden
invasion,
•which, without entering into its neighbours’ quarrels,
can resist each of them unaided or can get the help of
one to repel another,
•in which each member can be known by every other,
and there is no need to lay on any man burdens too
heavy for a man to bear;
•which doesn’t need and isn’t needed by other
peoples,11

If there were two neighbouring peoples, one of which needed the other, it would be very hard on the one and very dangerous for the other. Every wise
nation, in such a case, would make it a priority to free the other from dependence. . . .

indeed rarely found united, which is why few states have

and that
•No citizen will ever be wealthy enough to buy another,
and none poor enough to be forced to sell himself12
—which implies, on the part of the great, no extremes of

ordinary folk no extremes of miserliness or greed.
They say that this equality is a theoretical pipe-dream
that can’t exist in practice. But ·even· if it is certain to be
abused, is that a reason for not at least making regulations
concerning it? It’s precisely because the forces at work in
the world always tend to destroy equality that the force of
legislation should always tend to maintain it.
But these general goals of any good constitution [see Glossary] need to be adapted in each country to the local situation
and the character of the inhabitants; it’s these that should
determine the particular institutional system that is best, not
perhaps in itself, but for the state in question. For example:
what if the soil is barren and unproductive, or the land too
crowded for its inhabitants? Then turn to industry and the
crafts, and exchange what they produce for the commodities
you lack. If on the other hand your territory is rich and
fertile, focus your efforts on labour-intensive agriculture,
and drive out the crafts that would only depopulate your
territories by clustering what few inhabitants you have in
a few towns.13 If you live on an extensive and manageable

11. Differences among systems of legislation
What precisely is the greatest good of all, the good that
should be the goal of every system of legislation? It comes
down to two main things: •liberty and •equality—liberty
because any constraint on one individual means that that
much force is taken from the body of the state, and equality
because liberty can’t exist without it.
I have already defined civil liberty. As for equality: we
should take this to mean not that the degrees of power and
riches are to be absolutely the same for everyone, but that
12

13

Do you want the state to be solid? Then make the wealth-spread as small as you can; don’t allow rich men or beggars. These two conditions are
naturally inseparable: ·any state that has very wealthy citizens will also have beggars, and vice versa·. And they are equally fatal to the common
good: one produces supporters of tyranny, the other produces tyrants. It is always between them that public liberty is put on sale: one buys, the
other sells.
‘Any branch of foreign commerce’, says the Marquis d’Argenson, ‘creates over-all only an apparent advantage for the kingdom in general; it may
enrich some individuals, or even some towns, but the nation as a whole gains nothing by it and the populace is no better off.’

coast-line, cover the sea with ships and develop trade and
navigation; your state will have a life that is brilliant and
short! If on your coast the sea washes nothing but almost
inaccessible rocks, settle for a primitive way of life based
on fish-eating; you’ll have a quieter life, perhaps a better
one, certainly a happier one. In short, every nation has,
along with principles that all nations have, something that
gives them a particular application in its case, and makes its
legislation strictly its own. Thus, among the Jews long ago
and more recently among the Arabs, the main thing has been
religion, among the Athenians literature, at Carthage and
Tyre commerce, at Rhodes shipping, at Sparta war, at Rome
virtue. The author of The Spirit of the Laws [Montesquieu] has
shown with many examples the skills the legislator uses in
directing the constitution in one or other of these directions.

If the whole thing is to be set in order—i.e. if the public thing
is to be put into the best possible shape—there are various
relations to be taken account of. [Rousseau used chose publique
= ‘public thing’ expecting his readers to know that the Latin for this is

There is the action of the complete
body upon itself, i.e. the relation of the whole to the whole,
of the sovereign to the state. This relation is composed of
the relations among the parts of the whole, as we shall see
in due course.
The laws that regulate this relation are called political
laws, and they deserve their name ‘fundamental laws’—if
they are well done. ·What does their quality have to do with
their status as fundamental? Well·, if for each state there’s
only one good way of organising things, the populace that
has found it should stick to it, ·which means that for them it
is fundamental·; but if the established organisation is bad,
why should laws that prevent it from being good be regarded
as fundamental? Actually a people is always in a position to
change its laws. Even if they are good laws? Yes; for if the
populace chooses to do itself harm, who can have a right to
stop it?
(2) Then there’s the relation of the members (a) to one
another or (b) to the body as a whole. There should be as
little as possible of (2a) and as much as possible of (2b). Each
citizen would then be perfectly independent of all the rest,
and at the same time very dependent on the city; and these
two results are brought about always by the same means,
because only (2b) the strength of the state can secure (2a)
the liberty of its members. From this second relation arise
civil laws.
(3) We may consider also a third kind of relation between
the individual and the law, the relation of •disobedience to
res publica = ‘republic’.] (1)

What makes the constitution of a state really solid and
lasting is its having a population whose members behave
so decently to one another that natural relations are always
in harmony with the laws, so that all the law does is, so
to speak, to assure, accompany and adjust those natural
relations. But if the legislator aims wrongly and adopts •a
principle other than •the one that is rooted in the nature of
things—
•his makes for servitude while the natural one makes

for liberty, or
•his makes for riches, while the other makes for

population-growth,
•his makes for peace, while the other makes for con-

—the laws will gradually lose their influence, the constitution
will alter, and the state will have no rest from trouble till it
is either destroyed or changed, and invincible nature has

Government in general

BOOK 3
for ·an individual· man. Here we have what is, in the state,
the rationale of government; it’s quite wrong to identify it
with the sovereign—it serves the sovereign .
Then what is government? An intermediate body set up
between the subjects and the sovereign to enable them to
communicate with one another; it’s job is to apply the laws
and to maintain civil and political liberty.
The members of this body are called ‘magistrates’ [see
Glossary] or ‘kings’, i.e. governors, and the body as a whole
has the name ‘prince’. Thus, those who claim that the act by
which a people puts itself under leaders is not a •contract
are quite right. It is simply a •commission, a •job, in which
the leaders—mere officials of the sovereign—exercise in its
name the power that it has lodged with them. The sovereign
can limit this power, modify it or take it back, just as it
wishes; because the alienation [see Glossary] of such a right is
incompatible with the nature of the social body, and contrary
to the goal of association.
So in my usage ‘government’ (or ‘supreme administration’)
names the legitimate exercise of the executive power, and
‘prince’ or ‘magistrate’ names the man or the body entrusted
with that administration.

Before speaking of the different forms of government, let us
try to fix the exact sense of the word ’government’, which
hasn’t yet been thoroughly explained.

1. Government in general
I warn you that this chapter requires careful reading, and
that I don’t have the skill to make myself clear to someone
who won’t attend.
Every free action is produced by two causes working
together: one is mental, namely the volition that determines
the act; the other is physical, namely the power that carries
the act out. When I walk towards something, it is necessary
•that I should will to go there and •that my feet should carry
me there. If a paralytic wills to run and an active man
doesn’t, they will both stay where they are. The body politic
has the same motive powers, which again divide into will
and force: will is called ‘legislative power’ and force is called
‘executive power’. Nothing is done, nothing should be done,
without the two of them acting together.
We have seen that the legislative power belongs to the
people and can’t belong anywhere else. But the principles I
have laid down make it easy to see that the executive power
can’t belong to the people as legislature or sovereign [see
Glossary], because it consists wholly of particular acts that
fall outside the scope of the law, and consequently of the
sovereign, whose acts must always be laws.
So the public force needs an agent of its own. . . .to •set it
to work under the direction of the general will, to •put the
state in touch with the sovereign, •to do for the collective
person something like what the union of soul and body does

[In the next couple of pages Rousseau uses technical terms from mathematics, in ways that are filtered out from the present version because
they are too hard to make clear here. (i) He is using the terms in senses
which they had then and don’t have now. (ii) He also exploits the ambiguities of words that have (or had) mathematical and non-mathematical
senses. (iii) It is pretty clear that these detours through mathematics—
even if they don’t deserve the mockery they have often attracted—don’t
really help us to understand Rousseau’s theories of politics.]

. . . .The (b) government gets from the (a) sovereign the
29

The Social Contract

orders it gives to the (c) people; and for the state to be
properly balanced there must be a steady relationship between the a-to-b relation and the b-to-c relation. If any
of these three terms were altered, the steady relationship
would instantly be destroyed. [Rousseau puts that in terms of the

3 1.

Government in general

will. . . ., the greater the repressive force should be. If the
government is to be a good one, it should be proportionately
stronger as the population is greater.
[Two remarks: (i) The ellipsis marks the place where Rousseau equates
the relation
particular wills—the general will
with the relation
mœurs—lois
[lois are laws; for mœurs see Glossary].

breakdown of a mathematical ratio; that is part of the detour discussed

If the (a) sovereign tries to govern, or the
(b) magistrate tries to give laws, or if the (c) subjects refuse to
obey, disorder takes the place of regularity, force and will no
longer act together, and the state is dissolved and falls into
despotism or anarchy. Lastly. . . ., there is also only one good
government possible for a state; but as the relations within a
people can change in countless ways, different governments
may be good for different peoples or even for a single people
at different times.
Trying to give some idea of the various relations that may
hold between these two terms (a) and (c), I shall take as an
example the numerical size of a population, which is the
most easily expressible.
Suppose the state is composed of ten thousand citizens.
The sovereign can only be considered collectively and as
a body; but each member, in his role as a subject, is
considered individually; so the sovereign is to the subject
as ten thousand to one, meaning that each member of
the state has as his share only a ten-thousandth part of
the sovereign authority, although he is wholly under that
authority’s control. If the population numbers a hundred
thousand, the condition of the subjects doesn’t change; each
of them is under the whole authority of the laws, while his
vote. . . .now has only a tenth as much influence in drawing
them up. Thus, the people-to-sovereign ratio increases with
the number of the citizens, from which this follows: The
larger the state, the less the liberty. . . .
Now, the larger the ratio of particular wills to the general
in the preceding note.]

(ii) What Rousseau wrote means ‘The smaller the ratio of particular
wills. . . .’, but that must have been a slip.]

On the other hand, the bigger the state the more temptations and chances the holders of the public authority have
for abusing their power; so the greater the force government
should have for keeping the people in hand, the greater the
force the sovereign should have keeping the government in
hand. I’m not talking about absolute amount-of-force, but
of the comparative amounts of force of the different parts of
the state.
This conceptual scheme of ratios of (a) the sovereign to
(b) the prince (·or government·) and of the prince to (c) the
people is not an arbitrary idea, but an inevitable consequence
of the nature of the body politic. . . . One thing we learn from
it is that there is no single unique and absolute form of
government, but rather as many governments differing in
nature as there are states differing in size.
In discussing this matter in terms of population-size, I
am merely taking an example; the ratios that I am basically
talking about are not measured by the number of men, but
quite generally by the amount of action, which is a combination of a multitude of causes. As for my briefly borrowing
terms from mathematics, let me say that I’m well aware that
moral quantities don’t allow of geometrical precision.
[At this point, Rousseau presents another mathematical flourish, and then pushes it aside:] Without wrestling
with this proliferation of ·technical· terms, let us settle
30

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

for ·something much simpler, namely· a view of (b) the
government as a new body within the state, distinct from (c)
the people and (a) the sovereign, and intermediate between
them.
Between the government and the state there is this
essential difference: the state exists in its own right, whereas
the government exists only through the sovereign. Thus
the prince’s dominant will is, or should be, nothing but the
general will or the law; his force is only the public force
concentrated in his hands, and the moment he tries to base
any absolute and independent act on his own authority, the
whole structure starts to come apart. Look at it this way: If
the prince came to have a particular will more active than
the sovereign’s, and employed the public force in his hands
in obedience to this particular will, there would in effect be
two sovereigns—one rightful and the other actual—and the
social union would evaporate instantly, and the body politic
would be dissolved.
However, for the government to have an existence and a
real life distinguishing it from the body of the state, and for
all its members to be able to act together towards the goal
for which it was set up, it must have a particular myself, a
sensibility shared among all its members, a force, a will of its
own, that causally favours its preservation. This existence
as a particular implies assemblies, councils, a power to
deliberate and make decisions about the rights, titles, and
privileges that are to belong exclusively to the prince, giving
to his office as magistrate honours that are proportional to
how arduous it is. It is difficult to organise things so that (b)
this subordinate whole fits into (c) the big whole in such a
way that in affirming it own constitution (b) doesn’t alter the
general constitution, and always distinguishes the particular
force it possesses, which is meant for it its preservation, from
the public force, which is the preservation of (c) the state;

3 2.

The source of governmental variety

and, in short, is always ready to sacrifice (b) the government
to (c) the people, and never to sacrifice the people to the
government.
Although the artificial body of (b) the government is the
work of (a) another artificial body, so that it has only a kind
of borrowed and subordinate life, this doesn’t prevent it from
being able to act more or less vigorously and quickly, or from
being in more or less robust health, so to speak. Finally,
without moving directly away from the goal for which it was
instituted, the government may deviate •somewhat from that
goal—•how much depends on how it is constituted.
From all these differences arise the various relations
that the government should have to the body of the state.
·The details of these relations· should vary with particular
contingent changes that the state undergoes; for it often
happens that an intrinsically excellent government becomes
dreadful because its relations to the body politic haven’t
changed in response to defects in the body politic.

2. The source of the variety among forms of
government
To set out the general cause of the above differences, we
have to distinguish •the government from •the prince, as we
earlier distinguished (c) the state from (a) the sovereign.
How many members the magistracy can have varies. I
said that the ratio of the subjects to the sovereign was greater
in proportion as the population was more numerous; and
by an obvious and clear analogy we can say the same of the
relation of the magistrates to the government.

31

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

Now, the total force of the government is always that of the
state, so it doesn’t vary; from which it follows that the more
of this force the government spends on its own members
the less it has left to employ on the whole people. Thus, the
more magistrates there are, the weaker the government is.
This principle is really basic, so we should do our best to get
clear about it.
In the person of the magistrate we can distinguish three
essentially different wills: (i) the private will of the individual,
tending only to his personal advantage; (ii) the common will
of the magistrates, which relates purely to the advantage
of the prince (call this ‘corporate will’, which is general in
relation to the government and particular in relation to the
state of which the government is a part); and (iii) the will
of the people, i.e. the sovereign will, which is general both
in relation to the state regarded as the whole, and to the
government regarded as a part of the whole.
In a perfect act of legislation, the individual or particular
will should be at zero; the government’s corporate will should
be thoroughly subordinate; and the general or sovereign will,
therefore, should always predominate and should be the sole
guide of all the rest.
It’s just a fact of nature that these different wills become
more active the more they are concentrated. Thus, the general will is always the weakest, the corporate will second, and
the individual will strongest of all: so that in the government
each member is first of all
•himself, ·answerable only to his own personal needs
and desires·, then
•a magistrate, ·answerable to the needs and duties of
the magistracy, the government·, and then
•a citizen, ·answerable to the needs of the state·
—in exactly the reverse order to what the social system
requires.

3 2.

The source of governmental variety

This granted, if the whole government is in the hands
of one man, his particular will is all of a piece with the
corporate will ·of the government·, so that the latter—·the
will of the government concentrated in a single man·—is at
its highest possible degree of intensity. But •how much force
a government employs depends on the •strength of its will,
and the absolute force of the government is invariable; so it
follows that the most active government is that of one man.
Suppose we go in the opposite direction, letting (a) the
legislative authority be (b) the government—i.e. giving the
role of (b) prince to (a) the sovereign—thereby turning (c)
all the citizens into magistrates: then (b) the corporate will,
being identified with (a) the general will, won’t have any more
activity than (a) does, leaving (c) the particular will as strong
as it can possibly be. Thus, the government, having always
the same absolute force, will be at the lowest point of its
relative force or activity.
These relations are beyond question, and other considerations still further confirm them. We can see, for instance,
that each magistrate is more active in the body to which he
belongs than each citizen is in the body to which he belongs,
and that consequently each particular will has much more
influence on the acts of the government than on those of
the sovereign; for each magistrate is almost always assigned
to some governmental function, whereas each citizen on
his own exercises no function of sovereignty. Furthermore,
the bigger the state grows, the more its real force increases,
though not in direct proportion to its increase in size; but
when the state remains the same, it won’t do the magistracy
any good to incease its numbers, because its force is that of
the state, i.e. stays the same. . . .
Also, it’s certain •that the more people are put in charge
of some project, the longer it takes to get it going; •that
in giving too much weight to prudence one doesn’t make
32

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

enough allowance for ·the possibility of good· luck; and •that
·with too many people involved· an opportunity may be let
slip so that all this deliberation results in the loss of the goal
that the deliberation was about.
I have just shown that the government becomes slack in
proportion to any increase in the number of magistrates; and
I showed earlier [page 30] that the more people there are, the
greater the repressive force needs to be. From this it follows
that the ratio of magistrates to the government should vary
inversely to the ratio of the subjects to the sovereign; which
means that the larger the state is the more the government
should shrink, so that the number of the rulers diminish in
proportion to the increase in the population.
I am here speaking of the government’s relative strength,
not of its legitimacy. The more numerous the magistracy, the
nearer the corporate will comes to the general will; whereas
under a single magistrate this same corporate will is, as I
said, nothing but a particular will. Thus, what is lost on one
side may be gained on the other, and the art of the legislator
is to know how to fix the point at which the government’s
•force and its •will, which are always in inverse proportion,
intersect in the relation that is best for the state.

3 3.

Classifying governments

(B) Or the sovereign may restrict the government to a
small number of citizens, so that the private citizens outnumber magistrates; and this is called aristocracy.
(C) Or the sovereign may concentrate the whole government in the hands of a single magistrate from whom all
the others—·i.e. all the other governmental officials·—hold
their power. This third form is the most usual, and is called
monarchy, or royal government.
Within each of these forms, or at least each of the first
two, there can be differences of degree, including very wide
ones. A democracy, for example, may include all the people
or be restricted to half of them. An aristocracy, in its turn,
may be restricted indefinitely from half the people down to
the smallest possible number. And even royalty is open to a
certain amount of sharing out: Sparta always had two kings,
as its constitution provided; and the Roman Empire had as
many as eight emperors at once, without any splitting up of
the Empire itself. Thus, each form of government passes into
the next at a certain point, and it emerges that those three
main headings cover as many possible forms of government
as the state has citizens.
There are even more: a government can be subdivided
along certain lines into parts that may be administered in
different ways from one another, so the combination of the
three forms may result in a multitude of mixed forms. . . .
There have always been fights about what the best form
of government is, ignoring the fact each form is in some
cases the best and in others the worst.
If in the different states the number of supreme magistrates ought to be in inverse ratio to the size of the population,
it follows immediately that democratic government suits
small states, aristocratic government those of middle size,
and monarchy great ones. But there are countless possible
circumstances that would provide exceptions.

3. Classifying governments
The preceding chapter showed why we distinguish the various kinds or forms of government in terms of how many
members they have; now we have to discover how this
division is made.
(A) The sovereign may put the government in the hands
of the whole people or of a majority of them, so that among
the citizens the magistrates outnumber the merely private
individuals. This form of government is called democracy.
33

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

4. Democracy

3 4.

Democracy

Besides, such a government requires so many conditions
that are hard to satisfy all at once! •A small state, where the
people can assemble easily and where it’s not hard for each
citizen to know all the rest; •simplicity of mœurs [see Glossary],
to prevent complexity and controversy in public affairs; •a
high degree of equality in rank and fortune, without which
equality of rights and authority can’t exist for long; and •little
or no luxury—for luxury either comes from riches or makes
them necessary. It corrupts both rich and poor, the rich
by having it and the poor by wanting it; it sells the country
to softness and vanity; it robs the state of all its citizens
by putting some of them into the service of the others and
putting all of them into the service of public opinion.
That’s why a famous writer [Montesquieu] has made virtue
the driving force of a republics; for none of these conditions
could exist without virtue. But that great thinker didn’t
make all the needed distinctions, and that led him often
to be inexact and sometimes to be obscure; he didn’t see
that because the sovereign authority is everywhere the
same, the same driving force should be at work in every
well-constituted state—more or less, it is true, depending on
the form of the government.
There is no ·other· government so subject to civil wars
and internal agitations as democratic or popular government,
because there is none that •has such a strong and continual
tendency to change to another form, or •that needs more
vigilance and courage for its maintenance as it is. It is in
a democratic system above all that the citizen should arm
himself with strength and constancy, and say every day of
his life what a virtuous Count Palatine said in the Polish
parliament: ‘I prefer liberty with danger to peace with slavery’
[Rousseau quotes this in Latin].
A population of gods could have a democratic government.
A government as perfect as that is not for men.

Whoever (a) makes a law knows better than anyone else how
it should be (b) interpreted and applied. It seems then that
the best possible constitution is one in which the (b) executive
and (a) legislative powers are united; but this very union
would make the government in certain respects inadequate,
because it runs together things that should be distinguished;
and the (b) prince and the (a) sovereign, being the same
person, amount to no more than an ungoverned government.
It isn’t good for (a) the person who makes the laws (b)
to execute them, or for the body of the people to move the
focus of its attention away from •general concerns towards
•particular objects. Nothing is more dangerous than the
influence of private interests in public affairs; it leads to
the corruption of the legislator, which is an even worse evil
than the abuse of the laws by the government; it makes a
substantial change in the state, and all reformation becomes
impossible. A people that would never misuse governmental
powers would never misuse independence; a people that
would always govern well wouldn’t need to be governed.
There never was and never will be a real democracy in
the strict sense of the word. It’s against the natural order
for the many to govern and the few to be governed. It is
unimaginable that the people should be continually in session dealing with public affairs, and obviously they couldn’t
set up commissions for that purpose without changing the
form of the administration.
In fact, I can confidently lay down as a principle that
when the work of government is shared out among several
tribunals, the less numerous ·of these· will eventually acquire the greatest authority, if only because it’s a natural
consequence of their ability to act quickly.

advantage that in it the government’s members are chosen.
In popular ·= democratic· government, all the citizens are
born magistrates; but in aristocracy the role of magistrate is
confined to a few, who are elected to that position.14 By this
means uprightness, understanding, experience and all other
claims to pre-eminence and public esteem become further
guarantees of wise government.
Moreover, •assemblies are more easily held, •affairs are
discussed better and done with more order and diligence,
and •the state’s credibility in the eyes of other states is better
maintained, by venerable senators than by a multitude that
is unknown or despised.
In brief, the best and most natural arrangement is for the
wisest to govern the multitude, when it is assured that they
will govern for its profit and not for their own. Don’t uselessly
add to the wheels and springs of the government mechanism,
getting thousands of men to do what a hundred picked men
can do better. [Rousseau’s next sentence is awkward and
unclear. Its gist is that with a smallish government there
will be a tendency for its interests to deflect its activities, so
that some of the executive power will come from that source
rather than from the wishes of the sovereign, i.e. the will of
the entire population.]
In what circumstances is aristocracy the best form of
government? Well, the state shouldn’t be so small, or the
people so simple and upright, that the execution of the laws
follows immediately from the public will, as it would in a
good democracy. Nor should the nation be so large that its
rulers—scattered in order to govern it—are able to play the
sovereign each in his own department, and make themselves
independent as a step towards becoming masters.

We have here two quite distinct moral persons, (b) the government and (a) the sovereign. So there are two general wills,
(a) one general in relation to all the citizens, (b) the other only
for the members of the administration. Thus, although the
government can regulate its internal workings as it pleases,
it can speak to the people only in the name of the sovereign,
i.e. of the people itself. This fact should not be forgotten.
The first societies were governed aristocratically. The
heads of families consulted with one another on public
affairs. The young had no problem giving way to the authority
of experience. [Rousseau points out that many labels for
political leaders began as words referring to age, for example
‘senator’. Then:] The savages of North America govern
themselves in this way even now, and their government
is admirable.
But to the extent that inequalities produced by the social set-up came to predominate over natural inequality,
riches or power were put before age, and aristocracy became
elective. Finally, when the father’s power was inherited by
his offspring, along with his goods, this gave the whole family
the status of ‘nobles’, thus making government hereditary—
and there came to be 20-year-old senators!
There are then three sorts of aristocracy—natural, elective
and hereditary. The first is only for simple peoples; the third
is the worst of all governments; the second is the best, and
is aristocracy properly so-called.
·Comparing aristocracy with democracy or popular government·: Besides the advantage that comes from keeping
the two powers distinct from one another, aristocracy has the

It matters greatly to have laws governing the form of the election of magistrates; for if that is left at the discretion of the prince the government will
slide into being an hereditary aristocracy, as happened in the republics of Venice and Berne. Thus Venice collapsed as a state, long ago; but the
republic of Berne is maintained through its senate’s great wisdom; it is an exception—one that is very honourable and very dangerous!

•the public force of the state, and
•the particular force of the government.

But although aristocracy doesn’t demand all the virtues
needed by popular government, it demands others that are
all its own; for instance, moderation on the part of the rich
and contentment on the part of the poor. ·Note that I am not
demanding the abolition of the rich/poor divide·, because it
seems that thorough-going equality would be out of place;
they didn’t have it even at Sparta.
If this form of government carries with it a certain inequality of fortune, that is a good thing because it lets the
administration of public affairs be entrusted to those who
are most able to give them their whole time, but not for
Aristotle’ reason, namely that the rich should always be put
first. On the contrary, it matters that an opposite choice
should occasionally teach the people that men’s merits are a
weightier reason for preference than their wealth.

All the springs of the machine are in the same hands, the
whole moves towards the same end; there are no conflicting
movements that could cancel one another out, and a small
input of effort produces a large output of action—indeed
we can’t imagine a kind of constitution with a better inputoutput ratio. Archimedes, seated quietly on the bank and
easily pulling a great vessel through the water ·with a long
lever·, represents for me a skilful monarch, governing vast
states from his study, moving everything while seeming,
himself, not to move.
No government is more vigorous than this, and also
there’s no government in which the particular will holds
more sway and more easily rules the other wills. It is indeed
true that ‘the whole moves towards a single end’, but the
end in question is not public happiness, and all the energy
of this administration is constantly being used to harm the
state.
Kings want to be absolute, and the distant cry comes
to them ‘The best way to do that is to be loved by your
people’. This is a fine maxim, and there’s even some truth
in it; but unfortunately the court will always make fun of it.
The power that comes from a people’s love is no doubt the
greatest; but it is precarious and conditional [= ‘vulnerable to
changes in circumstances’], and princes will never rest content
with it. The best kings want to be so placed that they can
be wicked if they want to, without losing their mastery. A
political sermoniser may tell them that, because the people’s
strength is their own, their chief interest is that the people
should be •prosperous, •numerous and •formidable; but
there’s no point in telling them this because they know very
well that it’s not true! Their first personal interest is that
the people should be •weak, •wretched, and •unable to resist

6. Monarchy
So far, we have considered the prince as a moral and collective person, unified by the force of the laws, and charged
by the state with holding and exercising the executive power.
Let us now consider this power when it is gathered into the
hands of one natural person, one real man, who alone has
the right to exercise it in accordance with the laws. Such a
person is called a ‘monarch’ or ‘king’.
Whereas in some forms of administration a collective
being represents an individual, in this one an individual
represents a collective being; so that the moral unity that
constitutes the prince is at the same time a physical unity,
and all the qualities that in the other case are laboriously
brought together •by the law are here •naturally united.
Thus one single motive power generates
•the will of the people,
•the will of the prince,

them. I admit that the prince’s interest would indeed be that
his people should be powerful, so that its power, being his
own, would make him formidable to his neighbours—that
would be in his interests provided he could still keep his
subjects in submission. But strength is incompatible with
submission, so a prince has to choose; and he naturally gives
the preference to the principle that is more to his immediate
advantage. That is what Samuel put strongly before the
Hebrews [1 Samuel 8:10–18], and what Machiavelli has clearly
shown. While pretending to teach kings, he was really giving
extensive lessons to the people. His The Prince is the book of
Republicans.15

Monarchy

[In that passage, ‘dukes’ mistranslates Rousseau’s princes. In using that
word there, he was unwisely sliding from his usual use of prince to stand
for whatever person or group governs the state to its more ordinary sense
in which it is the label not for a function but for a rank.]

But if it is hard for a big state to be well governed, it’s
much harder still for it to be well governed by one man; and
everyone knows what happens when kings substitute others
for themselves!
Monarchical government has an essential and inevitable
defect that will always put it below republican government,
namely:
Whereas in a republic the public voice hardly ever
raises to the highest positions men who aren’t enlightened and capable, men who will fill those positions
honourably, in monarchies those who rise to the
top are most often merely little muddle-heads, little
crooks, little intriguers, whose little talents •get them
into the highest positions at court and then, once they
are there, •reveal to the public how incompetent they
are. The populace is far less often mistaken in this
choice than the prince is; and a man of real worth
among the ·king’s· ministers is almost as rare as a
fool at the head of a republican government! Thus,
when, by good luck one of these born governors takes
the helm of the state in some monarchy that has been
nearly ruined by those swarms of elegant and socially
presentable administrators, there is amazement at
the resources he discovers, and this marks an era in
his country’s history.

We have found, from general reasons concerning relations
between different states, that monarchy is suitable only for
great states, and this will be confirmed when we examine
monarchy in itself. The more people there are in the public
administration, the nearer the prince-to-subjects ratio comes
to equality, so that in democracy—·where every member
of the populace has a role in the government·—the ratio
is 1:1, or absolute equality. And when the government is
progressively restricted in numbers the ratio becomes steeper
and reaches its maximum when the government is in the
hands of a single person, ·so that the ratio is 1:n where n =
the size of the population·. In that case, therefore, there’s
too much distance between prince and people, and the state
isn’t properly held together. To bind it there would have to
be intermediate orders—dukes, grandees, nobles—to fill the
space between the prince and the people. But none of that
suits a small state, to which all class differences mean ruin.

Machiavelli was an honest man and a good citizen; but, being attached to the court of the Medici, he had to veil his love of liberty in the midst of
his country’s oppression. The choice of his detestable hero, ·Cesare Borgia·, clearly enough shows his hidden aim; and the contradiction between
the teaching of The Prince and that of the Discourses on Livy and the History of Florence shows that this profound political thinker has so far been
studied only by superficial or corrupt readers. The court of Rome sternly prohibited his book—of course it did! because that’s the court that the book
most clearly portrays.

Monarchy

part ·of the kingdom·, and peace enjoyed in this way under
a king is worse than the disorders of an interregnum [i.e. a
period between two kings].
What has been done to prevent these evils? Crowns
have been made hereditary in certain families, and an order
of succession has been set up, to prevent disputes from
arising when kings die. That is to say, the disadvantages of
regency [= ‘having a stand-in for the king’] have been put in place
of the disadvantages of choice; apparent tranquility has been
preferred to wise government; and men have preferred •the
risk of having children, monstrosities, or imbeciles as rulers
to •having disputes over the choice of good kings. It hasn’t
been taken into account that in thus exposing ourselves to
that risk we are loading the dice against ourselves. There
was sound sense in what the younger Dionysius said to his
father, who reproached him for doing some shameful deed
by asking, ‘Did I set you the example?’ ‘Ah,’ answered his
son, ‘your father wasn’t a king.’ [He meant: ‘Your moral education

[Notice that the defect of monarchy that Rousseau first called ’essential
and inevitable’ has turned out to be a defect of which monarchies are
‘hardly ever’ free.]

For a monarchical state to have a chance of being well
governed, its population and geographical size must be
suitable for the abilities of its governor. It is easier to
•conquer than to •rule. With a long enough lever, the world
could be •moved with a single finger; •holding it up needs the
shoulders of Hercules. However small a state is, the prince is
nearly always too small for it. And when on the other hand a
state is too small for its ruler (this doesn’t happen often!), it
is still badly governed. That’s because the ruler, constantly
pursuing his great plans, forgets his people’s interests and
makes them as wretched by •misusing the talents he has
as a more limited ruler would make them because of •the
lack of the talents he didn’t have. A kingdom should expand
or contract, so to speak, with each reign, according to the
how able each prince is; whereas ·in a republican system·
the abilities of a senate are more constant, so that the state
can have permanent frontiers without the administration
suffering.
The disadvantage that is most felt in monarchical government is the lack of any such continuous succession
as both the other forms ·of government, democracy and
aristocracy· have to provide an unbroken bond of union.
A king dies, another is needed; elections leave dangerous
gaps and are full of storms; and unless the citizens are
disinterested [= not self -interested’] and upright to a degree that
very seldom goes with this kind of government, intrigue and
corruption abound. Someone to whom the state has sold
itself can hardly help selling it in his turn and getting back,
at the expense of the weak, the money the powerful have
extorted from him ·as their price for the throne·. Under such
an administration, greed for money spreads through every

this chapter.]

When a man is set in authority over others, everything
conspires to rob him of his sense of justice and reason. Much
trouble, we’re told, is taken to teach young princes the art
of •reigning; but it doesn’t seem to do them much good. It
would be better to begin by teaching them the art of •obeying.
The greatest kings celebrated in history were not brought
up to reign: reigning is a science that a man is never so
far from having at his command as when he has learned
too much of it—a science that he would acquire better by
obeying than by commanding. ‘The best and shortest way to
find out what is good and what is bad is to consider what you
would have wanted to happen or not to happen if someone
else had been Emperor’ (Tacitus, Histories, i. 16) [Rousseau
quotes this in Latin].
38

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

One result of this lack of cohesion is the inconstancy of
royal government; regulated now on this scheme and now
on that, according to the character of the reigning prince or
those who reign for him, such a government can’t for long
have a fixed objective or a consistent policy; it will always be
shifting from slogan to slogan and from project to project—a
variability that isn’t found in the other forms of government,
where the prince [see Glossary] is always the same. So we find
that in general if a ·monarchical· court has more plotting,
a senate has more wisdom, and republics advance towards
their ends by more consistent and better considered policies;
whereas every change of minister under a monarch creates a
revolution in the state, because the principle that is adopted
by all ministers and nearly all kings is to do in everything
the reverse of what their predecessors did.
. . . .Royalist political writing likens civil government to
domestic government, and the prince to the father of a
family—this error has already been refuted—and also lavishly
credits the prince with having all the virtues that it would
be useful to him to have, and steadily supposes him to be
what he ought to be. With the help of this supposition, it
is easy to make out that royal government is preferable to
all others, because it is unquestionably the •strongest; and
in addition to that, all it needs to be the •best—·needs but
doesn’t have·—is a corporate will that is more in conformity
with the general will.
But if Plato is right when he says in The Statesman that a
‘king by nature’ is a rarity, how often will nature and fortune
work together to give him a crown? And, if royal education
inevitably corrupts those who receive it, what can we hope
to get from a series of men brought up to reign? Someone
who confuses •royal government with •government by a good
king is willfully deceiving himself. To see royal government
as it is in itself, we must look at it under princes who are

3 7.

Mixed governments

incompetent or wicked; for either they will be like that when
they come to the throne or the throne will make them so.
Our writers know all this, but aren’t troubled by it. The
remedy, they say, is to obey without a murmur: God angrily
sends bad kings, who must be endured as the scourges of
heaven. Improving talk, no doubt; but wouldn’t it be more
in place in a pulpit than in a book on politics? What are we
to say about a physician who promises miracles, and whose
whole treatment is to urge the sufferer to be patient? When
there’s bad government we must put up with it—we know
that already! The question is how to find a good one.

7. Mixed governments
Strictly speaking, there’s no such thing as a simple ·or unmixed· government. An isolated ruler must have subordinate
magistrates; a popular government must have a head. In
the distribution of the executive power, therefore, there is
always a gradation from larger to smaller numbers, with this
variation: sometimes the greater number depends on the
smaller, and sometimes it’s the other way around.
Sometimes the distribution is equal: •the constituent
parts are in mutual dependence, as in the government of
England, or •the authority of each part of the government
is independent, but incomplete—·part x has some authority,
part y has some, and neither comes under the other·. This
last form is bad because there’s no unity in the government,
and the state has nothing to hold it together.
Which is better, a simple government or a mixed one?
Political writers are always debating this question, which
should be answered in the same way that I earlier answered
·the corresponding question· about all forms of government.
Simple government is better in itself, just because it
is simple. But when the executive power isn’t sufficiently
39

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

dependent upon the legislative power, i.e. when the prince
pushes harder on the sovereign than the people push on the
prince, this imbalance should be cured by dividing the government; for all the parts still have as much authority over
the subjects, while their division makes them all together
less strong against the sovereign.
That same disadvantage is also prevented by the appointment of intermediate magistrates; that leaves the government undivided, and merely balances the two powers—·i.e.
the government and the sovereign·—and maintains their
respective rights. This is moderated government, not mixed
government.
There’s a similar cure for the opposite disadvantage: when
the government is too slack, set up tribunals to make it
pull itself together. That’s what all the democracies do.
In the first situation the government is divided to make
it weak; in the second it is divided to make it strong; for the
maxima of both strength and weakness are found in simple
governments, while the mixed forms provide intermediate
amounts of strength.

3 8.

No one form of government. . .

The amount of this excess isn’t the same in all countries.
In some it is considerable, in others middling, in yet others nil, in some even negative. This ·earned:needed· ratio
depends on the fertility of the climate, on the kind of work
the land demands, on the nature of its products, on the
strength of its inhabitants, on how much or little they need
to consume, and on other factors that also contribute to the
over-all ratio.
On the other side ·of the ratio·, governments aren’t all
of the same nature: some are less voracious than others,
and the differences between them are based on this second
principle, that the further the public contributions are from
their source, the more burdensome they are. That burden
shouldn’t be measured by the amount of money involved,
but by the distance it has to travel in order to get back to
those who paid it. When the circulation is fast and secure,
it doesn’t matter whether the amount is small or large; the
populace is always rich and finances are always in good
shape. In the opposite situation, however little the people
gives, if that little doesn’t get back to it then it is constantly
giving, and before long it is exhausted; and in that case the
state is never rich and the populace is always a beggar.
It follows that the greater the distance between people
and government the more burdensome the taxes are: the
people carry the lightest burden in a democracy, a heavier
one in an aristocracy, and the heaviest in a monarchy. Thus,
monarchy suits only wealthy nations, aristocracy suits ones
of middling size and wealth, and democracy suits states that
are small and poor.
In fact, the more you think about this the more you’ll see
it as a difference between free states and monarchies. In free
states everything is used for the public advantage; in the
others, there’s an interplay between the public forces and
those of individuals, and as either of them weakens the other

8. No one form of government suits all countries
Liberty isn’t a fruit of every climate, so it isn’t within the reach
of every people. The more you think about this principle that
Montesquieu laid down, the more you feel its truth; and the
more you fight it, the more evidence you find in its favour.
In all the governments in the world the public person consumes without producing. Then where does it get the stuff
it consumes? From the labour of its members. The public’s
necessities are supplied out of the individuals’ surpluses. It
follows that the civil state can survive only so long as men’s
labour brings them a return greater than their needs.

grows strong. In a nutshell: instead of governing subjects to
make them happy, despotism makes them wretched in order
to govern them.
Thus, in every climate there are natural causes that
determine which form of government would be best for it;
and we can even say what sort of inhabitants would be best
for it.
Harsh and barren lands where the product isn’t worth the
labour should remain desert and uncultivated, or occupied
only by savages; lands where men’s labour brings in precisely
the bare minimum needed for survival should be inhabited by
barbarous peoples: no political structure is possible in such
places; lands where there’s a middling surplus of product
over labour are suitable for free peoples; ones where the
soil is abundant and fertile and yields a large product for
a little labour call for monarchical government, so that the
excessive surpluses among the subjects may be consumed
by the luxury of the prince: for it’s better for this excess to
be absorbed by the government than scattered among the
individuals. Yes, I know that there are exceptions; but these
exceptions themselves confirm the rule, because sooner or
later they produce revolutions that restore things to the
natural order.
Let us never confuse general laws with particular causes
that might modify the effects of a law. If all the south
were covered with republics and all the north with despotic
states, it would still be true that. . . .despotism is suitable
to hot countries, barbarism to cold ones, and good polity
to temperate regions. I see also that people who all accept
the principle may disagree about its application; someone
might say that some cold countries are very fertile, and
some tropical ones are barren. But someone who thinks
this is a difficulty ·for my position· hasn’t looked into this
matter thoroughly enough. I repeat, we have to take labour,

3 8.

No one form of government. . .

strength, consumption etc. into account.
·To get an idea of what I am talking about·, consider this
example:
•Two stretches of territory x and y, each has an area of
a hundred square miles;
•x brings in five ·loads of corn· and y brings in ten;
•the inhabitants of x consume the equivalent of four
loads of corn, while the inhabitants of y consume
nine.
Here the amount of surplus is the same, but the ratios of
surplus to product are different: in x the surplus is a fifth of
the total, in y it is a tenth. . . .
There’s no question of x’s having twice the product that y
has; and I don’t think anyone would maintain that in general
cold countries are as fertile as hot ones. But suppose that
that is how things stand: England is on the same level of
fertility as Sicily, and Poland as Egypt—further south we’ll
have Africa and the Indies; further north, nothing at all. To
get this equality of product, what a difference there must be
in farming practices! In Sicily they need only to scratch the
ground, whereas in England, how men must toil! And where
more hands are needed to get the same product, the surplus
must be less.
Bear in mind also that men consume much less in hot
countries. To stay healthy in those climes one must eat and
drink frugally; Europeans who try to live there as they would
at home all die of dysentery and indigestion. Chardin writes:
‘We are carnivorous animals, wolves, in comparison
with the Asians. Some attribute the Persians’ frugality to their country’s being less cultivated; but I
think that that’s back to front, and that really their
country is less well supplied with foodstuffs because
the inhabitants need less. If their frugality were an
effect of the land’s poverty, only the poor would eat

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

3 8.

No one form of government. . .

little; whereas in fact everyone there eats little. Again
the consumption level would differ in the different
provinces, according to the fertility of their land,
whereas in fact the same frugality with food and drink
occurs throughout the kingdom. [Plus some remarks
about diet in relation to skin-colour.]
The nearer you get to the equator, the less people live on.
Meat they hardly touch; rice, maize, couscous, millet and
cassava are their standard diet. There are millions of men
in the Indies whose food-intake costs less than a halfpenny
a day. Even in Europe we see considerable differences of
appetite between northern and southern peoples: a Spaniard
will live for a week on a German’s dinner. . . .
Luxury in clothes shows similar differences. In climates
where the seasons are fast and big, men have better and
simpler clothes; in lands where they dress only for adornment, they care more about what is striking than about
what is useful; clothes themselves are then a luxury. In
Naples you can see. . . .men in gold-embroidered vests and
no leg-coverings. It is the same with buildings; magnificence
is all that matters when there’s nothing to fear from the air.
In Paris and London, you want to be lodged warmly and
comfortably; Madrid has superb salons but no windows that
close, and you go to bed in a mere hole.
In hot countries foods are much more substantial and
more tasty, and this third difference is bound to have an
influence on the second. [He means: an influence on how much

that the wheat of Barbary, in other respects inferior to that
of France, yields much more flour, and that France’s wheat
in turn yields more than wheat in northern countries; from
which it’s a fair inference that this gradation ·in wheat-yield·
holds generally, from equator to pole, is found generally. Well,
now, isn’t it an obvious disadvantage for an equal ·amount
of· product to contain less nourishment?
A further difference ·between hot and cold countries·
arises from the previous differences and also strengthens
them, namely:
Hot countries have less need of inhabitants than cold
ones do, and can support more of them.
There is thus a double surplus—·more product, fewer
consumers·—which is all to the advantage of despotism.
(i) For any fixed number of inhabitants, the more they are
geographically spread out the harder it becomes for them to
revolt, because ·would-be revolutionaries· can’t act together
quickly or secretly: the government can easily unmask their
activities ·thus defeating secrecy·, and cut communications
·thus defeating co-ordination among the revolutionary cells·.
On the other hand, (ii) the more geographically concentrated
a population is, the harder it is for the government to usurp
the sovereign’s place: the people’s leaders can deliberate as
safely in their houses as the prince can in council, and the
crowd gathers as rapidly in the town squares as the prince’s
troops do in their barracks.

[Although his terminology differs a little, Rousseau is presenting (i) and

differences.] Why are so many vegetables eaten in Italy?
Because there they are good, nutritious and excellent in taste.
In France, where vegetables are nourished only on water,
they don’t provide nourishment and are hardly listed on
menus. They don’t take up less ground ·than in the south·,
and are at least as much trouble to grow. It is a proved fact

and the geographical concentration encourages, is action by the people
(the people’s leaders, the planners of revolt, the would-be revolutionaries)
against attempts by the government to usurp the powers of sovereignty,
thus becoming despotic.]

So a tyrannical government does best when acting at great
distances. With the help of the rallying-points it establishes,
42

The Social Contract

its strength grows with distance like that of a lever.16 The
people’s strength, on the other hand, acts only when concentrated: when it is spread around it evaporates and is
lost, like gunpowder powder scattered on the ground, which
·doesn’t explode but· only catches fire grain by grain. The
least populous countries are thus the fittest for tyranny:
fierce animals reign only in deserts.

The signs of a good government

be ignored;
•some are content as long as money circulates, others

demand that the people have bread.
Even if we reached agreement on points like these, would
that be any sort of progress? Moral qualities can’t be
measured exactly, so agreement about •the signs of good
government could still leave us disagreeing about •which
actual governments are good ones.
I am continually astonished that such a simple sign
·of good government· isn’t recognised, or perhaps men do
recognise it but aren’t honest enough to say so. What is
the purpose of any political association? The preservation
and prosperity of its members. And what is the surest
sign of their preservation and prosperity? Their number
and their population·-growth·. That’s the sign you are
looking for. Other things being equal, the unquestionably
best government is the one under which the population
increases most, without external help from naturalising
foreigners or establishing colonies. The government under
which the population shrinks is the worst. Over to you,
Calculators—count, measure, compare!

9. The signs of a good government
So if someone asks ‘What is, over-all, the best government?’
he has to be told that the question is unanswerable as well
as being indeterminate; or you could say that it has as
many good answers as there are possible combinations in
the absolute and relative situations of all nations.
‘Well, by what sign can we tell whether a given people is
well or badly governed?’—that’s a question of fact that does
have an answer.
But we don’t have the answer to it, because everyone
wants to answer it in his own way:
•Subjects praise public tranquility, citizens praise individual liberty;
•some prefer security of possessions, others security
of the person;
•some hold that the best government is the most severe,
others that it is the mildest;
•some want crimes punished, others want them prevented;
•some want the state to be feared by its neighbours,
others prefers that it should ·keep a low profile and·

That should also be the basis for deciding which centuries
have been the best for human prosperity. There has been
too much admiration for the times when arts and letters
flourished, by people who didn’t see the hidden object of their
culture, and didn’t take into account its fatal effect. ‘What
ignorant people called “civilized culture’ was really an aspect
of slavery’ (Tacitus, Agricola, 31). Will we ever see in the
maxims of any book a statement of the vulgar interest that

This doesn’t contradict what I said earlier [page 23] about the disadvantages of great states. The topic back there was the government’s authority
over its members, whereas the present topic is its force against the subjects. Its scattered members serve it as fulcrums for action at a distance ·by
leverage· against the people; but the government has no fulcrum for direct action on its own members. Thus for the government the length of the
lever is a weakness for one purpose and a strength for the other.

motivates the author? No! Whatever they say, when despite
its renown a country is losing population it’s not true that all
is well there; a poet may have an income of 100,000 francs for
saying that his age is the best of all, but that doesn’t change
anything. Less attention should be paid to •the apparent
peace and tranquility of the rulers than to •the well-being
of whole nations and especially those with the largest populations. A hail-storm lays several cantons to waste, but it
doesn’t often create a famine. Outbreaks and civil wars scare
rulers, but they aren’t the real misfortunes of peoples, who
can even relax a little while there’s a dispute going on about
who shall tyrannise over them. Their real prosperities and
calamities come from their permanent condition: it’s when
the whole remains crushed beneath the yoke that the whole
falls into decay. That is when the rulers destroy them at
will, and ‘Where they create a waste-land, they call it peace’
(Tacitus, Agricola 31) [Rousseau quotes Tacitus each time in Latin].
When the troubles among the great disturbed the kingdom
of France, and the Assistant Bishop of Paris went to the
Parliament with a dagger in his pocket, these things didn’t
prevent the people of France from prospering and multiplying
in dignity, in free and honourable ease. There was a time
when Greece flourished in the midst of the most savage wars;
blood ran in torrents, yet the whole country was covered
with inhabitants. It appeared, says Machiavelli, that in the
midst of murder, proscription and civil war, our republic did

Abuse and degeneration of government

did more to strengthen it than all its dissensions had done
to weaken it. A little disturbance energizes the soul; what
makes our species truly prosperous is not so much peace as
liberty.

10. How government is abused. Its tendency to
degenerate
Just as the individual will is constantly acting in opposition
to the general will, so the government is continually exerting
itself against the sovereignty. The more strenuously it does
this, the more the constitution changes; and because in
this situation there’s no other corporate will to create an
equilibrium by resisting the will of the prince, eventually the
prince will bear down hard on the sovereign and break the
social treaty. [Remember that ‘the prince’ = ‘the government’, and ‘the
sovereign’ = ‘the general will’.] This is the inherent and inevitable
defect which, from the very birth of the body politic, tends
ceaselessly to destroy it, as age and death eventually destroy
the human body.
How does a government degenerate? There are two basic
ways: •it shrinks, or •the state is dissolved.
A government contracts when it changes from the many
to the few, i.e. from democracy to aristocracy, and from
aristocracy to monarchy. It has a natural tendency to move
in that direction.17 If a government took the reverse course

The slow formation and the development of the Republic of Venice in its lagoons are a notable instance of this sequence; and it is most astonishing
that after more than twelve hundred years’ the Venetians seem to be still at the second stage, which they reached with the closing down of the
Great Council in 1198. . . . Opponents of my view are sure to cite the Roman Republic, which they will say followed exactly the opposite course,
going from monarchy to aristocracy and then to democracy. I don’t look at it in anything like that way. What Romulus first set up was a mixed
government, which soon deteriorated into despotism. From special causes, that state died an untimely death, as new-born children sometimes die
without reaching manhood. The real birth of the Roman republic dates from the expulsion of the Tarquins; but at that time it didn’t have a constant
form because the job was only half-done: they didn’t abolish the nobility. In that way hereditary aristocracy—the worst of all legitimate forms of
administration—remained in conflict with democracy, and the form of the government was free-floating and uncertain. It didn’t get fixed until this

from the few to the many, it could be said to be relaxing; but
this reverse sequence is impossible.
Indeed, a government won’t change its form unless its
unwound spring leaves it too weak to keep the form that
it has. If a government relaxed while extending its sphere,
its force would become absolutely nil, and it would be even
further from being able to survive. So ·when this starts to
happen· it is necessary to go back and wind up the spring to
get rid of the slack; otherwise the state that it sustains will
come to grief.

Abuse and degeneration of government

contract, but the state does; I mean that the great big state
is dissolved, and another state is formed within it, •composed
solely of the members of the government and •relating to
the rest of the people as their master and tyrant. Thus, the
moment the government usurps the sovereignty, the social
compact is broken, and all private citizens recover by right
their natural liberty; they are forced to obey, but they have
no obligation to do so.
(2) When the members of the government individually
usurp the power they should exercise only as a body. This is
as great an infraction of the laws, and results in even greater
disorders. When this happens there are as many princes as
there are magistrates, so to speak, and the state, which is
as divided as the government is, either perishes or changes
its form.
When the state is dissolved, the abuse of government,
whatever it is, bears the common name of ‘anarchy’. . . .,
democracy degenerates into ochlocracy [= ‘mob rule’], and
aristocracy degenerates into oligarchy. I would add that
royalty degenerates into tyranny, but ‘tyranny’ is ambiguous
and needs explanation.
In the everyday sense of the word, a tyrant is a king
who governs with the help of violence and without regard

[In the preceding two paragraphs, Rousseau has spoken of a government’s (i) contracting or relaxing (= ‘expanding’), and then of its (ii) being
wound up tight or coming unwound. He uses the same French verbs
for each of these contrasts. Are these meant to be a single contrast?
Well, in the first contrast a government se resserre by becoming smaller,
involving fewer people, whereas in the second contrast you resserre a
government by winding up its spring. Those are not obviously equivalent, but read on.]

The dissolution of the state can come about in either of
two ways.
(1) When the prince stops governing the state in accordance with the laws, and usurps the sovereign power. Then
something remarkable happens: the government doesn’t

was achieved by the establishment of the system of tribunes (Machiavelli has proved this); only then was there a true government and a veritable
democracy. In fact, the populace was then not only sovereign, but also magistrate and judge; the senate was only a subordinate tribunal, to moderate
the government and give it focus; and even the consuls—though they were of the nobility, chief magistrates, absolute generals in war—were in Rome
itself no more than the populace’s chairmen [French présidents]. From then onwards the government followed its natural tendency, inclining strongly
towards aristocracy. The nobility abolished itself, as it were, and the aristocracy was found no longer
in the body of the hereditary nobility, as at Venice and Genoa, but
in the body of the senate, which was composed of nobles and commoners, and even
in the body of tribunes when they began to usurp an active function.
(Don’t let the labels get in the way of your thinking about the facts. When the people has rulers who govern for it, the government is an aristocracy,
whatever label is put on its members.) The abuse of aristocracy led to the civil wars and the triumvirate. Sulla, Julius Caesar and Augustus became
in fact real monarchs; and finally, under the despotism of Tiberius the state was dissolved. So Roman history doesn’t invalidate the principle I have
laid down; it confirms it!

for justice and the laws. In the word’s precise sense, a
tyrant is an individual who grabs the royal authority without
having any right to it. That is how the Greeks understood
the word ‘tyrant’: they applied it even-handedly to good and
bad princes whose authority wasn’t legitimate. . . . ‘Tyrant’
and ‘usurper’ are thus perfectly synonymous terms.
So as to have different labels for different things, I call
someone who usurps the royal authority a tyrant, and him
who usurps the sovereign power a despot. The tyrant is
someone who illegally forces his way in, so as to govern in
accordance with the laws; the despot is someone who sets
himself above even the laws. Thus the tyrant needn’t be a
despot, but the despot is always a tyrant.

Maintaining sovereign authority

will end later than any other, unless some unforeseen event
brings about its premature destruction.
The body politic’s source of life lies in the sovereign
authority. The legislative power is the state’s •heart, and
the executive power is its •brain, which puts the parts into
motion. It can happen that the brain becomes paralysed
while the individual still lives. A man can be an imbecile
while staying alive. But as soon as the heart ceases to
perform its functions, the animal body is dead.
What keeps the state alive is not •the laws but •the
legislative power. Yesterday’s law is not binding to-day; but
tacit consent is inferred from silence; and when there’s a law
that •the sovereign could abrogate but doesn’t, •it is held
to be continuously confirming it. Anything that it has ever
declared itself to will it wills always unless it says otherwise.
That’s why so much respect is paid to old laws. We
should accept that nothing could have preserved them for
so long but their own excellence; if the sovereign hadn’t
recognised them as salutary, it would have cancelled them
a thousand times. So in any well constituted state the laws
continually grow (not weaker from old age, but) stronger. . . .
And wherever the laws grow weak as they age, this shows
•that there is no longer a legislative power, and that •the
state is dead.

11. The death of the body politic
Death is the natural and inevitable tendency of the best
constituted governments. If Sparta and Rome perished, what
state can hope to last for ever? If we want to establish a
long-lived form of government, let us not even dream of
making it eternal! If we’re to succeed, we mustn’t attempt
the impossible, or flatter ourselves that we are endowing the
work of man with a stability that the human condition is not
in fact capable of.
The body politic, like the human body, begins to die as
soon as it is born, and carries in itself the causes of its
destruction. But in each case the life-span may be longer or
shorter, depending on whether the constitution is more or
less robust. Man’s constitution is the work of •nature; the
state’s constitution is the work of •art, ·i.e. it is man-made,
artificial, not natural·. It isn’t in men’s power to prolong
their own lives; but it’s up to them to give the state as long
a life as possible by giving it the best possible constitution.
Even the best constituted state will come to an end; but it

12. How the sovereign authority is maintained
The sovereign, having no force except the legislative power,
acts only through the laws; and because the laws are just
the authentic acts of the general will, the sovereign can’t act
except when the populace is assembled. ‘The populace in
assembly—what a fantasy!’ you’ll want to say. It is so today,
but 2000 years ago it wasn’t. Has man’s nature changed?
The bounds of human possibility are not as confining as
46

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

we think they are; they are made to ·seem to· be tight by
our weaknesses, our vices, our prejudices that confine them.
Low-grade souls have no belief in great men; vile slaves grin
mockingly at the name of liberty.
Let’s think about what can be done, remembering what
has been done. I shan’t discuss the ancient Greek republics;
but the Roman republic strikes me as having been a great
state, and the town of Rome a great town. The last census
reported that Rome had four hundred thousand citizens
capable of bearing arms, and the last statement of the
population of the Empire showed over four million citizens—
and that’s not including subject peoples, foreigners, women,
children or slaves.
Frequent assembling of the vast population of this capital
and its neighbourhood—what a labour that must have been!
Yet the Roman people did assemble almost weekly and sometimes even more often. The populace exercised the rights
of sovereignty and also some of the rights of government.
It transacted some business and judged some cases; and
·the members of· this whole population were in the public
meeting-place as •magistrates almost as often as they were
there as •citizens.
If we went back to the earliest history of nations, we
would find that most of the ancient governments—even
those of monarchical form, such as the Macedonian and the
Frankish—had similar councils. Be that as it may, the one
unquestionable fact that I have presented ·about assemblies
in Rome· is an answer to all difficulties. ‘Something exists,
so it is possible’—that looks to me like good logic.

3 13.

Maintaining sovereign authority

•fixed the state’s constitution on one occasion by giving

its assent to a body of laws; or to have
•set up a perpetual government, or to have
•provided once for all for the election of magistrates.
There must also be fixed periodical assemblies that can’t
be cancelled or postponed, so that on the proper day the
populace is legitimately called together by law, without any
need for a formal summoning. (This is additional to any
special assemblies that may be required in emergencies.)
But apart from these assemblies authorised by their
date alone, every assembly of the people not summoned
by magistrates appointed for that purpose, in accordance
with the prescribed forms, should be regarded as illegitimate,
and all its acts as null and void, because the law has to be
the source of the command to assemble.
How often should these lawful assemblies occur? That
depends on so many considerations that exact rules for it
can’t be given. Still, one can say in general that the stronger
a government is the more need there is for the sovereign to
show itself often ·in assemblies of the people·.
‘This may be all right for a single town,’ you’ll want to
say, ‘but what if the state includes several towns? (i) Is the
sovereign authority to be divided? (ii) or concentrated in a
single town to which all the rest are made subject?’ Neither of
those, I reply. (i) The sovereign authority is one and doesn’t
have parts; so it can’t be divided without being destroyed.
(ii) And one town can’t legitimately be made subject to
another, any more than one nation can; because the essence
of the body politic lies in the harmony of •obedience with
•liberty, and the words ‘subject’ and ‘sovereign’ are precisely
complementary, the concepts being united in the single word
‘citizen’.
I reply also that it’s always bad to unify several towns in
a single city, and that anyone wanting to do this had better

it was they represented. Most of the tumults that arose in
the comitia in Rome were due to ignorance or neglect of this
rule. [Re comitia: see page 61.] The consuls were in them merely
the people’s chairmen; the tribunes were mere speakers;18
the senate was nothing at all.
These intervals of suspension during which the prince
recognises or ought to recognise an actual superior—·namely
the assembled populace, the sovereign·—have always been,
from his point of view, a threat; and these •assemblies
of the people, which are the protective shield around the
body politic and the curb on the government, have always
been the horror of rulers. That’s why rulers spare no pains,
objections, difficulties, and promises to stop the citizens from
having •them. When the citizens are greedy, cowardly, and
small-minded, and love ease more than liberty, they don’t
long hold out against the redoubled efforts of the government;
and thus, as the resisting force ·exercised by the government·
keeps growing, the sovereign authority eventually disappears,
and most cities fall and perish before their time. [In that

Rousseau has written not of ‘cities’ but of ‘states’, and in the next few
paragraphs he flips back to ‘states’. This confirms the apparent upshot
of the footnote on page 7, where he seems to equate these two.]. . . .

But
how can small states be given the strength to resist great
ones? ·By alliances·, as the Greek towns once resisted the
great Persian king Xerxes, and as Holland and Switzerland,
more recently, have resisted the House of Austria.
But if a state can’t be kept within proper limits, there’s
one thing that can be done, namely:
Don’t have a capital, move the seat of government
from town to town, and assemble by turn in each of
the provincial estates of the country. Populate the
territory evenly, extend the same rights to everyone,
bring abundance and life everywhere.
By these means the state will become as strong and as well
governed as it possibly could be. ·In preparing for such a
state, don’t make grandiose provision for government in each
of the towns where it will temporarily reside·. Remember that
the walls of towns are built entirely out of the ruins of the
houses of the countryside! For every palace I see raised in a
capital, my mind’s eye sees a whole country made desolate.

paragraph, the words ‘the prince. . . his. . . ’ could as well have been ‘the
government. . . its. . . ’; for Rousseau those are strictly equivalent. The two
formulations don’t feel as different in French, in which ‘he’ and ‘his’ are
not distinguished from ‘it’ and ‘its’.]

But between the •sovereign authority and •arbitrary
government there sometimes comes to be an intervening
power about which something must be said.

14. How the sovereign authority is maintained
(continued)
The moment the populace is legitimately assembled as a
sovereign body, the jurisdiction of the government wholly
lapses, the executive power is suspended, and the person
of •a citizen at the bottom of the social heap is as sacred
and inviolable as that of •the first magistrate; because
representatives no longer exist in the presence of whatever

In nearly the same sense as ‘speaker’ has in the English parliament. The similarity of these functions would have brought the consuls and the
tribunes into conflict even when all jurisdiction had been suspended.

Deputies or representatives

•no-one is interested in what happens there, and

because
•it can be seen in advance that the general will won’t
prevail, and lastly because
•domestic cares are all-absorbing.

As soon as public service stops being the chief business of
the citizens, and they prefer to serve with their money rather
than with their persons, the state is not far from its collapse.
They are needed to march out to war? they pay troops and
stay at home. They are needed to meet in council? they
name deputies and stay at home. By force of laziness and
money, they end up with soldiers to enslave their country
and representatives to sell it.
It is through the hustle of commerce and the trades,
through the greedy concern for profit, and through softness
and love of amenities, that personal services are replaced by
money. Men surrender a part of their profits so as to have
time to increase them at leisure. ·And they don’t see how
dangerous this is·. Give money and before long you’ll be in
chains! This word ‘finance’ is slave talk; you won’t encounter
it in the city-state. In a truly free country the citizens do
everything with their own muscles, and nothing with money;
far from paying to be excused from their duties, they would
even pay to be allowed to perform them. My view on this
topic is far from the common one: I regard forced labour as
less opposed to liberty than taxes are. [The French is taxes; it

Good laws lead to the making of better ones; bad ones bring
about worse. As soon as anyone says of the affairs of the
state ‘What do I care?’, the state may be given up for lost.
The lukewarmness of patriotism, the activity of private
interest, the vastness of states, conquest and the abuse
of government suggested the method of having deputies
or representatives of the people in the national assemblies.
Some men in some countries have presumed to call these ‘the
Third Estate’; ·notice third ·!—putting the individual interest
of the nobility and the clergy first and second, and the public
interest third.
Sovereignty can’t be represented, for the same reason that
it can’t be alienated [see Glossary]; what sovereignty essentially
is is the general will, and a will can’t be represented; something purporting to speak for the will of x either is the will of
x or it is something else; there is no intermediate possibility,
·i.e. something that isn’t exactly x’s will but isn’t outright not
x’s will either·. The people’s deputies, therefore, can’t be its
representatives: they are merely its agents, and can’t settle
anything by themselves. Any ‘law’ that the populace hasn’t
ratified in person is null and void—it isn’t a law. The English
populace regards itself as free, but that’s quite wrong; it is
free only during the election of members of parliament. As
soon as they are elected, the populace goes into slavery, and
is nothing. The use it makes of its short moments of liberty
shows that it deserves to lose its liberty!
The idea of representation is modern; it comes to us from
feudal government, from that iniquitous and absurd system
that degrades humanity and dishonours the name of man.

could mean something like ‘fees imposed by the government’.]

The better a state’s constitution is, the more public affairs
outrank private concerns in the minds of the citizens. There
won’t even be as many private concerns ·as there are in a less
well constituted state·, because the aggregate of the common
happiness provides a bigger proportion of the happiness of
each individual, so that there’s less for him to do in taking
care of his own needs and desires. In a well-ordered city
every man flies to the assemblies; under a bad government
no-one wants to take a step to get there, because

49

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

In ancient republics and even in monarchies, the people
never had representatives; the word itself was unknown. It
is remarkable •that in Rome, where the tribunes were so
sacrosanct, no-one ever imagined that they could usurp the
functions of the people, and •that in the midst of so great a
multitude they never tried to conduct a public referendum
on their own authority. Still, we can gauge the difficulties
sometimes caused by the size of those crowds from what
happened at the time of the Gracchi, when some of the
citizens had to cast their votes from the roof-tops.
Where right and liberty are everything, disadvantages are
nothing. Among this wise people—·the ancient Romans·—
everything was given its just value: its lictors were allowed to
do what its tribunes would never have dared to do, because
it had no fear that its lictors would try to represent it.
You’ll understand how the tribunes did sometimes represent the people if you think about how the government
represents the sovereign. Law being nothing but the declaration of the general will, it’s clear that the populace in its
law-making capacity can’t be represented; but in respect of
the executive power—which is only the force that is applied
to ·implementing· the law—it can and should be represented.
We thus see that if we looked closely into the matter we
would find that very few nations have any laws! Be that as
it may, it is certain that the tribunes, having no executive
power, could never represent the Roman people •by right
of the powers entrusted to them, but only •by usurping the
rights of the senate.
In Greece, all that the populace had to do, it did for
itself; it was constantly assembled in the public square.
19

Deputies or representatives

The Greeks lived in a mild climate; they weren’t greedy;
slaves did their work for them; their great concern was with
liberty. Lacking those advantages, how can you preserve
those rights? Your harsher climates add to your needs;19
for half the year your public squares are uninhabitable; the
flatness of your languages unfits them for being heard in the
open air; you put more into profit than into liberty, and fear
slavery less than you fear poverty.
What?! Is liberty maintained only with help from slavery?
It may be so. Extremes meet. Everything that isn’t in the
course of nature has its drawbacks, especially civil society.
There are some unhappy circumstances where we can’t
keep our liberty except at others’ expense, and where the
citizen can be perfectly free only when the slave is most
a slave. That’s how things stood at Sparta. As for you,
modern peoples, you don’t have slaves but you are slaves;
you pay for their liberty with your own. Boast away about
this preference—I find in it more cowardice than humanity.
I don’t mean that one ought to have slaves, or that the
right of slavery is legitimate (I have shown that it isn’t). I’m
merely saying why modern peoples, thinking they are free,
have representatives, whereas ancient peoples didn’t. Be that
as it may, the moment a people allows itself to be represented,
it stops being free—it stops being.
All things considered, I don’t see that it is any longer
possible for the sovereign to preserve among us the exercise
of its rights, unless the city is very small. But if it is very
small, won’t it be conquered? No. I’ll show later on how a
the external strength of a great people can be combined with
the smooth politics and good order of a small state.20

To adopt in cold countries the luxury and effeminacy of the East is to want to submit to its chains—indeed to bow to them far more inevitably in our
case than in theirs.
I had intended to do this in the sequel to the present work, when in dealing with external relations I came to the subject of confederations. The
subject is quite new, and its principles have still to be laid down.

What does establish government

act; and from this is follows that it can’t be a law or an act of
sovereignty, and that consequently it would be illegitimate.
(3) It’s obvious also that ·in this supposed contract· the
contracting parties would be under nothing but the law of
nature, with no guarantees of their mutual undertakings—
which would be wholly at variance with the civil state. Someone who has force at his command is always in a position to
control execution, so the idea that I’m attacking would be on
a par with giving the label ‘contract’ to the act of one man
who said to another: ‘I give you all my goods, on condition
that you give me back as much of them as you please.’
There’s only one contract in the state; it is the contract of
association, which single-handedly rules out any others. It
is impossible to conceive of any public contract that wouldn’t
violate the first one.

Once the legislative power has been well established, the
next thing is to establish also the executive power; for this
latter, which works only through particular actions, isn’t
part of the essence of the former and so is naturally separate
from it. If the sovereign qua sovereign could possess the
executive power, right and fact would be so mixed together
that no-one could tell what was law and what wasn’t; and
the body politic, thus disfigured, would soon fall prey to the
violence it was instituted to prevent.
Because the citizens are, by the social contract, all equal,
they can all prescribe anything that all of them should do;
whereas no-one has a right to demand that someone else
shall do something that he doesn’t do himself. It is this right
that the sovereign, in instituting the government, confers
upon the prince. It’s a right that ·the prince has to have
because it· is indispensable for giving life and movement to
the body politic.
Many theorists have claimed that this act of establishment was a contract between the people and the rulers it
sets over itself—a contract specifying the conditions under
which one of the two parties was obliged to command and
the other was obliged to obey. I’m sure you’ll agree with me
that that would be an odd kind of contract to enter into! But
let us see if this view can be upheld. ·I’ll give three reasons
why it can’t·.
(1) The supreme authority can no more be modified than
it can be alienated; to limit it is to destroy it. It is absurd
and contradictory to suppose that the sovereign might set a
superior over itself; binding itself to obey a master would be
returning to ·the terrible chaos of· absolute liberty.
(2) Moreover, it is clear that this contract between the
people and such-and-such individuals would be a particular

17. What does establish government
Under what general idea then should we conceive the act
by which government is instituted? I’ll start by saying that
the act is complex, i.e. is composed of two others—(i) the
establishment of the law and (ii) the execution of the law.
By (i) the sovereign decrees that there’s to be a governing
body established in such-and-such a form; this act is clearly
a law.
By (ii) the populace picks the rulers who are to run the
government that has been established. This selection is a
particular act; so it’s clearly not another law, but merely a
consequence of the first and a function of government [= ‘an
act of the government’].
But there’s a difficulty: How can there be an act of the
government before the government exists? And how can the
populace, which is only •sovereign or •subject, become a
prince or magistrate under certain circumstances?

Protecting the government from take-overs

legitimately and in accordance with the principles I have laid
down.

[The former of those two questions arises straight out of what Rousseau
has just been saying, but the latter question doesn’t. We know his thesis
that the populace—the totality of the people—is the •sovereign through
the exercise of its general will, and is the set of •subjects because of their

taken over

obligation to obey the government. And we recall that back at page 33
he seemed to countenance the idea that the governing body might reach
the upper limit of numerousness by admitting every citizen into it. He

What I have just said confirms chapter 16, and makes it clear
•that the act that institutes government is not a contract,
but a law; •that the recipients of the executive power are
not the people’s masters, but its officers; •that it can set
them up and pull them down when it likes; •that for them
there is no question of contract, but of obedience; and •that
in taking over the functions the state has assigned to them
they’re only doing their duty as citizens, without having the
any right to challenge the conditions.
So when the populace sets up a hereditary government—
whether monarchical within one family or aristocratic within
one ·social· class—it isn’t making any promises. All it’s doing
is to give the administration a certain form, provisionally, to
last until it pleases the people to make some other arrangement.
It’s true that such changes are always dangerous, and
that an established government shouldn’t be touched unless
it has come into conflict with the public good; but this is
just a note of warning, a maxim of policy; it isn’t a legal rule,
and the state is no more bound to leave civil authority in the
hands of its rulers than it is to leave military authority in the
hands of its generals.
Care should be taken in such cases to observe all the
formalities that are required if a regular and legitimate act is
to be distinguished from a seditious tumult, and the will of
a whole people distinguished from the clamour of a faction.
‘Care should be taken’—it would be impossible to take too
much care! [This next bit expands something that Rousseau wrote

raises the matter again here because, it seems, he thinks it helps him to
answer the former of the two questions.]

At this point we encounter one of the astonishing properties of the body politic, by means of which it reconciles
apparently contradictory operations: this is done by a sudden conversion of •sovereignty into •democracy, so that with
no change that anyone could see and purely through a new
relation of all to all, the citizens become magistrates and
pass from general acts to particular acts, from legislation to
the execution of the law.
This change of relationship isn’t a theoretician’s subtlety
with no examples out there in the world. It happens every
day in the English parliament, where on certain occasions
the Lower House turns itself into a ‘committee of the whole’
so as to have a better discussion of affairs, so that from
being at one moment a sovereign court it becomes at the
next a mere commission, ·an organ of government·; then it
reports the upshot of these discussions to itself as House
of Commons, where it debates under one name what it has
already settled under another.
That’s the special advantage of democratic government—
that it can be brought into existence by a simple act of the
general will. And then this provisional government remains
in power, if that’s what was decided, or else it, acting in the
name of the sovereign, establishes the government that is
prescribed by law; and thus the whole thing is done by the
rules. That’s the only possible way to set up government
52

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

Here above all the government, when
confronted with claims of rights that it thinks would be
especially dangerous to allow, should allow only what it
legally must. This obligation gives the prince a great advantage in preserving his power despite the people, without
its being possible to say he has usurped it; for, seeming
only to •exercise his rights, he finds it very easy to •extend
them, and to use the ‘keeping the peace’ excuse to prevent
gatherings that were to have been aimed at restoring order.
In this way he takes advantage of •a silence that he doesn’t
allow to be broken, or of •irregularities that he causes to
be committed, to •assume that he has the support of those
whom fear prevents from speaking, and to •punish those
who dare to speak. That is how ancient Rome’s decemvirs,
first elected for one year and then kept on in office for a
second, tried to make their power permanent by forbidding
the comitia to assemble; and by this easy method every
government in the world, once it is clothed with the public
power, sooner or later usurps the sovereign authority. [The

Protecting the government from take-overs

The periodical assemblies that I spoke of earlier [page 47]
are a device for preventing or postponing this calamity. Their
chance of succeeding in that is greater if they don’t have to
be formally summoned, because then the prince can’t stop
them without openly declaring himself a law-breaker and an
enemy of the state.
These assemblies, whose sole object is the maintenance of
the social treaty, should open by the posing of two questions
that •must never be suppressed and •should be voted on
separately:
(1) ‘Does it please the sovereign to preserve the present
form of government?’
(2) ‘Does it please the people to leave its administration
in the hands of those who are currently in charge of
it?’
I’m assuming here something that I think I have shown,
namely that there is in the state no fundamental law that
can’t be revoked. Even the social compact itself can be
revoked: if all the citizens came together for the agreed
purpose of breaking the compact, there’s no doubt that this
would very legitimately break it. Grotius even thinks that
each man can renounce his membership of his own state,
and recover his natural liberty and his goods on leaving the
country.21 It would be absurd if all the citizens in assembly

Cromwell would have been sentenced to hard labour by the
people of Berne, and the Duc de Beaufort would have been
put in a reformatory by the Genevese!
But when the social bond begins to slacken and the
state to grow weak, when particular interests start to make
themselves felt and the smaller societies begin to influence
the larger one, the common interest changes and comes
to have opponents; votes are no longer unanimous; the
general will is no longer the will of all; contradictory views
are presented and debates start up; and the best advice isn’t
accepted without question. Finally,
•when the nearly ruined state exists only in an illusory
and empty form, when
•in every heart the social bond is broken, and when
•the meanest interest brazenly helps itself to the sacred
name of ‘public good’,
the general will falls silent: all men, guided by secret motives,
stop giving their views as citizens (it’s as though there had
never been a state); and wicked decrees directed solely to
private interest get passed off as ‘laws’.
Does it follow from this that the general will is exterminated or corrupted? Not at all: it continues to be constant,
unalterable and pure; but it is pushed aside by other wills
that invade its territory. Each man, in distinguishing his
interests from the common interest, sees clearly that he
can’t entirely separate them, ·i.e. that his pursuit of his
own interests will have some negative effect on the common
good·; but he sees •his share in the public misfortunes as
negligible compared with •the private good that he is laying
claim to. Apart from this private good, he wills the general

As long as a number of men gathered together regard themselves as a single body, they have only a single will, which
is concerned with the survival and well-being of all of them.
In this case, the state’s machinery is all vigorous and simple
and its rules clear and luminous; there’s no tangle of hidden
agendas; the common good is always obvious, and only good
sense is needed to perceive it. Peace, unity and equality are
enemies of political subtleties. Simple straightforward men
are hard to deceive because of their simplicity; lures and
ingenious excuses don’t work with them—they aren’t even
subtle enough to be dupes! When among the world’s happiest
people we see a group of peasants gathered under an oak
to regulate the state’s affairs, and always acting wisely, can
we help scorning the sophistication of other nations, which
put so much skill and so much mystery into making make
themselves illustrious and wretched?
A state governed like that doesn’t need many laws; and
when new ones are needed, everyone will see that they are.
The first man to propose them is merely putting into words
what they have all been thinking, and there’s no place here
for deals or for eloquence in order to get passed into law
something that each of them has already decided to do as
soon as he’s sure that the rest will act with him.
Theorists are struck by the impossibility of applying such
procedures to any state that they have seen; but they go
wrong about this, because the only states they have looked
at are ones that were badly constituted from the beginning.

good as strongly as anyone else because it’s in his interests
to do so. Even when he sells his vote for money, he does
not extinguish the general will in himself, but only dodges
around it. The wrong thing he does is to change the question,
answering a different question from the one he was asked.
Instead of giving a vote that says
‘It is to the state’s advantage that such-and-such
should happen’,
he says through his vote
‘It is to x’s advantage that such-and-such should
happen’,
where x is some man or faction. The law of public order—
·i.e. the thing that it matters most to have happen·—in
assemblies is not so much •maintaining the general will as
•ensuring that it is consulted and that it answers.
I could offer many reflections on the simple right of voting
in every act of sovereignty—a right that no-one can take from
the citizens—and also on the right of stating views, making
proposals, dividing and discussing, which the government is
always most careful to leave solely to its members; but this
important subject would need a book to itself—I can’t say
everything in this one.

This seems less obvious when a state’s constitution contains two or more orders of citizens, like ancient Rome’s
nobility and plebeians, whose quarrels often disturbed the
comitia [see page 61], even in the best days of the Republic.
But the exception is apparent rather than real; because in
that case the inherent defect in the body politic brings it
about that there are, so to speak, two states in one, and
what’s not true of the two together is true of each separately.
Indeed, even in the most stormy times, the plebiscites of the
people—as long as the Senate didn’t get involved—always
went through quietly and by large majorities: the citizens
had only one interest, so the people had only one will.
At the other end of the political spectrum, unanimity
circles back: that’s when the citizens, having fallen into
servitude, no longer have any liberty or any will. Fear
and flattery then convert •voting into •acclamation; no-one
considers issues any more; all they do is to fawn ·on those in
power· or to curse ·their rivals·. Such was the vile manner in
which the senate expressed its ‘views’ under the Emperors. It
did so sometimes with absurd precautions: Tacitus reports
that under the emperor Otho the senators, in heaping curses
on Vitellius, arranged to make a deafening noise so that if
Vitellius ever became their master he wouldn’t know what
each of them had said!
What rules should govern the methods of counting votes
and comparing opinions? That depends on the factors I have
been discussing, i.e. on how easy or hard it is to discover
what the general will is, and on how far along the state is in
its decline.
There’s only one law that from its very nature needs
unanimous consent, namely the social compact; for civil
association is the most voluntary of all acts. Every man is
born free and his own master, so no-one on any pretext—any
pretext—can make any man a subject without his consent.

2. Voting
You [see Glossary] can see from the last chapter that a pretty
good indication of the current state of mœurs [see Glossary]
and the health of the body politic is given by the facts about
how general business is managed by it. . . . The nearer
opinion comes to unanimity, the greater is the dominance
of the general will; whereas long debates, dissensions and
tumult proclaim •the domination by particular interests and
•the decline of the state.

To rule that the son of a slave is born a slave is to rule that
he isn’t born a man.
So if the social compact has opponents at the time when
it is made, their opposition doesn’t invalidate the contract; it
merely prevents them from being included in it, making them
foreigners among citizens. Once a state has been instituted,
residence constitutes consent; to live within its territory is to
submit to its sovereignty.22

In my earlier demonstration [page 14] of how particular
wills are substituted for the general will in public deliberations, I said enough about the workable methods for avoiding
this abuse; and I’ll return to them later on. I also set out
the principles for deciding how big a majority is needed for
a declaration of that will. A difference of one vote destroys
equality; a single opponent destroys unanimity; but between
50-50 and unanimity there are many grades of unequal
division—·many differences in how steep the majority-tominority slope is·—and which of these is sufficient for a
decision to be made will vary according to the needs of the

conform to wills that are not his own. How are the opponents
at once free and subject to laws they have not agreed to?
I reply that the question is wrongly put. The citizen gives
his consent to all the laws, including ones that are passed
against his opposition, and even laws that punish him when
he dares to break any law. The constant will of all the
members of the state is the general will; by virtue of it
they are citizens and free.23 When a law is proposed to
the assembled people, what they are being asked is not
(1) Do you approve or reject this proposal?
but rather
(2) Is this proposal in conformity with the general will?
—the general will being their will. Each man’s vote gives his
opinion on that point, ·i.e. his answer to question (2)·; and
the general will is found by counting votes. When therefore

Two general rules provide guidance to the decisions about
majorities. (i) The more serious and important the question
that is being put to the vote, the nearer to unanimity the
threshold should be set. (ii) The more the subject of the
question calls for speed, the smaller the majority can be
allowed to be; and where an instant decision has to be

This should of course be understood as applying to a free state. In any other kind of state a man may be kept in a country against his will—by
considerations of family, goods, lack of a refuge, necessity, or violence—and then his dwelling there no longer by itself implies anything about his
attitude—either way—to the contract.
At Genoa, the word ‘Liberty’ appears over the front of the prisons and on the chains of the prisoners serving in the galleys. This use of the device is
good and just. Indeed it’s only the criminals—rich, poor, and middling—who prevent the citizen from being free. In a country where all such men
were pulling oars in the galleys, the most perfect liberty would be enjoyed.

reached, a majority of one vote should be enough. Of these
two rules, (i) seems more in harmony with the laws, and (ii)
seems more in harmony with practical affairs. Anyway, it’s
the combination of them that does the best job of deciding
what size of majority a given question needs.

distinction; it confirms it. The mixed form of election suits a
mixed government. ·And the government of Venice is indeed
mixed·; for it is an error to think it is a real aristocracy.
Granted, the populace has no share in the government;
but in Venice the nobility is the populace. That includes a
host of poor younger sons—·and younger sons of younger
sons—of noble families·; they never get near to having any
position in the government, and all their ‘nobility’ brings
them is •the silly right to be addressed as ‘Your Excellency’
and •the right to sit in the Great Council—which has as
many members as our General Council at Geneva, so that
its ‘illustrious’ members have no more privileges than do
our plain citizens. It is indisputable that although the
two republics are extremely different in many ways, the
bourgeoisie of Geneva exactly matches the nobility of Venice;
our natives and inhabitants match the townsmen and the
people of Venice; our peasants match the ·Venetian· subjects
on the mainland ·as distinct from the ones who live on
the cluster of islands that constitute the historic heart of
Venice·; and whatever way you look at it (setting aside its
size), Venice’s government is no more aristocratic than our
own. The whole difference is that we have no need to use
the lottery, because our rulers are not appointed for life as
Venice’s are.
Election by lottery would have few drawbacks in a real
democracy, where it would hardly matter who was chosen
because all the people would be on a par as regards mœurs
and talents as well as principles and fortunes. But I have
already said that there aren’t any democracies. [The end of 3:4

3. Elections
In the elections of the prince and the magistrates (which
are, I repeat, complex acts) there are two possible ways to
proceed, •choosing and •drawing lots. Both have been used
in various republics, and a highly complicated mixture of the
two still survives in the election of the Doge at Venice.
’Election by lottery’, says Montesquieu, ‘is democratic in
nature’. I agree that it is, but how is it? ‘The lottery’, he goes
on, ‘is a way of electing that isn’t unfair to anyone; it leaves
each citizen with a reasonable hope of serving his country.’
Those aren’t reasons!
If we bear in mind that the election of rulers is something
done by government, not by sovereignty, we’ll see ·the real
reason· why the lottery is the more natural for democracy—a
form of government where the administration is better in
proportion as the number of its acts is small.
In any real democracy, magistracy isn’t a benefit—it’s
a burdensome responsibility that can’t fairly be imposed
on one individual rather than another. If the individual is
selected by a lottery, the selection is being made by the
law that establishes the lottery; but the law doesn’t lose
its universality by itself picking out one individual, and no
choice has been made that depends on any human will.
In an aristocracy, the prince chooses the prince, the
government is preserved by itself, and that’s the right kind
of situation for voting.
The way they elect the Doge of Venice doesn’t squash this

When choice and lottery are combined, positions that
require special talents, such as military posts, should be
filled by choice; the lottery serves for the likes of judicial
offices, in which good sense, justice, and integrity are all

that’s needed, because in a well constituted state these
qualities are common to all the citizens.
Neither lottery nor vote has any place in monarchical
government. The monarch being by right sole prince and
only magistrate, it is for him alone to choose his lieutenants.
When the Abbé de Saint-Pierre proposed that the Councils of
the King of France should be multiplied, and their members
elected by ballot, he didn’t see that he was proposing to
change the ·fundamental· form of government.
I should now speak of the methods of giving and counting
opinions in the assembly of the people; but perhaps an
historical account of this aspect of Roman politics will give
you more of a sense of the rules I could lay down. It is worth
the while of a judicious reader to follow in some detail the
working of public and private affairs in a council with two
hundred thousand members.

earth exercised its supreme power.
After the foundation of Rome, the new-born republic—i.e.
the army of its founder, composed of Albans, Sabines and
foreigners—was divided into three classes which then came
to be called ‘tribes’. Each of these tribes was subdivided into
ten curiae, and each curia into decuriae, headed by leaders
called curiones and decuriones.
Besides this, out of each tribe was taken a body of one
hundred cavalrymen or knights, called a ‘century’, which
shows that these divisions, being unnecessary in a town,
were at first merely military. But an instinct for greatness
seems to have led the little town of Rome to provide itself in
advance with a political system suitable for the capital of the
world.
[Regarding this next paragraph: Servius was a king of Rome in the

Out of this original division an awkward
situation soon arose. The tribes of the Albans and the
Sabines remained always in the same condition, while that of
the foreigners continually grew as more and more foreigners
came to live in Rome, so that it soon surpassed the others
·in strength·. Servius remedied this dangerous fault by abolishing the racial basis for the division into tribes, replacing
it by a geographical one—four tribes now, each containing
the inhabitants of one of the hills of Rome, after which it was
named. In this way, while fixing the immediate inequality
problem Servius also provided for the future; and so that
the division might be one of persons as well as localities, he
forbade the inhabitants of one quarter to migrate to another,
and so prevented the mingling of the races.
He also doubled ·the size of· the three old ‘centuries’
of knights, and added twelve more, still keeping the old
names, and by this simple and prudent method he drew a
line between the body of knights and the people, without a
murmur from the people.

4. The comitia in ancient Rome
We have no reliable records of Rome’s early years; it seems
very likely, indeed, that most of the stories told about it are
fables. In general, the most instructive part of the history
of peoples, namely the past dealing with their foundation,
is just what we have least of. Experience teaches us every
day what causes generate the revolutions of empires; but
new peoples are not formed these days, so we have almost
nothing beyond conjecture to go upon in explaining how they
were created.
The customs we find established show at least that these
customs had an origin. The traditions that go back to those
origins, and have the greatest authorities behind them, and
are confirmed by the strongest evidence, should count as
the most certain. These are the rules I have tried to follow
in investigating how the freest and most powerful people on

To the four urban tribes Servius added fifteen others
called rural tribes, because they consisted of those who lived
in the country, divided into fifteen cantons. Subsequently,
fifteen more were created, and the Roman people finally
found itself divided into thirty-five tribes, as it remained
down to the end of the Republic.
The distinction between urban and rural tribes had one
effect that is worth noting, because •it is the only example of
its kind, and because •Rome owed to it the preservation of
her mœurs [see Glossary] and the enlargement of her empire.
One would have expected that the urban tribes would soon
monopolise power and honours, losing no time in pushing
the rural tribes down into poverty and weakness; but what
happened was exactly the reverse. The taste of the early
Romans for country life is well known. They owed this taste
to their wise founder, who made rural and military labours
go along with •liberty and (as it were) pushed off into the
town •arts, •trades, •intrigue, •luck, and •slavery. [By ‘their

The comitia in ancient Rome

tribes were honoured because of the men of whom they were
composed; and their way of dishonouring a coward was to
subject him to the public disgrace of being transferred into
an urban tribe. . . . Freed slaves always entered the urban
tribes, never the rural ones; and although freed slaves could
become citizens, there isn’t a single example, throughout the
Republic, of a freed slave reaching any magistracy [= ‘being
appointed to a position as a government official’].
This was an excellent rule; but it was carried so far that
in the end it led to a change and certainly to an abuse in the
political system.
First the censors, after many years of claiming the right to
choose what tribe a citizen could be transferred to, eventually
allowed most people to enroll themselves in whatever tribe
they pleased. This permission certainly did no good, and
deprived the censorship of one of its main sources of power.
Moreover, as the great and powerful all had themselves
enrolled in the country tribes, while the freed slaves who
had become citizens remained with the populace in the town
tribes, the tribes in general soon stopped having any local
or territorial meaning, and all were so confused that the
members of one could not be told from those of another
except through the membership lists; so that the idea of
‘tribe’ became personal instead of real, or rather came to be
little more than a chimera.
It happened also that the urban tribes, being more on
the spot, were often the stronger in the •comitia and sold
the state to those who stooped to buy the votes of the rabble
composing •them. [The comitia will be explained on page 61.]
As the founder had set up ten curiae in each tribe, the

gods, its officers, its priests and its festivals. . . .

wise founder’, Rousseau means Romulus—a purely mythical founder of
Rome, though Rousseau may have thought he was real, as did all the
Roman historians on whose work he relies.]

Thus, because all Rome’s most illustrious citizens lived
in the fields and tilled the earth, the countryside came to be
the only place where they looked for the people who would
keep the republic running. This rural way of life, being that
of the best nobles, was honoured by everyone; the simple
and hard-working life of the villager was preferred to the
slack and idle life of the bourgeoisie of Rome; and someone
who in the town would have been a wretched proletarian
became, as a labourer in the fields, a respected citizen. Our
great-souled ancestors, says Varro, knew what they were
doing when they established in the villages the nursery of
the tough, brave men who •defended them in time of war and
•fed them in time of peace. Pliny says explicitly that the rural

When Servius made his new division, as the thirty curiae
couldn’t be shared equally between his four tribes, and he
didn’t want to interfere with them; so they became a further
division of the inhabitants of Rome, quite independent of
the tribes. But curiae didn’t have any bearing on the rural
tribes or their members, because for them the tribes had
become a purely civil institution, and a new system for
raising troops had been introduced, making the military
divisions of Romulus superfluous. [Rousseau hasn’t said explicitly

census.) Lastly, he ordered that the assembly should be held
in the Campus Martius, and everyone whose age made him
liable for military service should bring his weapons.
Why didn’t he divide the last class into young and old?
Because its members weren’t given the right to bear arms
for the country: to have the right to defend hearth and home,
a man had to have a hearth and home! Of all the countless
troops of beggars who to-day lend lustre to the armies of
kings, there is perhaps not one who wouldn’t have been
scornfully driven out of a Roman platoon back in the days
when soldiers were the defenders of liberty.

that the division into curiae was a military one; the reader is presumably

Thus, although every citizen was enrolled
in a tribe, many of them were not members of a curia.
Servius also made a third division—quite distinct from
the two I have mentioned—and the effects of this made it
the most important of the three. He sorted the whole Roman
people into six classes, distinguished not by place or person
but by wealth; the first classes included the rich, the last
the poor, and those in between included people of moderate
means. These six classes were subdivided into 183 other
bodies, called ‘centuries’, which were distributed in such
a way that the first class alone comprised more than half
of them, while the last class comprised only one. Thus
the class that had the fewest members contained the most
centuries, and the whole of the last class—which included
more than half the inhabitants of Rome—only counted as a
single subdivision, ·a single century·.
To veil the results of this arrangement from the people,
Servius tried to give it a military tone: in the second class he
inserted two centuries of armourers, and in the fourth two
of ·makers of· weapons; and in each class except the last he
distinguished young from old, i.e. distinguished those who
were obliged to bear arms from those whose age gave them
legal exemption. (It was this distinction, rather than that of
wealth, that created the need for frequent repetition of the
expected to know this,]

[Rousseau will now refer to certain people (in Latin) as capite censi =
‘head-count people’.

They couldn’t figure in a census through their

number of houses, businesses, animals, slaves etc., because they didn’t
own anything.]

But this last class was further divided into

•proletarians and the •capite censi. The proletarians, not

quite reduced to nothing, at least gave the state citizens and
in some times of great need even gave it soldiers. The capite
censi, who had nothing at all and could be numbered only by
counting heads, were regarded as zeroes, and Marius—·four
centuries after Servius·—was the first who stooped to enroll
them.
Without deciding now whether this third arrangement
was good or bad in itself, I think I can say that it couldn’t
have worked if it weren’t for the early Romans’ simple mœurs
[see Glossary], disinterestedness, liking for agriculture, and
scorn for commerce and the profit motive. Where is the
modern people among whom consuming greed, restlessness,
intrigue, continual promotions and demotions, and perpetual
changes of fortune, could leave such a system in place for
·even· twenty years without toppling the entire state? I
should add that mœurs and the censorship [see Glossary],
being stronger than this institution, corrected its defects
at Rome—·for example·, a rich man who made too much

business didn’t have time to spend the day in the public
square. By means of (c), the senate kept a tight rein on
the proud and restive people, and (when this was needed)
restrained the ardour of seditious tribunes; though the
tribunes found more than one way of getting around this
hindrance.
The comitia passed judgment on more than merely laws
and the election of rulers; the Roman populace took on itself
the most important functions of government. It can be said
that the fate of Europe was regulated in its assemblies! The
variety of things they dealt with created variety in the forms
they took.
To form a judgment about these various forms, all we
need do is to compare them. When Romulus set up the
curiae, his aim was to use the people to check the senate,
and the senate to check the people, while continuing to
dominate both. So he set things up in such a way that
the people would have all the authority of •numbers to
balance the authority of •power and riches, which he left
to the nobility. But in the spirit of monarchy he gave a
greater advantage to the nobility through the influence of
their clients on vote-numbers. This admirable institution
of •patron and •client was a masterpiece of statesmanship
and humanity without which the nobility as a class, being
flagrantly in contradiction to the republican spirit, couldn’t
have survived. Rome alone has the honour of having given to
the world this great example, which never led to any abuse
but has never been followed.
The assemblies by curiae persisted under the kings till
the time of Servius. . . . Under the Republic the curiae,
still confined to the four urban tribes and containing only
the populace of Rome, didn’t suit the senate (which led

‘stronger than any tendencies in ancient Rome to greed, restlessness,
intrigue etc.’.]

So it’s easy to see why usually only five classes are
mentioned, though there were really six. Because the sixth
didn’t provide soldiers for the army or votes in the Campus
Martius,24 and was almost without function in the state, it
was seldom regarded as of any account.
These were the various ways in which the Roman people
was divided. Let us now see how these divisions affected
the assemblies. When lawfully summoned, these assemblies
were called comitia: they were usually held in the public
square or in the Campus Martius, and were of three kinds:
(1) the comitia curiata, which were founded by Romulus,
(2) the comitia centuriata, which were founded by Servius,
and
(3) the comitia tributa which were founded by the tribunes
of the people.
No law received its sanction and no magistrate was elected
except in the comitia; and as every citizen was enrolled in a
curia, a century, or a tribe, it follows that every citizen had
the right to vote, and that the Roman populace was truly
sovereign—both •as a matter of law and •in fact.
For the comitia to be lawfully assembled, and for their
acts to have the force of law, three conditions had to be met.
(a) The body or magistrate convoking them had to have the
authority to do so. (b) The assembly had to be held on a day
allowed by law. (c) The auguries had to be favourable.
The reason for (a) needs no explanation. (b) is a matter of
policy; for example, the comitia were not to held on festivals
or market-days, when the country-folk coming to Rome on

I say ‘in the Campus Martius’ because that is where the comitia assembled by centuries; in its two other forms the populace assembled in the forum
or elsewhere; and then the ‘counted heads’ had as much influence and authority as the foremost citizens.

the ‘nobles’) or the tribunes (who, though plebeians, led
the well-to-do citizens). They therefore fell into disrepute,
and their degradation was such that what the ·full· comitia
curiata should have done was done by an assembly of their
thirty lictors.
The division by centuries was so favourable to the aristocracy that it’s hard to see at first how the senate ever failed
to prevail in the comitia bearing their name—·the comitia
centuriata ·—by which the consuls, the censors and the other
senior magistrates were elected. Indeed, of the 193 centuries
into which the six classes of the whole Roman people were
divided, the first class contained 98; and, as voting went
solely by centuries, this class alone had a majority over
all the rest. When all those centuries were in agreement,
the rest of the votes weren’t even taken; the decision of the
smallest number counted as the decision of the multitude,
and it’s fair to say that in the comitia centuriata decisions
were regulated by amounts of money more than by numbers
of votes.
But this extreme authority was modified in two ways.
First, the tribunes usually belonged to the class of the rich,
and so did many plebeians; so they counterbalanced the
influence of the nobles in the first class.
The second way was this. Instead of having the centuries
vote in order, so that the first century always voted first, the
Romans always chose by lottery one century that went ahead
and voted, and then on another day the remaining centuries
were called to vote in the order of their ranks. They usually
agreed with the vote of the first one that voted. In this way,
the authority of example—·i.e. the influence you get from
going first·—was handed out not according to rank but by
lottery, on a democratic principle.
This custom had a further advantage. The citizens from
the countryside had time, between the two elections, to

4 4.

The comitia in ancient Rome

inform themselves of the merits of the candidate who had
been voted for first time around, and didn’t have to vote
without knowledge of the case. But under the pretext of
avoiding delays this custom was eventually abolished, and
both elections were held on the same day.
The comitia tributa were properly a council of the Roman
people. Only the tribunes could call them together; at them
the tribunes were elected and conducted their plebiscites.
The senate had no standing in them, and wasn’t even entitled
to be present; and the senators, being forced to obey laws
that they couldn’t vote on, were in this respect less free
than the lowest citizens. This injustice was entirely wrong,
and was alone enough to invalidate the decrees of a body
to which all its members were not admitted. If the nobles
had attended the comitia by virtue of their right as citizens,
they would have been there as mere private individuals, and
would have had very little influence on a vote reckoned by
counting heads, where the lowest proletarian was as good as
the leader of the senate.
So you can see •that order was achieved by these various
ways of dividing up this great people and taking its votes;
and •that the different divisions didn’t have at their basis
some neutral way of carving up the population. Each one of
them was preferred because of what was expected to result
from it.
Never mind the further details. What I have said shows
that
•the comitia tributa were the most favourable to popular government [= ‘democracy’],
•the comitia centuriata were the most favourable to
aristocracy, and
•the comitia curiata, in which the populace of Rome
formed the majority, was good for nothing but to
further tyranny and evil designs.
62

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

Naturally the comitia curiata fell into disrepute, and even
seditious persons abstained from using this method because
is would too clearly show what they were up to. There’s no
question about it: the whole majesty of the Roman people
lay solely in the comitia centuriata, the only comitia that
included everyone; for the comitia curiata excluded the rural
tribes and the comitia tributa excluded the senate and the
nobility.
As for the method of taking the vote, among the ancient
Romans that was as simple as their mœurs, though Sparta’s
was even simpler. Each man declared his vote aloud, and
a clerk duly wrote it down; the majority in each tribe determined the vote of the tribe, the majority of the tribes that of
the people; similarly with curiae and centuries. This custom
was good as long as honesty was triumphant among the
citizens, and each man was ashamed to vote publicly in
favour of an unjust proposal or an unworthy person; but
when the people grew corrupt and votes were bought, it was
fitting that voting should be secret so as to deter purchasers
who wouldn’t trust ·that the votes they had bought would be
delivered· and to give rogues a way of not being traitors.
(I know that Cicero attacks this change ·to secrecy in
voting· and gives it some of the blame for the ruin of the
Republic. I feel the weight that Cicero’s authority must carry
on a point like this, but I can’t agree with him; I hold, on the
contrary, that the destruction of a state will be hastened if
changes like this are not made. Just as the regimen of health
doesn’t suit the sick, it’s wrong to try to govern a corrupted
people by laws that would be right for a good people. There’s
no better evidence for this thesis than the long life of the
Republic of Venice. It still exists—or anyway a shadow of it
does—solely because its laws are suitable only for wicked
men.)

4 5.

Tribunes

So the citizens were provided with tablets with which each
man could vote without anyone knowing how he voted: new
procedures were also introduced for collecting the tablets,
for counting votes, for comparing numbers, etc.; yet despite
all this, the good faith of the officers charged with these
functions. . . . was often suspect. Finally, to prevent intrigues
and trafficking in votes, edicts were issued; but their very
number proves how useless they were.
Towards the end of the Republic, it was often necessary to bring in special procedures in order to make up
for the inadequacy of the laws. Sometimes miracles were
supposed—·i.e. the authorities reported miraculous events
that pointed to the need for some political question to be
answered one way rather than another·—but this method,
while it might deceive the populace, couldn’t deceive those
who governed it. Sometimes an assembly ·for voting· was
called together suddenly, leaving the candidates with no
time to form their factions. Sometimes, when it was seen
that the people were already primed to vote ·in what the
authorities thought to be· the wrong way, the entire meeting
was allowed to play itself out in talk, ·with no vote being
taken·. But in the end ambition always got away. The most
incredible fact of all is that in the midst of all these abuses
this enormous populace relied on its ancient regulations and
went ahead electing magistrates, passing laws, judging cases,
and carrying through public and private business, doing all
this almost as easily as the senate itself could have done.

5. Tribunes
When an exact proportion can’t be established between the
constituent parts of a state, or when the relation of one part
to another is constantly being altered by some cause that
can’t be stopped, a special kind of governmental entity is
63

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

instituted, one which
•isn’t an integral part of any larger governmental body,
•gets each term—·each bit of the political structure·—
back into its right relation with the others, and
•is a middle term connecting the prince with people, or
the prince with the sovereign, or both at once if need
be.
This body, which I shall call ‘the tribunate’, is the guardian of
the laws and of the legislative power. Sometimes it protects
the sovereign against the government, as the tribunes of the
people did in Rome; sometimes it upholds the government
against the people, as the Council of Ten does now in Venice;
and sometimes it maintains the balance between the two, as
the Ephors did in Sparta.

4 5.

Tribunes

The tribunate, wisely tempered, is the strongest support a
good constitution can have; but if its strength is even slightly
excessive, it overturns everything. As for weakness—that’s
not in its nature; provided it is something, the tribunate is
never less than it should be.
It degenerates into tyranny when it
usurps the executive power that it should be moderating, and when it
tries to dispense with the laws that it should be
protecting.
The immense power of the Ephors, harmless as long as
Sparta preserved its mœurs [see Glossary], hastened Sparta’s
corruption when once it had begun. . . . Rome perished in
the same way: the excessive power of the tribunes, which
they had acquired by decreeing that they had it, finally used
laws that had been made to secure liberty as a protective
shield for the emperors who destroyed liberty. As for the
Venetian Council of Ten, it is a tribunal of blood, an object of
horror for nobles and people alike. Far from providing a lofty
protection for the laws, it does nothing, now that the laws
have become degraded, but strike in the darkness blows that
no-one dares to notice.
The tribunate, like the government, weakens as its membership grows. The tribunes of the Roman people started at
two, then went up to five; and when they wanted to double
that number, the senate let them do so, in the confidence
that it could play them off against one another, which indeed
it did!
The best way to prevent such a formidable body from
getting out of hand—though no government has yet tried
this—would be to have regular periods during which it
doesn’t exist, rather than its being at work continuously.
These intermissions shouldn’t be long enough to give abuses
time to grow strong; the law establishing them should be

[This paragraph will use the word ‘city’ for the first time since page 50.
Recall Rousseau’s distinction in the footnote on page 7 between ‘city’ and

The tribunate isn’t a constituent part of the city, and
should have no share in either the legislative or the executive
power; but this very fact makes its own power the greater,
because while it can’t do anything it can prevent anything
from being done. It is more sacred and more revered as the
defender of the laws than the prince that applies them or
the sovereign that issues them. This was seen very clearly at
Rome, when the proud nobles who always scorned the people
were forced to bow before a mere officer of the people—·a
tribune·—who

The Social Contract

Dictatorship

If the trouble can be fixed by increasing •the government’s
activity, power is concentrated in the hands of one or two of
•its members. In this case the change is not in the authority
of the laws but only in the form of administering them. But
if the peril is of such a kind that the apparatus of the laws
is an obstacle to saving the laws, the method is to nominate
a supreme ruler who is to silence all the laws and briefly
suspend the sovereign authority. In such a case there’s no
doubt about the general will: it’s clear that the people’s first
intention is that the state is not to perish. So the suspension
of the legislative authority is not its abolition; the magistrate
who keeps it quiet can’t make it speak; he dominates it, but
can’t represent it. The only thing he can’t do is to make laws.

framed in such a way that the intermissions can easily be
shortened when there’s a need for that.
I can’t see that this method has any drawbacks, because
the tribunate—as I said before—isn’t part of the constitution,
so that its removal won’t do the constitution any harm.
It also seems to be efficacious, because a newly restored
magistrate starts not with the power his predecessor had but
with what the law allows him. [Notice: •Rousseau evidently thinks
of the periods of remission as involving a change in the membership of
the tribunate; and •although the tribunate isn’t part of the government
its members are here called ‘magistrates’.]

6. Dictatorship

[By ‘can’t make it speak’ Rousseau seems to mean ‘can’t speak for it’.]

The inflexibility of the laws prevents them from being adapted
to circumstances, and in some situations that makes them
disastrous, causing the ruin of the state at a time of crisis.
They require things to be done slowly, in an orderly fashion,
requiring a stretch of time that the world doesn’t always
provide. Countless things can happen that the legislator
hasn’t provided for; you can’t foresee everything; and being
aware of that fact is a highly necessary part of foresight!
So it is wrong to want to make political institutions so
strong that their operation can’t suspended. Even Sparta
allowed its laws to lapse.
But only the greatest dangers can outweigh the danger
of changing the public order; and the sacred power of the
laws should never be suspended unless the existence of the
country is at stake. In the rare cases where it is obvious that
that is what’s at stake, •the public security is provided for
by a special act entrusting •it to whoever is most worthy to
have it. This can be done in either of two ways, depending
on the nature of the danger.
25

4 6.

The first method was used by the Roman senate when, in
a consecrated formula [i.e. in a solemn ceremony presided over by
priests], it charged the consuls with taking care of the safety of
the Republic. The second was employed when one of the two
consuls nominated a dictator,25 a procedure Rome borrowed
from Alba.
During the first period of the Republic they often fell
back on dictatorship, because the state wasn’t yet solidly
grounded enough to be able to maintain itself by the strength
of its constitution alone. At that time the mœurs made
superfluous many of the precautions that would have been
necessary at other times; so there was no fear that a dictator
would abuse his authority or try to keep it beyond his term of
office. Quite the opposite: those who had dictatorial powers
found them burdensome, and got rid of them as soon as
possible—as if taking the place of the laws had been too
troublesome and too perilous a position to retain.

The nomination was made secretly by night, as if there were something shameful in setting a man above the laws.

65

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

The early Roman use of this supreme magistracy—
dictatorship—wasn’t wise; what I hold against it is not the
risk of its being abused but the risk of its of its becoming
cheap. When it was being freely employed at elections,
dedications and purely formal functions, there was a danger
of its becoming less formidable in time of need—a danger
that men would come to think of it as an empty title that
was used only on occasions of empty ceremonial.
Towards the end of the Republic, the Romans, having
grown more circumspect, were as unreasonably •sparing in
their use of dictatorship as they had formerly been •lavish.
It was easy to see that their fears were unfounded: the
capital’s weakness made it safe from the magistrates who
lived there; a dictator might sometimes •defend the public
liberty but would never be in a position to •endanger it; and
Rome’s chains would be forged not in Rome itself but in its
armies. The weakness of Marius’s resistance to Sulla, and of
Pompey’s to Caesar, clearly showed what could be expected
from authority at home against force from abroad.
This misconception led the Romans to make great mistakes; such, for example, as the failure to nominate a dictator
in the Catilinarian conspiracy. [Rousseau goes into details
of this enormously complex (and still controversial) matter.
He holds that a dictator could have swiftly cleaned the whole
thing up, whereas in fact it was a long-drawn-out affair
involving criminal trials and a mixture of good and bad
behaviour by Cicero, who was a consul at the time as well
as a professional litigating lawyer. That everything worked
out satisfactorily from Rome’s point of view, Rousseau says,
was better luck than Rome deserved.]
However this important trust is conferred, its duration
should be fixed for a very brief period that is never to be
prolonged. In the crises that lead to the appointment of a
dictator, the state is going to be soon lost or soon saved; and

4 7.

Censorship

when the emergency is over, the dictatorship becomes either
tyrannical or idle. In Rome, where dictators held office for
only six months, most of them abdicated before their time
was up. If their term had been longer, they might well have
tried to prolong it still further, as the decemvirs did when
chosen for a year. The dictator had only time to deal with
the need that had caused him to be chosen; he had no time
to think of further projects.

7. Censorship
Just as the general will is declared by the law, the public
judgment is declared by the censorship [see Glossary]. Public
opinion is the sort of law that the censor administers; all he
does is to apply it to particular cases, in the same fashion as
the prince.
The censorial tribunal doesn’t •pass judgment on the
people’s opinion; it only •declares it, and as soon as the two
part company its decisions are null and void.
It’s pointless to distinguish •the mœurs [see Glossary] of
a nation from •the objects of its esteem; they both come
from the same source, and can’t be disentangled from one
another. In every nation on earth the choice of the people’s
pleasures is decided not by nature but by opinion. Correct
men’s opinions, and their mœurs will purify themselves. Men
always love what is good or what they find good; where they
go wrong is in their judgments about what is good. What
needs to be regulated, then, is this judgment. In making
judgments about mœurs one is making judgments about
what is honourable; and the basis for such judgments—the
law that is being applied—is ·public· opinion.
[In this next sentence Rousseau speaks, oddly, of the constitution of
a people. Elsewhere, constitutions are credited to organisms, to man as
such, and to political entities.]

66

A people’s opinions come from its

The Social Contract

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

constitution; although the law does not regulate •mœurs, it’s
legislation that gives •them birth. When legislation grows
weak, mœurs degenerate; but in such cases the judgment of
the censors won’t succeed where the force of the laws has
failed.
It follows, then, that censorship may be useful for preserving mœurs but never for restoring them. Set up censors
while the laws are vigorous; as soon as they weaken, all hope
is gone; no legitimate item retains its force when the laws
have lost theirs.
The censorship upholds mœurs by preventing opinions
from growing corrupt, by preserving their rectitude by applying them wisely, and sometimes even by fixing them when
they are still uncertain. [In that sentence, the ‘they’ in question

ignoring the bad man’s proposal, permitting the drunkards to be disgusting. Before coming to that, he has offered another example (not an
ancient one) of that stretch.]

The use of seconds in duels, which had been carried to
wild extremes in the French kingdom, was done away with
merely by these words in a royal edict: ‘As for those who are
cowards enough to call upon seconds. . . ’. This judgment,
getting in ahead of •the public’s judgment, immediately
decided •it. But when those same edicts tried to pronounce
duelling itself as cowardly (and so it is!), the public didn’t
take this seriously because its mind was already made up
the other way.

8. Civic religion

seems to be mœurs, not opinions.]

I have said elsewhere. . . .that as public opinion isn’t
subject to any constraint, there needn’t be any trace of it in
the tribunal set up to represent it. It’s impossible to admire
too much the skill with which the Romans and (even more)
the Spartans used this resource, which we moderns have
wholly lost.
When a man with bad mœurs made a good proposal in the
Spartan Council, the Ephors ignored it and arranged for the
same proposal to be made by a virtuous citizen. What a disgrace for one man, and what an honour for the other, without
either of them being blamed or praised! Certain drunkards
from Samos. . . .polluted the tribunal of the Ephors; the next
day a public edict gave Samians permission to be disgusting.
An actual punishment would have been less severe than
such a ‘permission’! When Sparta has pronounced on what
is or isn’t right, Greece doesn’t appeal against its judgments.

At first men had no kings except the gods, and no government except theocracy. They reasoned like Caligula—·a
Roman emperor who thought he was a god·—and at that
period the reasoning was correct. Men’s thoughts and
feelings have to go through a long period of change before
they can bring themselves to take their equals as masters
and to expect to profit by doing so.
Simply from the fact that God was put in charge of every
political society, it followed that there were as many gods as
peoples. Two peoples that were strangers to one another, and
nearly always enemies, couldn’t go on recognising the same
master for long; two armies giving battle couldn’t obey the
same leader. So national divisions led to polytheism, which
in turn led to •theological and •civil intolerance—which, as
I’ll show later, are essentially the same.
The Greeks’ liking for discovering their gods among •the
barbarians arose from their regarding themselves as the
natural sovereigns of •those peoples. But it’s our own times
that have produced the line of ‘scholarship’ that is based on

[In the preceding paragraph, Rousseau is evidently stretching the notion
of censorship [see Glossary] as ancient Rome had it, to cover anything
official that nudges or hooks into public opinion in some oblique way:

without parallel till the coming of Christianity.26
Thus, because every religion was attached solely to the
laws of the state that prescribed it, the only way to convert
a people was to enslave it, and the only missionaries there
could be were conquerors. . . . So far from men fighting for the
gods, the gods (as in Homer) fought for men; each man asked
his god for victory, and paid for it with new altars. Before
the Romans took a place, they called on its gods to abandon
it; and when they left the Tarentines with their outraged
gods, they regarded those gods as subject to their own and
forced to do them homage. They left the vanquished their
gods as they left them their laws. A wreath to the Jupiter of
the Capitol was often the only tribute they imposed.
Finally, when the Romans in spreading their empire had
also spread their forms of worship and their gods, and had
often adopted for themselves the gods of the vanquished,
granting the rights of the city to both lots of gods, the peoples
of that vast empire very gradually came to have multitudes
of gods and forms of worship, everywhere almost the same;
and that’s how it came about that paganism throughout the
known world finally came to be a single religion.
This was the situation when Jesus came to set up on
earth a spiritual kingdom, which, by separating the theological from the political system, destroyed the unity of the state,
and caused the internal divisions that have never ceased to
trouble Christian peoples. This new idea of a kingdom of ‘the
other world’ could never have occurred to pagans, so they
always regarded the Christians as really rebels, who while
pretending to be submissive were only waiting for the chance
to become independent and to be in charge, cunningly seizing
the authority they pretended in their weakness to respect.
This was the cause of the persecutions.

identifying gods of one nation with gods of another. As if
Moloch, Saturn, and Chronos could be the same god! As if
the Phoenician Baal, the Greek Zeus, and the Latin Jupiter
could be the same! As if there could be any common residue
in imaginary beings with different names!
You may ask: ‘Why were there no wars of religion in the
pagan world, where each state had its own form of worship
[culte ] and its own gods?’ My reply is that just because
each state had its own form of worship as well as its own
government, no state distinguished its gods from its laws.
Political war was also theological war; the gods had, so to
speak, provinces that were fixed by the boundaries of nations.
The god of one people had no right over other peoples. The
gods of the pagans were not jealous gods [= ‘didn’t demand that
their followers have nothing to do with any other gods’]; they shared
the world among themselves. Even Moses and the Hebrews
sometimes adopted that point of view by speaking of ‘the
God of Israel’. It’s true that they regarded as powerless the
gods of the Canaanites, a proscribed people condemned to
destruction, whose place they were to take; but look at how
they spoke of the divinities of the neighbouring peoples they
were forbidden to attack! ‘Isn’t the territory belonging to
your god Chemosh lawfully yours?’ said Jephthah to the
Ammonites. ‘We have the same title to the lands that our
conquering God has made his own’ (Judges 11:24). . . . Here,
I think, there is a recognition that the rights of Chemosh are
on a par with those of the God of Israel.
When the Jews were subjects of the Kings of Babylon and
then of the Kings of Syria, they still obstinately refused to
recognise any god but their own; this refusal was regarded
as rebellion against their conqueror, and drew down on
them the persecutions we read of in their history, which are
26

It is utterly clear that the so-called ’Sacred war’ against the Phocians was not a war of religion. Its aim was to punish acts of sacrilege, not to conquer
unbelievers.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau

What the pagans had feared took place. Then everything
was re-arranged: the humble Christians changed their way
of talking, and soon this so-called kingdom of •the other
world turned, under a visible leader, into the most violent
despotism in •this world.
However, as there was always •a prince and civil laws ·as
well as •a church·, this double power created a conflict of
jurisdiction that made it impossible for Christian states to be
governed well; and men never managed to discover whether
they were obliged to obey the master or the priest.
Several peoples, however, even in Europe and its neighbourhood, have tried to preserve or restore the old system—
tried and failed, because the spirit of Christianity has won
every time. The sacred cult has always remained or again
become independent of the sovereign and not essentially
linked with the body of the state. Mahomet held very sound
and sensible views, and made a good job of linking his
political system together; and as long as the caliphs who
succeeded him preserved the form of his government, that
government had the good feature of being one—·a unitary
government, not split between secular and religious powers·.
But when the Arabs became prosperous, lettered, civilised,
slack and cowardly, they were conquered by barbarians, and
the division between the two powers started up again. It is
less conspicuous among the Mahometans than among the
Christians, but the Mahometans do have it, especially in the
sect of Ali, and in some states such as Persia it is continually
making itself felt.
Among us ·Europeans·, the kings of England have been
made heads of the Church, and the Czars have done much

Civic religion

the same thing; but
•this title has made them ministers of the Church
rather than its masters;
•they have acquired the power to maintain the church
rather than to change it;
•they aren’t its legislators, but only its princes.
Wherever the clergy is a corporate body,27 it is master and
legislator in its own country. There are thus two powers, two
sovereigns, in England and in Russia, as well as elsewhere.
[Rousseau shouldn’t have said ‘two sovereigns’. What he has been maintaining is that England has (i) a sovereign and (ii) a government, and
that (i) the body of the Anglican clergy is the sovereign, while (ii) the king
is the government.]

The philosopher Hobbes is the only Christian writer who
has seen the evil and seen how to remedy it, and has dared
to propose bring the two heads of the eagle together again,
restoring the total political unity without which no state
or government will ever be rightly constituted. But he
should have seen that Christianity’s dominating spirit is
incompatible with his system, and that the priests’ side of
the divide would always be stronger than the state’s. What
has drawn down hatred on his political theory is not so much
what is false and terrible in it as what is just and true. . . .
I believe that if the study of history were developed from
this point of view, it would be easy to refute the opinion of
Bayle
that no religion is useful to the body politic,
and also the opposing opinion of Warburton
that Christianity is the body politic’s strongest support.

It should be noted that what binds the clergy together to constitute a body is not a formal assembly but rather the communion of churches.
Communion and excommunication are the clergy’s social compact, a compact that will always make them masters of peoples and kings. All priests
who give or take communion together are fellow-citizens, even if they come from opposite ends of the earth. This invention is a political masterpiece;
pagan priests have nothing like it, which is why they have therefore never constituted a clerical corporate body.

·Starting from the Hobbbesian viewpoint·, we would demon-

4 8.

Civic religion

There’s a third bizarre sort of religion (c) that •gives men
two codes of law, two rulers, and two countries, •imposes
contradictory duties on them, and •makes it impossible for
them to be believers and citizens. The religion of the Lamas
is like that, and so is the religion of the Japanese. Another
example is Roman ·Catholic· Christianity. We could call this
sort of religion the religion of the priest. It leads to a sort of
mixed and anti-social code that has no name ·analogous to
‘natural divine’ and ‘positive divine’ for the other two·.
Looked at from the political point of view, these three
kinds of religion all have defects. (c) is so clearly bad that
•passing the time proving that it is so would be •wasting
time. Anything that destroys social unity is worthless; all
institutions that set man in contradiction to himself are
worthless.
(b) has some good features. It unites divine worship with
love of the laws. By making the country the object of the
citizens’ adoration, it teaches them that service done to the
state is service done to its guardian god. It is a form of
theocracy, in which there should be no pope but the prince,
and no priests but the magistrates. In this system, dying for
one’s country is suffering martyrdom; violating its laws is
sacrilege; and subjecting a criminal to public execration is
condemning him to the anger of the gods. . . .
But it is bad in that, being based on lies and error, it
deceives men, makes them credulous and superstitious, and
drowns the true worship of the Divinity [Rousseau’s phrase]
in empty ceremonies. It is also bad when by becoming
tyrannical and exclusive it makes a people bloodthirsty and
intolerant, breathing murder and massacre, and regarding
as a sacred act the killing of anyone who doesn’t believe in
its gods. This puts such a people into a natural state of war
with everyone else, so that its security is deeply endangered.

strate to Bayle that no state has ever been founded without a
religious basis, and to Warburton that Christian law basically
weakens the state’s constitution more than it helps it. To
make myself understood, I have only to sharpen up a little
the unduly vague ideas of religion that come up in this
subject.
Religion, considered in relation to society, can be divided
into two kinds. (a) With the relevant ‘society’ taken as the
whole of mankind, we have the religion of man; (b) with
‘society’ understood at the society of this or that nation we
have the religion of the citizen of this or that nation. (a)
doesn’t have temples, or altars or rites, and is confined •to
the purely internal worship of the supreme God and •the
eternal obligations of morality; it is the religion of the Gospel
pure and simple, the true theism, what may be called natural divine law. (b) is codified in a single country, to which it
gives its gods and its own patron saints; it has its dogmas,
its rites, and its external forms of worship prescribed by
law; it views all the other nations as unbelievers, foreign,
barbarous; it doesn’t regard the duties and rights of man as
extending far beyond its own altars. The religions of early
peoples were all of this sort. We could label them as civil or
positive divine law.
[In the contrast between natural law and positive law, ‘positive’ means
‘created by the decisions of human beings’. It was a generally understood distinction in early modern times; Rousseau is here using it to
distinguish two kinds of religion, suggesting that one of them is natural—
perhaps an upshot of human nature—whereas the other is artificial,
something deliberately devised or invented by humans. He throws in ‘divine’ because the items under discussion are religions; Rousseau doesn’t
think that any god has anything to do with (b), and the adjective-pair
‘positive divine’, which means ‘man-made and divine’ and is virtually
self-contradictory, is a joke.]

There remains (a) the religion of man, i.e. Christianity—
not today’s Christianity but the entirely different Christianity
of the Gospel. By means of this holy, sublime, and genuine
religion all men, as children of one God, acknowledge one
another as brothers, and the society that unites them isn’t
dissolved even at death.
But this religion, having no special relation to the body
politic, leaves the laws with only the force they draw from
themselves without adding anything to it; which means that
one of the great bonds for uniting the society of the given
country is left idle. Worse: so far from binding the citizens’
hearts to •the state, it detaches them from •that and from all
earthly things. I know of nothing more contrary to the social
spirit.
They tell us that a populace of true Christians would
form the most perfect society imaginable. I see only one
great difficulty about this idea, namely that a society of true
Christians wouldn’t be a society of men.
I go further: such a society, with all its perfection,
wouldn’t be the strongest or the most durable; its very
perfection would deprive it of its bond of union; the flaw
that would destroy it would lie in its perfection.
Everyone would do his duty; the people would be lawabiding; the rulers would be just and temperate, and the
magistrates upright and incorruptible; the soldiers would
regard death as a minor thing; there would be no vanity or
extravagant luxury. So far, so good; but let’s look further.
Christianity is an entirely spiritual religion, occupied
solely with heavenly things; the Christian’s country is not
of this world. He does his duty, certainly, but does it with
a deep lack of interest in whether the work he has put in
has produced good or bad results. Provided he has nothing
to reproach himself with, it doesn’t matters much to him
whether things go well or ill here below. If the state prospers,

he hardly dares to share in the public happiness, for fear he
may become puffed up with pride in his country’s glory; if
the state goes downhill, he blesses the hand of God that is
hard upon His people.
For the society to be peaceable and for harmony to be
maintained, all the citizens would have to be equally good
Christians. If there happened to be a single self-seeker or
hypocrite—a Catiline or a Cromwell, for instance—he would
certainly get the better of his pious compatriots. Christian
charity doesn’t make it easy for a man to think ill of another
man. As soon as our bad man has worked out a way of
•deceiving everyone else and •getting hold of a share in the
public authority, you have
a man established in dignity; God wants us to respect
him.
Then before long, you have
a power; God wants us to obey it.
If the person who has the power abuses it, that is the
whip God uses to punish his children. There would be
scruples about driving out the usurper: it would involve
disturbing public peace, using violence, spilling blood; none
of this squares with Christian gentleness; and anyway what
does it matter in this vale of sorrows whether we are free
men or serfs? The essential thing is to get to heaven, and
resignation—·i.e. putting up with hardship patiently and
without complaining·—is just one more way of getting there.
If a foreign war breaks out, the citizens march readily out
to battle; not one of them thinks of flight; they do their duty,
but they have no passion for victory; they know how to die
better than they know how to conquer. What does it matter
whether they win or lose? Doesn’t Providence know better
than they do what should happen to them? Imagine what
a proud, impetuous and passionate enemy could make of
this ·Christian· stoicism! Set this Christian army against the

back to ·questions about· what is right, and settle our principles on this important point. [In this passage, ‘right’ translates
droit, which can also mean ‘law’.] The right that the social compact
gives the sovereign over the subjects does not, we have
seen, include anything that isn’t good for the public.28 The
subjects then owe the sovereign an account of their opinions
only insofar as the opinions matter to the community. Now,
it matters very much to the community that each citizen
should have a religion that makes him love his duty; but
that religion’s •dogmas are no concern of the state’s or of its
members’ except insofar as •they involve morality and the
believer’s duties towards others. In addition to all that, a
man may have any opinions he likes without that being any
of the sovereign’s business. Having no standing in the other
world, the sovereign has no concern with what may lie in
wait for its subjects in the life to come, provided they are
good citizens in this life.

deep-feeling peoples who were consumed by ardent love of
glory and of their country; imagine your Christian republic
up against Sparta or Rome: the pious Christians will be
beaten, crushed and destroyed, before they know where they
are; or they’ll be safe only because their enemy regarded
them as negligible. . . .
But I’m wrong to speak of a Christian republic—those
two terms are mutually exclusive. Christianity preaches
only servitude and dependence. Its spirit is so favourable
to tyranny that it always profits by such a régime. Genuine
Christians are made to be slaves, and they know it and don’t
much mind: this short life counts for too little in their eyes.
Christian troops are excellent, we are told. I deny it. Show
me an example! For my part, I don’t know of any Christian
troops. The Crusades? Without disputing the courage of the
Crusaders, I answer that far from being Christians they were
the priests’ troops, they were citizens of the Church: they
fought for their spiritual country, which the Church had
somehow made temporal. Properly understood, this goes
back to paganism: because the Gospel doesn’t establish any
national religion, there can’t possibly be a holy war among
Christians.
Under the pagan emperors, the Christian soldiers were
fine; every Christian writer says so, and I believe it; they
were honourably modelling themselves on the pagan troops.
As soon as the emperors were Christian, this modelling was
extinguished; and when the cross had driven out the eagle,
Roman valour wholly disappeared.
Let us now set political considerations aside and come

So there’s a purely civil profession of faith, the content
of which should be fixed by the sovereign—not exactly as
religious dogmas, but as social sentiments that are needed
for to be a good citizen and a faithful subject.29 While it can’t
compel anyone to believe them, it can banish from the state
anyone who doesn’t believe them—banishing him not for
impiety but for being anti-social, incapable of truly loving the
laws and justice, and if necessary sacrificing his life to his
duty. If anyone publicly recognises these dogmas and then
behaves as if he doesn’t believe them, let him be punished
by death: he has committed the worst of all crimes—lying
before the law.

‘In the republic,’ says the Marquis d’Argenson, ‘each man is perfectly free in what doesn’t harm others.’ That is the invariable limit; I can’t define it
more exactly. . . .
Caesar, arguing for the defence in Catiline’s trial, tried to establish the dogma that the soul is mortal. Cato and Cicero, speaking for the prosecution,
didn’t waste time in philosophising, and simply argued that Caesar had spoken like a bad citizen, pushing a doctrine that would be harmful to the
state. That, and not a problem of theology, was what the Roman senate had to judge.

The dogmas of civil religion ought to be few, simple, and

exclusive national religions, tolerance should be given to
all •religions that tolerate others, so long as •their dogmas
contain nothing contrary to the duties of citizenship. Anyone
who ventures to say: ‘Outside the Church is no salvation’
should be driven from the state, unless the state is the
Church and the prince the pope. Such a dogma is good
only in a theocratic government; in any other it is fatal. The
reason Henry IV is said to have had for embracing the Roman
religion—·namely that the Roman Catholics did, while the
Protestants didn’t, say ‘Our faith is the only possible route to
heaven’·—ought to make every honest man leave it, especially
any prince who knows how to reason.

•the existence of a mighty, intelligent and beneficent

Divinity, possessed of foresight and providence,
•the life to come,
•the happiness of the just,
•the punishment of the wicked,
•the sanctity of the social contract and the laws.
And just one dogma of exclusion, namely the exclusion of
intolerance, which is a feature of the cults we have rejected.
Those who distinguish •civil from •theological intolerance
are, to my mind, mistaken. The two intolerances are inseparable. You can’t possibly live at peace with people you regard
as damned; loving them would be hating God who punishes
them: we absolutely must either reform them or torment
them. Wherever theological intolerance is admitted, it must
inevitably have some civil effect;30 and as soon as it does the
sovereign is no longer sovereign even in the temporal sphere;
from then on, priests are the real masters, and kings only
their ministers.

9. Conclusion
Now that I have laid down the true principles of political
right, and tried to plant the state on its own base, the next
task would be to strengthen it by its foreign relations. That
would bring in the law of nations, commerce, the right of war
and conquest, public law, leagues, negotiations, treaties, etc.
But all this adds up to a new subject that is far too vast for
my narrow scope. As it is, I have ranged further afield than I
ought to have.

Marriage, for instance, being a civil contract, has civil effects without which society can’t even subsist. Now, suppose that the clergy collectively
claim the sole right of permitting this act, a right that every intolerant religion is bound to claim. Isn’t it obvious that in establishing the Church’s
authority in this respect, it will be destroying the prince’s, letting him now have only as many subjects as the clergy are willing to allow him? Being
in a position to marry or not to marry people according to

•their acceptance of such and such a doctrine,
•their admission or rejection of such and such a formula,
•their greater or less piety,
isn’t it obvious that if the Church is prudent and firm it can come to have sole control of all inheritances, offices and citizens, and even of the state
itself? ·Doing all this through marriage? But what if people don’t marry but have children all the same? That is not a solution, because· the state
couldn’t survive if it were composed entirely of bastards. ‘But’, I shall be told, ‘people can appeal on the grounds of abuse, create delays, issue
decrees, work the controls of the whole temporal (see Glossary) legal machine.’ How pathetic! The clergy will take no notice and go its way; to do this
it won’t even need courage, merely a little good sense. It will calmly allow appeals, delays, decrees and seizings of the controls, and still end up as
the master. It is not, I think, a great sacrifice to give up a part, when one is sure of securing all.

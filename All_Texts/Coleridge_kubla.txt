Kubla K han
Samuel Taylor Coleridge

background Coleridge wrote “Kubla Khan” in 1797 after taking opium
prescribed to relieve pain. Affected by the powerful narcotic, he fell into a deep
sleep while reading about the 13th-century Mongol emperor Kublai Khan. In his
sleep, he composed 200 to 300 lines based on fantastic images that rose up as
he dreamed. Awakening hours later, Coleridge began to write the poem down,
but a visitor interrupted him, and later Coleridge could not recall the rest of the
lines. He called the poem “a fragment” and “a vision in a dream.”

In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure dome decree:
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
Through caverns measureless to man
Down to a sunless sea.
So twice five miles of fertile ground
With walls and towers were girdled round:
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
And here were forests ancient as the hills,
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery. a

But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
A savage place! as holy and enchanted
As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted
By woman wailing for her demon lover!
And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,
A mighty fountain momently was forced:
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail:
And ’mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
It flung up momently the sacred river.

1 Xanadu (zBnPE-dLQ): Shangdu, one
of Kublai Khan’s residences in what is
now northern China.

8 sinuous rills: winding streams.

a SOUND DEVICES

Read lines 1–11 aloud. What
sound devices do you notice, and
what mood do they help create?
13 athwart a cedarn cover: across a
grove of cedar trees.

19 momently: at every moment.
20 intermitted: interrupted.

22 chaffy . . . flail: grain being beaten
to separate it from its husks, or chaff.

Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,
Then reached the caverns measureless to man,
And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean: b
And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far
Ancestral voices prophesying war!
The shadow of the dome of pleasure
Floated midway on the waves;
Where was heard the mingled measure
From the fountain and the caves.
It was a miracle of rare device,
A sunny pleasure dome with caves of ice!

A damsel with a dulcimer
In a vision once I saw:
It was an Abyssinian maid,
And on her dulcimer she played,
Singing of Mount Abora.
Could I revive within me
Her symphony and song,
To such a deep delight ’twould win me,
That with music loud and long, c
I would build that dome in air,
That sunny dome! those caves of ice!
And all who heard should see them there,
And all should cry, Beware! Beware!
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!
Weave a circle round him thrice,
And close your eyes with holy dread,
For he on honeydew hath fed,
And drunk the milk of Paradise.

E. M. Cioran

Translated by

Richard Howard

Disaster, according to the caustically
brilliant philosopher E. M. Cioran, lies
not in the prospect of our deaths, but
in the fact of our birth, that ‘laughable
accident’. In these pessimistic, nihilistic
and darkly funny aphorisms, he strips the
human condition down to its most basic
and grapples with questions such as the
passing of time, our inability to live in the
world or just how to make ourselves get
out of bed in the morning.

The Trouble with Being Born
E. M. Cioran (1911–​­1995) was one of Central Europe’s most remarkable
philosophers, whose thinking was influenced by pessimism and exist­
entialism. A Romanian, he lived most of his life in Paris. His major
works in Romanian include On the Heights of Despair and, in French,
A Short History of Decay (also published in Penguin Modern Classics)
and Drawn and Quartered. He refused nearly every literary prize he was
awarded.
Richard Howard (b. 1929) is an American poet, critic and translator.
He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his poetry collection Untitled
Subjects, and the PEN Translation Prize for his translation of E. M.
Cioran’s A Short History of Decay. Howard has translated more than
150 works from French into English.

Three in the morning. I realize this second, then this one, then
the next: I draw up the balance sheet for each minute. And
why all this? Because I was born. It is a special type of sleeplessness that produces the indictment of birth.
§

‘Ever since I was born’ – ​that since has a resonance so dreadful
to my ears it becomes unendurable.
§

There is a kind of knowledge that strips whatever you do
of weight and scope: for such knowledge, everything is without basis except itself. Pure to the point of abhorring even the
notion of an object, it translates that extreme science according
to which doing or not doing something comes down to the
same thing and is accompanied by an equally extreme satisfaction: that of being able to rehearse, each time, the discovery
that any gesture performed is not worth defending, that
­nothing is enhanced by the merest vestige of substance, that
‘reality’ falls within the province of lunacy. Such knowledge
deserves to be called posthumous: it functions as if the knower
were alive and not alive, a being and the memory of a being.
‘It’s already in the past,’ he says about all he achieves, even as he
achieves it, thereby forever destitute of the present.

§

We do not rush toward death, we flee the catastrophe of birth,
survivors struggling to forget it. Fear of death is merely the
projection into the future of a fear which dates back to our first
moment of life.
We are reluctant, of course, to treat birth as a scourge: has it
not been inculcated as the sovereign ​­good – ​have we not been
told that the worst came at the end, not at the outset of our
lives? Yet evil, the real evil, is behind, not ahead of us. What
escaped Jesus did not escape Buddha: ‘If three things did not
exist in the world, O disciples, the Perfect One would not appear
in the world . . .’ And ahead of old age and death he places the
fact of birth, source of every infirmity, every disaster.
§

We can endure any truth, however destructive, provided it
replaces everything, provided it affords as much vitality as the
hope for which it substitutes.
§

I do nothing, granted. But I see the hours pass
​­
– ​which is ­better
than trying to fill them.
§

No need to elaborate ​­works – ​merely say something that can be
murmured in the ear of a drunkard or a dying man.
§

Nothing is a better proof of how far humanity has regressed
than the impossibility of finding a single nation, a single tribe,
among whom birth still provokes mourning and lamentations.
§

The Trouble with Being Born

To defy heredity is to defy billions of years, to defy the first cell.
§

There is a god at the outset, if not at the end, of every joy.
§

Never comfortable in the immediate, I am lured only by what
precedes me, what distances me from here, the numberless
moments when I was not: the non-​­
​­
born.
§

Physical need of dishonor. How I should have liked to be the
executioner’s son!
§

What right have you to pray for me? I need no intercessor,
I shall manage alone. The prayers of a wretch I might accept,
but no one else’s, not even a saint’s. I cannot bear your bothering about my salvation. If I apprehend salvation and flee it, your
prayers are merely an indiscretion. Invest them elsewhere; in
any case, we do not serve the same gods. If mine are impotent,
there is every reason to believe yours are no less so. Even assuming they are as you imagine them, they would still lack the
power to cure me of a horror older than my memory.
§

What misery a sensation is! Ecstasy itself, perhaps, is nothing
more.
§

Unmaking, decreating, is the only task man may take upon
himself, if he aspires, as everything suggests, to distinguish
himself from the Creator.

§

I know that my birth is fortuitous, a laughable accident, and yet,
as soon as I forget myself, I behave as if it were a capital event,
indispensable to the progress and equilibrium of the world.
§

To have committed every crime but that of being a father.
§

As a general rule, men expect disappointment: they know they
must not be impatient, that it will come sooner or later, that it
will hold off long enough for them to proceed with their
undertakings of the moment. The disabused man is different:
for him, disappointment occurs at the same time as the deed;
he has no need to await it, it is present. By freeing himself
from succession, he has devoured the possible and rendered
the future superfluous. ‘I cannot meet you in your future,’ he
says to the others. ‘We do not have a single moment in common.’ Because for him the whole of the future is already here.
When we perceive the end in the beginning, we move faster
than time. Illumination, that lightning disappointment, affords
a certitude which transforms disillusion into deliverance.
§

I disentangle myself from appearances, yet I am snarled in them
nonetheless; or rather: I am halfway between these appearances
and that which invalidates them, that which has neither name
nor content, that which is nothing and everything. I shall never
take the decisive step outside them; my nature forces me to drift,
to remain forever in the equivocal, and if I were to attempt a
clean break in one direction or the other, I should ­perish by my
salvation.

§

My faculty for disappointment surpasses understanding. It is
what lets me comprehend Buddha, but also what keeps me
from following him.
§

What we can no longer commiserate with counts for nothing
​­
–​
no longer exists. We realize why our past so quickly stops being
‘ours’ and turns into history, something which no longer concerns anyone.
§

In the deepest part of yourself, aspire to be as dispossessed, as
lamentable as God.
§

True contact between beings is established only by mute presence, by apparent ​­non-​­communication, by that mysterious and
wordless exchange which resembles inward prayer.
§

What I know at sixty, I knew as well at twenty. Forty years of a
long, a superfluous, labor of verification.
§

I am for the most part so convinced that everything is lacking
in basis, consequence, justification, that if someone dared to
contradict me, even the man I most admire, he would seem to
me a charlatan or a fool.
§

Even in childhood I watched the hours flow, independent of

any reference, any action, any event, the disjunction of time
from what was not itself, its autonomous existence, its special
status, its empire, its tyranny. I remember quite clearly that
afternoon when, for the first time, confronting the empty universe, I was no more than a passage of moments reluctant to go
on playing their proper parts. Time was coming unstuck from​
­being – ​at my expense.
§

Unlike Job, I have not cursed the day I was born; all the other
days, on the contrary, I have covered with my anathemas . . .
§

If death had only negative aspects, dying would be an unmanageable action.
§

Everything exists; nothing exists. Either formula affords a like
serenity. The man of anxiety, to his misfortune, remains
between them, trembling and perplexed, forever at the mercy
of a nuance, incapable of gaining a foothold in the security of
being or in the absence of being.
§

Here on the coast of Normandy, at this hour of the morning, I
needed no one. The very gulls’ presence bothered me: I drove
them off with stones. And hearing their supernatural shrieks,
I realized that that was just what I wanted, that only the Sinister could soothe me, and that it was for such a confrontation
that I had got up before dawn.

‘In this our life’ – ​to be in life: suddenly I am struck by the
strangeness of such an expression, as if it applied to no one.
§

Whenever I flag and feel sorry for my brain, I am carried away
by an irresistible desire to proclaim. That is the moment I realize the paltry depths out of which rise reformers, prophets, and
saviors.
§

I long to be ​­f ree – ​desperately free. Free as the stillborn are free.
§

If there is so much discomfort and ambiguity in lucidity, it is
because lucidity is the result of the poor use to which we have
put our sleepless nights.
§

Our obsession with birth, by shifting us to a point before our
past, robs us of our pleasure in the future, in the present, and
even in the past.
§

Rare are the days when, projected into post-​­
​­
history, I fail to witness the gods’ hilarity at leaving behind the human episode.
What we need is an alternate vision, when that of the Last
Judgment no longer satisfies anyone.
§

An idea, a being, anything which becomes incarnate loses identity, turns grotesque. Frustration of all achievement. Never
quit the possible, wallow in eternal trifling, forget to be born.

§

The real, the unique misfortune: to see the light of day. A disaster which dates back to aggressiveness, to the seed of expansion and rage within origins, to the tendency to the worst
which first shook them up.
§

When we see someone again after many years, we should sit
down facing each other and say nothing for hours, so that by
means of silence our consternation can relish itself.
§

Days of miraculous sterility. Instead of rejoicing over them,
proclaiming victory, transforming this drought into a celebration, seeing it as an illustration of my fulfillment, my maturity,
in short my detachment, I let myself be invaded by spite and
resentment: so tenacious is the old Adam in us, the bustling
canaille, unfit for ​­self-​­effacement.
§

I am enraptured by Hindu philosophy, whose essential
endeavor is to surmount the self; and everything I do, everything I think is only myself and the self’s humiliations.
§

While we are performing an action, we have a goal; performed,
the action has no more reality for us than the goal we were
seeking. Nothing of much consequence ​­here – ​no more than a
game. But some of us are conscious of this game in the course of
the action: we experience the conclusion in the premises, the
achieved in the ​­virtual – ​we undermine ‘seriousness’ by the
very fact that we exist.

The Trouble with Being Born

The vision of ​­non-​­reality, of universal default, is the product
of an everyday sensation and a sudden frisson. Everything is a​
­game – ​without such a revelation, the sensation we haul through
our usual lives would not have that characteristic stamp our
metaphysical experiences require to be distinguished from
their imitations, our discomforts. For every discomfort is only
an abortive metaphysical experience.
§

When we have worn out the interest we once took in death,
when we realize we have nothing more to gain from it, we fall
back on birth, we turn to a much more inexhaustible abyss.
§

At this very moment, I am ​­suffering – ​as we say in French, j’ai
mal. This event, crucial for me, is nonexistent, even inconceivable for anyone else, for everyone else. Except for God, if that
word can have a meaning.
§

We hear on all sides, that if everything is pointless, to do well
whatever it is you’re doing is not. Yet it is, even so. To reach this
conclusion, and to endure it, you need ply no trade, or at most,
a king’​­s – ​say, Solomon’s.
§

I react like everyone else, even like those I most despise; but I
make up for it by deploring every action I commit, good or bad.
§

Where are my sensations? They have melted into . . . me,
and what is this me, this self, but the sum of these evaporated
sensations?

§

Extraordinary and ​­null – ​these two adjectives apply to the sexual
act, and, consequently, to everything resulting from it, to life
first of all.
§

Lucidity is the only vice which makes us ​­free – f​ ree in a desert.
§

As the years pass, the number of those we can communicate
with diminishes. When there is no longer anyone to talk to, at
last we will be as we were before stooping to a name.
§

Once we reject lyricism, to blacken a page becomes an ordeal:
what’s the use of writing in order to say exactly what we had to
say?
§

We cannot consent to be judged by someone who has suffered
less than ourselves. And since each of us regards himself as an
unrecognized Job . . .
§

I dream of an ideal confessor to tell everything to, spill it all: I
dream of a blasé saint.
§

After all the ages of dying, the living must have learned the
trick; how else explain how the insect, the rodent, and man
himself have managed, after a little fuss, to do it so properly?

Paradise was unendurable, otherwise the first man would have
adapted to it; this world is no less so, since here we regret paradise or anticipate another one. What to do? where to go? Do
nothing and go nowhere, easy enough.
§

Health is certainly a good thing; but those who possess it have
been denied the opportunity of realizing it, for ​­self-​­conscious
health is either compromised or about to be. Since no one
delights in his absence of infirmities, we may speak without
exaggeration of a just punishment of the healthy.
§

Some have misfortunes; others, obsessions. Which are worse off?
§

Don’t be fair to me: I can do without everything but the tonic
of injustice.
§

‘All is suffering’ – ​modernized, the Buddhist expression runs:
‘All is nightmare.’
Thereby, nirvana, whose mission now is to end a much
more widespread torment, is no longer a recourse reserved to
the few but becomes as universal as nightmare itself.
§

What is that one crucifixion compared to the daily kind any
insomniac endures?
§

I was walking late one night along a tree-​­
​­
lined path; a chestnut
fell at my feet. The noise it made as it burst, the resonance it

provoked in me, and an upheaval out of all proportion to this
insignificant event thrust me into miracle, into the rapture
of the definitive, as if there were no more questions
​­
– ​only
answers. I was drunk on a thousand unexpected discoveries,
none of which I could make use of . . .
This is how I nearly reached the Supreme. But instead I went
on with my walk.
§

We tell our troubles to someone only to make him suffer, to
make him assume them for himself. If we wanted to win him
over, we would admit none but abstract worries, the only kind
those who love us are eager to hear.
§

I do not forgive myself for being born. It is as if, creeping into
this world, I had profaned a mystery, betrayed some momentous pledge, committed a fault of nameless gravity. Yet in a less
assured mood, birth seems a calamity I would be miserable not
having known.
§

Thought is never innocent, for it is pitiless, it is aggressive, it
helps us burst our bonds. Were we to suppress what is evil and
even demonic in thought, we should have to renounce the very
concept of deliverance.
§

The surest way of not being deceived is to undermine one certainty after the next. Yet the fact remains that everything that
matters was accomplished outside doubt.

The late war, awakening all the primitive racial fury of the

in a belated and unexpected embrace, to the horror, I daresay, of the Kaiser, and perhaps to the

even greater horror of Nietzsche’s own ghost.

The folks of Anglo-Saxondom, with their equally
characteristic tendency to explain all their enter-

prises romantically, simultaneously set him up as

the Antichrist he no doubt secretly longed to be.

The result was a great deal of misrepresentation
and misunderstanding of him. From the pulpits
of the allied countries, and particularly from
those of England and the United States, a horde
of patriotic ecclesiastics denounced

him in ex-

travagant terms as the author of all the horrors of
the time, and in the newspapers, until the Kaiser

was elected sole bugaboo, he shared the honors of

But under all this alarmed and preposterous

But in all this justifiable fear, of course, there

from below.

His plain aim in

“The Antichrist” was to combat that menace by
completing the work begun, on the one hand, by

Darwin and the other evolutionist philosophers,
and, on the other hand, by German historians and
philologians.

The net effect of this earlier at-

tack, in the eighties,

had been the collapse of

Christian theology as a serious concern of edu-

cated men.

The mob, it must be obvious, was

very little shaken; even to this day it has not put

— 18 —

INTRODUCTION
off its belief in the essential Christian doctrines.

But the intelligentsia, by 1885, had been pretty
well convinced.

No man of sound information,

at the time Nietzsehe planned

“The Antichrist,”

actually believed that the world

was created in

seven days, or that its fauna was once overwhelmed by a flood as a penalty for the sins of
man, or that Noah saved the boa constrictor, the
prairie dog and the pediculus capitis by taking
a pair of each into the ark, or that Lot’s wife was

turned into a pillar of salt, or that a fragment of
the True Cross could cure hydrophobia.

Belief in them had

become a mark of inferiority, like the allied belief in madstones, magic and apparitions.

But though the theology of Christianity had

ancient caste of sacerdotal parasites, the ethics

an absolutely new Christian cult

purged of all the supematuralism super-

imposed upon the older cult by generations of
theologians,

and harking back to what was con-

found one’s self in revolt against the established

and began to understand Jesus as in re-

volt against the established order.

Until then

this militant, this nay-saying, nay-doing element

in his character had been lacking; what is more,

he had appeared

to present its opposite.

Ob-

viously, the little community had not understood

what was precisely the most important thing of
all: the example offered by this

way of dying, the

freedom from and superiority to every feeling
of ressentiment

—a

plain indication of how little

he was understood at all!

All that Jesus could

hope to accomplish by his death, in itself, was

— 115 —

THE ANTICHRIST
to offer tile strongest possible proof, or example,

of his teachings in the most public manner.

.

.

.

But his disciples were very far from forgiving
his death

—though

to

have done so would have

accorded with the Gospels in the highest degree;

and neither were they prepared to offer themselves, with gentle and serene calmness of heart,

for a similar death.

.

.

.

On the contrary, it was

precisely the most unevangelical of feelings, re-

venge, that now possessed them.

It

seemed im-

possible that the cause should perish with his

death:

“recompense” and “judgment” became

necessary

(

—

yet what could be less evangelical

than “recompense,” “punishment,” and “sitting
in judgment”!).

Once more the popular belief

in the coming of a messiah appeared in the fore-

ground attention was rivetted upon an historical
;

moment: the “kingdom of God” is to come, with
judgment upon his enemies.
But in all this
.

.

.

there was a wholesale misunderstanding: imagine
the “kingdom of God” as a last act, as a mere

promise!

The Gospels had been, in fact, the in-

carnation, the fulfilment, the realization of this

“kingdom of God.”

by

Jesus, of the equal right of all men to be children

of God: their revenge took the form of elevating
Jesus in an extravagant fashion, and thus separating him

from themselves: just as, in earlier

times, the Jews, to revenge themselves upon their

enemies, separated themselves from their God,

and placed him on a great height.

The One God

and the Only Son of God: both were products
of ressentiment.

grey-beards and saints have a way of being gallant to women that it would be impossible, per-

that the law has stood unchanged from time im-

against one’s forefathers to bring it into question.

The authority of the law is thus grounded on the
thesis:
God gave it, and the fathers lived it.
The higher motive of such procedure lies in the
design to distract consciousness, step by step,
from its concern with notions of right living (that
is to

say, those that have been proved to be right

by wide and carefully considered experience),
so that instinct attains to a perfect automatism

Giambattista

Bodoni

a celebrated
Italian scholar and printer. Bodoni planned his type especially
for use on the more smoothly finished
papers that came into vogue late in the
eighteenth century and drew his letters

with a mechanical regularity that is readily
apparent on comparison with the less formal
old style. Other characteristics that will be noted
are the square serifs without fillet and the marked
contrast between the light and heavy strokes,

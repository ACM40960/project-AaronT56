Translator's Note

The thought of P ierre Hadot is based on a lifetime's study of, and meditation
upon, ancient Greek and Latin philosophical texts. In the course of this long
period, he has, of course, developed his own methodology for the study of
such texts. Based as it is on the methods of his own teachers, such as Paul
Henry and Pierre Courcelle, 1 this method is distinctly his own, and he has
transmitted it to a whole generation of French scholars in the field of late
antique thought.
The first stage of Hadot's method is a scrupulous, textually critical reading of
the original texts, followed by an equally exacting translation of these texts into
French. 2 Only on the foundation of the intense, detailed confrontation with the
text which real translation demands, Hadot feels, can one begin the processes of
exegesis, interpretation, and, perhaps, criticism. Thus, Hadot's thought is, at least
to a large extent, based on his methods of translation. This being the case, it is
impossible to understand the former without understanding the latter.
Such a situation presents obvious difficulties for Hadot's translators. Given
the importance he accords to the study of ancient texts, Hadot tends to quote
them frequently and extensively, in his own translations from the Greek, the
Latin, and the German. Now, a translator's normal procedure would be to dig
up the already existing English translations of the respective texts, and insert
th em where Hadot's own translations had stood in the original. After much
consultation, we have found this method inadequate, for the following reasons:
Many existing English translations are themselves inadequate; some are old
and outdated; others based on different textual readings from those
adopted by Hadot. In the case of still others, finally, no English translation
exists at all.

2 There is no such thing

as an "objective translation." All ttanslators base their

work on their own conception of what their author was trying to say.
Naturally, Hadot has often arrived at views of what his authors meant which

differ from those of the various other ttanslators; his own translations
consequently differ, sometimes fundamentally, from the existing J<:ngl ish
versions.3

vii

Translator's Note

3 The use of existing English translations would often make Hadot's thought
impossible to understand. If we were to insert, for example, a 60-year-old
English translation of, say, Marcus Aurelius into the text, and then follow
it with Hadot's explanation of the passage, the result would be ludicrously
incoherent. Most importantly, it would make it impossible for the reader
to gain any notion of the genesis and development of Hadot's thought which is, after all, the goal of this publication. As I have said, the origin
of Hadot's thought is to be sought in his interpretation of ancient texts,
and his translations of these texts are both the result and an integral part
of his hermeneutical method. Deprived of his translations, we could simply
not see how Hadot had arrived at his particular interpretations of particular
ancient texts, and consequently we would be at a loss to understand the
conclusions he has based on these interpretations.

I have chosen to follow in the translation
is the following: in the case of each of Hadot's quotations

This being the case, the method
of Spiritual Exercises

of passages in Greek, Latin, or German, I have begun by a simple English
translation of Hadot's French version. I have then checked the result against
the original Greek, Latin, or German. If the English translation of Hadot's
version, read on its own, then seemed to me to be a good translation of the
original text, I let it stand; if not, I modified it slightly, with two goals in mind:
first, to bring it into accord with modern English usage; secondly, to make sure
the English transmitted, as far as possible, all the nuances of the original
languages. In cases of particular difficulty, I have benefited from Hadot's
thoughtful advice an d comments, partly by correspondence, and partly during
the course of a memorable stay at the Hadot's home in the summer of

1991.4

The resulting translations therefore often bear little resemblance to existing
English translation; this is especially so in the case of authors like Plato,
Marcus Aurelius, and Plotinus, to whom M. Hadot has devoted a lifetime
of study. Nevertheless, we have decided to include references to the
most accessible -

not necessarily the best

- extant English translations, in case

the interested reader should care to consult the ancient authors cited in this
hook.
Such a method is, obviously, more time-consuming than the usual slapdash
method of translation. My hope is that the result justifies the delays incurred:
I would like to think the result is a scholarly and above all faithful version of
1-lndot's thought.

for completely new translations of those thinkers who have particularly occupied
his attention: Plotinus, Marcus Aurelius, Marius Victorinus, etc.
3 This is so even in the case of so eminent a student of Plotinus, and so
conscientious a translator, as A.H. Armstrong. Although he, too, has devoted a
lifetime of careful study to Plotinus, he often reaches conclusions in the
interpretation of particular Plotinian passages which differ from those of Hadot.
The reason for this is not hard to seek: Plotinus is an extremely difficult author,
and his writings are susceptible of many different interpretations.

gratitude for the Hadots' wonderful hospitality.

Introduction: Pie"e Hadot and the Spiritual
Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy

I believe it

was in 1982 that Michel Foucault first mentioned Pierre Hadot to

me. Struck by Foucault's enthusiasm, I photocopied a number of Hadot's
articles, but, to my regret, never got around to reading them until several
years after Foucault's death . I immediately understood, and shared, Fou­
cault's excitement, for Hadot's work exhibits that rare combination of
prodigious historical scholarship and rigorous philosophical argumentation
that u psets any preconceived distinction between -the h1story--of phDosophy
and philosqphy proper. Expressed in a lucid prose whose clarity and precision
urc remarkable, Hadot's work stands as a model for how to write the history

of philosophy. This collection of essays will, I hope, help to make his work
better known in the English-speaking world; the depth and richness of his

writing contain lessons not only for specialists in ancient philosophy, but for

nil of us interested in the history of philosophical thought.
Pierre Hadot has spent most of his academic career at the

E cole pratique

dL•s Hautes Etudcs and at the College de France. Appointed a directeur d 'etudes
o f the fi fth section of the Ecole in 1964, Hadot occupied a chair in Latin
Pntristics, where he gave extraordinary lectures, many of which remain

unpublished, on, among other topics, the works of Ambrose and Augustine.
In 1972, in response to Hadot's interest in and work on non-Christian
I houl{ht, the title of his chair was changed to "Theologies and Mysticisms of

I lcllcnistic Greece and the End of Antiquity. " Hadot gave courses on Plotinus
111111 M11rcus Aurelius, but also began to devote increased attention to more
Ml'ncrnl them e s in the history of ancient philosophical and theological thought.

In Fdnunry 1983 he assumed the chair of the History of Hellenistic and
Runum Thought at the College de France. He has published translations of
1111d ,·onu11cn111rics on Marius Vic torin us, Porphyry, Ambrose, Plotinus, and

Introduction

topic of major significance, and constitute nothing less than a general
perspective, both methodologically and substantively, on how to approach and
understand the development of the entire history of ancient thought. A
reading of Hadot's complete corpus of writings reveals, as one might expect,
important essays on the history of medieval philosophy, but also, perhaps
more surprisingly, brilliant" contributions to our understanding of Goethe,
Nietzsche, and Wittgenstein. Hadot has also been increasingly preoccupied
with the pertinence of ancient thought for philosophy today, recogmzing that
ancient experience raises questions that we cannot an d should not overlook or
ignore.
This collection of essays is based on the second edition of Exercfres spiritue/s
el philosophic antique, originally published in 1 987 and now out of print.1 But
it also includes a number of essays that were written subsequent to the book,
essays that take up, develop, and extend the themes of E:rercices spiritttels.
Moreover, Hadot has made revisions in some of the chapters for their
inclusion in this volume, and he has rewritten his discussion of Marcus
Aurelius in light of his commentary on the Meditations. 2 Thus this collection
represents an expanded discussion of the topics of spiritual exercises and
ancient philosophy.
In my introduction, I shall not summarize the individual essays. Rather, I
shall try to indicate the general orientation of Hadot's thought, as well as
relate these essays to other questions and problems - methodological,
historical, and philosophical - treated elsewhere by Hadot. Instead of
concentrating on questions of detail, I shall try to highlight some of the
philosophical lessons and insights offered to us by Hadot's work.

Method and Practices of Interpretation in the History of
Ancient Philosophy and Theology

In the summary of his work prepared for his candidacy at the College de
France, Hadot wrote:
The problems, the themes, the symbols from which Western thought
has developed were not all born, quite obviously, in the period that we
have studied. But the West has received them for the most part in the
form that was given to them either by Hellenistic thought, or by the
adaptation of this thought to the Roman world, or by the encounter
between Hellenism and Christianity.J

d

themselves with

other forms or structures, thus modifying, more or less profoundly, their
original meaning, or losing their meaning, or receiving a new meaning (which
sometimes is a "mistranslation")

[contresens]}

For example, the development of a Latin philosophical language required the
adaptation of Greek models, so that to each term of this technical Latin
language corresponded a quite specific Greek term; but "on the occasion of
this translation many slippages of meaning, if not misinterpretations," were
produced.5 Furthermore, when it was a question of the philosophical and
theological exegesis by Latin Christian writers of biblical texts, additional
problems were posed by the presence of Latin versions of Greek versions of
the original Hebrew. Along with the misinterpretations brought about by
these translations, Christian writers added their own lack of understanding of
Hebraic ideas. Hadot gives the wonderful example of Augustine, who read in
the Latin version of Psalm IV: 9 the expression ;,, idipsum. Although the
Hebrew text contains wording that simply means "at this very moment" or

"immediately," Augustine, prompted by Neoplatonist metaphysics, discovers
in this in idipsum a name of God, "the selfsame." He thus discovers here a
metaphysics of identity and divine immutability, interpreting the expression

as meaning "in him who is identical with himself." 6 Both a Latin translation

and a Neoplatonist metaphysics come between his reading and the text.
To take another example, in Ambrose's sermon De Isaac vel anima, we find
undeniable borrowings, indeed literal translations, from Plotinus; more specifi­
c11lly, the use of texts from Plotinus that relate to the detachment from the body
11nd to the withdrawal from the sensible as a condition of contemplation. These

texts of Plotinian mysticism are joined to texts of Origenean mysticism that derive
from Origcn 's commentary on the

Song of So11gs.

But in this encounter between

Plotinian and Origenean mysticism, Plotinian mysticism loses its specificity. One

dues not find in Ambrose any important trace of what is essential to Plotinus'
thought, namely the surpassing of the intelligible in order to attain the One in
(.'CKtruly. Such texts concerning the mysticism of the One are translated by
Ambrose in such a way that they lose this meaning and arc related to the union

of lhe soul with the Logos. So Hadot speaks of "a Plotinian ascesis put in the
KC:f\' ice of an Origenean mysticism that is a mysticism of Jesus." 7 Thus Ambrose

ident i fy the Good and Christ, since with respect to the Good he brings in
1'1aul'11 Colossians I: 20, which does indeed concern Christ. Yet, as Hadot remarks,

nm

"thi11 idcntifiuation is absolutely foreign to the whole economy of the Plotinian

ro1111·esms, the introduction of a logic into texts that had a

In his essay "La fin du paganisme" Hadot examines the struggles,
contaminations, and symbioses between paganism and Christianity at the end
of antiquity. We can relatively straightforwardly reconstruct the philosophical
struggles and divergences; for instance, the claim on the part of pagan
polemicists that at the time of his trial and death Jesus did not behave like a
sage, the pagan philosophy of history that charged Christians with lacking
historical roots and that denied them the right to claim that their tradition
was the sole possessor of the truth, the pagan argument that the Christians
imagined God as a tyrant with unforeseeable whims who carries out complete­
ly arbitrary and irrational actions, such as the creation of the world at a
specific moment of time, the election and then rejection of the Jewish people,
the incarnation, the resurrection, and, finally, the destruction of the world.1°
We can also discover in the pagan world certain attempts to assimilate
Christian elements, and even, in certain epochs, the phenomenon of symbiosis
between pagan and Christian thought. Thus, for example, the emperor
Alexander Severus used to render honor to certain portraits

(effigies) of men

who, thanks to their exceptional virtue, had entered the sphere of divinity.
Among these men were Orpheus, Appollonius of Tyana, Abraham , and
Christ, and so the emperor made a place for Christ in his pantheon.11 In the
case of some individuals one could legitimately wonder whether they were
pagans or Christians. The Hymns of S ynesius could be considered as having
been inspired by the Christian trinitarian doctrine or, on the contrary, as a
representative of a pagan theology that one could link to the tradition of

Porphyry .12

More historically subtle is the process that Hadot has labeled "contamina­
tion," that is, "the process according to which pagan ism or Christianity were
lead to adopt the ideas or the behaviors characteristic of their adversary. " 11
Such contamination, which could operate with different degrees of awareness,
extended from specific doctrines and behaviors to very general ideas and
institutions. Eusebius of Caesarea could bring together the doctrines of

Plotinus and Numenius on the First and Second God with the Christian
doctrine of the Father and the Son and their relations. 1 4 And the emperor
Julian could wish to impose the organization of the Christian church on
paganism, wanting the pagan church to imitate the Christian church's
activities. 1 5
Most important from a philosophical point of view, Christianity borrowed
the very idea of theology, its methods and principles, from paganism. As
Hadot has shown, both pagans and Christians had an analogous conception
of truth; truth was an historical reality of divine origin, a revelation given by
God to humanity at a particular time. As a consequence, their conceptions of
philosophy and theology were identical - "human thought could only be
exegetical, that is, it must try to interpret an initial datum: the revelation
contained in myths, traditions, the most ancient laws." 11' Not only wns

5

Introduction

Christianity contaminated by the pagan idea of theology, but the ancient
Christian idea of hierarchical monotheism, so central to early Christianity,
could be found within the evolution of paganism itself, especially under the
influence of the imperial ideology. The conceptions of monotheism and
hierarchy that served to define the Byzantine Christian world were thus also
contaminations from the pagan world; indeed, these ideas could be said to
sum up the entire essence of late paganism. 1 7 These contaminations inevitably
led to distortions, deformations, misunderstandings of all kinds, but the
overlap and intersections brought about by these contaminations also led to
the evolution of thought, the development of fresh ideas, the creation, by way
of creative misinterpretations, of new concepts, categories, arguments, and
conclusions.
In th e first century BC, as a consequence of the destruction of most of
the permanent philosophical institutions in Athens (which had existed
from the fourth to the first century BC), the four great philosophical
schools - Platonism, Aristotelianism, Epicureanism, and Stoicism - could
no longer be supported by the Athenian institutions created by their
founders.
In order to affirm their fidelity to the founder, the four philosophical
schools, scattered i n different cities of the Orient and Occident, can no
longer depend on the institution that he had created, nor on the oral
tradition internal to the school, but solely on the texts of the founder.
The classes of philosophy will therefore consist above all in commen­
taries on the text. '8
The exegetical phase of the history of ancient philosophy was characterized

hy the

ract that the principal scholarly exercise was the explication of a text.
Exeietical philosophy conceived of the philosopher not as a "solitary thinker
who would invent and construct his system and his truth in an autonomous
way. The philosopher thinks in a tradition." 19 For the philosopher during this
period, truth is founded on the authority of this tradition, and it is given in
fhc te x ts of the founders of the tradition.
Perhaps the most extraordinary instance of the weight and pressures of
nc:gctical thought is to be found in the example, extensively discussed by
I l1ulot, of the appearance of the distinction between "being" as an infinitive
(111 1•11mi) and "being" as a participle (to on). In a series of articles Hadot has
"lu1wn thnt this distinction arose as a result of the n eed to gi ve a coherent
L'Xcgc:11i11 of Plato's second hypothesis in the Parmenides, "If the one is, how is
II 1m1111iblc that it should not participate in being [ 011sia ]?" 20 The Neoplatonist
exegesis of the Parmtnitles required that each of Plato's hypotheses correspond

Introduction

"participation'' the Neoplatonists meant "receiving a form from a superior
and transcendent Form," the second One's participation in ousia is under­
stood to be participation in an ousia in itself which transcends the participat­
ing subject. However, according to good Neoplatonist doctrine, above the
second One there is only the first One, and this first One, absolutely simple,
cannot be an ousia. The first ousia must be the second One. So how could
Plato have spoken of an ousia that precedes the second One? An anonymous
Neoplatonist commentator on the Parmenides, whom Hadot has identified as
Porphyry, squarely confronted these difficulties: "influenced by the exegetical
tradition characteristic of his school, the words of Plato evoked for him the
entities of a rigid system, and the literal text became reconcilable only with
difficulty with what he believed to be Plato's meaning."21 Porphyry's solution
to this difficulty would consist in presenting an exegesis according ·to which
Plato had employed the word ousia in an enigmatic way, instead of another
word whose meaning is close to the word ousia, namely the word einai. I f
Plato speaks o f a n ousia i n which the second One participates, h e wants it to
be understood that the second One receives the property of being a "being"
(to on} and of being "ousia" from the first One, because the first One is itself
"being" (to einai} "not in the sense of a subject but in the sense of an activity
of being, considered as pure and without subject. "22 Thus, as Hadot shows,
we can see appear for the first time in the history of onto-theology a
remarkable distinction between being as an infinitive and being as a participle.
Being as an infinitive characterizes the first One, pure absolutely indetermin­
ate activity, while being as a participle is a property of the second One, the
first substance and first determination that participates in this pure activity .
This distinction arises from the form ulation used by Plato at the beginning
of the second hypothesis of the Parmenides, joined to the Neoplatonist
exegesis of the Parmenides and the need for Porphyry to try to explain, from
within this system of exegesis, why Plato said what he did. 21 The result,

according to Hadot, was "certainly a misinterpretation, but a creative
misinterpretation, sprung from the very difficulties of the exegetical
method . " 24 This creative misunderstanding was to have a profound influence
on the development of a negative theology of being, and, by way of Boethius'
distinction between esse and id quod est, was decisively to affect the history of
Western philosophical thought.25
As early as 1959, Hadot described a phenomenon, constant in the history
of philosophy,
that stems from the evolution of the philosophical consciousness: it is
impossible to remain faithful to a tradition without taking up again the
formulas of the creator of this tradition; but it is also impossible to use
these formulas without giving them a meaning that the previous
philosopher could not even have suspected. One then sincerely bclicvt'!I

that this new meaning corresponds to the deep intention of this
philosopher. In fact, this new meaning corresponds1 to a kind of
possibility of evolution of the original doctrine.26
Not all such bestowals of new meaning are creative misunderstandings, as
Hadot well realizes. But some of them have led to new ideas of great
philosophical significance. We must study the h istory of these exegeses,
discover how these misunderstandings have been used, what philosophical
consequences and what paths of evolution have resulted from them, in order
to determine whether they have indeed been creative. In the most interesting
of cases, we may find that a history of misinterpretation and a history of
philosophical creativity are intimately linked .27
In his inaugural lecture to the College de France, Hadot writes:
It seems to me, indeed, that in order to understand the works of the
philosophers of antiquity we must take account of all the concrete
conditions in which they wrote, all the constraints that weighed upon
them: the framework of the school, the very nature of phi/osophia,
literary genres, rhetorical rules, dogmatic imperatives, and traditional
modes of reasoning. One cannot read an ancient author the way one
does a contemporary author (which does not mean that contemporary
authors are easier to understand than those of antiquity). In fact, the
works of antiquity are produced under entirely different conditions than
those of their modern counterparts.2JI
Hadot's studies of the history of ancient philosophy and theology have always
included the analysis of "the rules, the forms, the models of discourse," the
framework of the li terary genre whose rules are often rigorously codified, in
which the thoughts of the ancient author are expressed.29 Such analysis is
necessary in order to understand both the details of the work, the exact import
of particular statements, as well as the general meaning of the work as a whole.
Literary structure and conceptual structure m ust never be separated . 30
Describing his method of study for Latin Patristics, Hadot has invoked an
exceptionally illuminating analogy, comparing what happens in these studies
lo what takes place in those curious paintings where
secs at first sight a landscape that seems to be composed normally.
One thinks that if there is, in such and such a place in the picture, a
house or a tree it depends solely on the imagination of the artist. But if
nnc looks a t 1he whole painting from a certain angle the landscape
1r111111form11 i t 11c l f into 11 hidden figure , a face or a human body, and one
11mlcr11t11nll11 then th11t the hou11 t• or the tree wa11 not there out of pure

one

8
fancy, but was necessary because it made up part of the hidden figure.
When one discovers the structure or the fundamental form of a text, one
has an analogous experience: certain details that seemed to be there only
in an arbitrary way become necessary, because they make up an integral
part of the traditional figure used. And just as one can contrast or
compare the sense of the face and the sense of the countryside, one can
compare the meaning of the traditional form or structure, considered in
themselves, and that of the text which has borrowed them . . . We often
have the impression when we read ancient authors th at they write badly,

that the sequence of ideas lacks coherence and connection. But it is
precisely because the true figure escapes us that we do not perceive the
form that renders all the details necessary . .. once discovered, the
hidden form will make necessary all of the details that one often believed
arbitrary or without importance.31
This description brilliantly captures the significance of placing the work
studied in the framework of its literary genre, the transformation in under­
standing brought about when one moves from the insignificant and arbi­
trary to the meaningful and necessary. Hadot's methodological prescriptions
can be fruitfully applied at virtually every level in the analysis of ancient
thought.
I want to consider briefly a series of examples not taken up ·by Hadot in
order to emphasize the depth and accuracy of his analogy. I have in mind the
extraordinary work on mystical cryptography undertaken by Margherita
Guarducci. By carefully delineating the historical and geographical context
and by discovering "a coherent and rational system," 32 Guarducci was able to
show that certain ancient graffiti, both pagan and Christian, contained hidden
and almost dissimulated thoughts of a philosophical and religious character.33
The situation that results is precisely one in which phenomena that were
neglected or unacknowledged now assume a profound significance. So, for
example, she has demonstrated that the letters PE, the two initial letters of
the name Petrus, sometimes take on the form of the characteristic monogram
or
that this monogram represents the keys of the first vicar of Christ,
and that the monogram sometimes even visually resembles, with the three
teeth of the E adjoined to the P, a key
Peter's monogram can also be
adjoined to a monogram for Christ
so that we find on wall g of the
Vatican this kind of graffiti,
expressing the indissoluble union of Peter
and Christ.35 By unraveling the rational and coherent system formed by this
mystical cryptography she can show that an inscription that previously found
no plausible explanation can be clearly and convincingly explained. Thus the
inscription found on a tomb (and shown in plate 1. 1) wishes life in Christ and
Peter to the deceased . The bi valence of the Greek rho and the Latin pi is used
to superpose the monogram of Christ
with the letters PE thus forming,

which is inserted within the preposition

in.36 Just as

Hadot has described it,

these are cases where "once discovered, the hidden form will make necessary all

of the details that one often believed arbitrary or without sigrtificance." 37
This mystical cryptography can also be found in the pagan world, where a
form that can seem to be intrinsically insignificant is transformed, once the
hidden figure is discovered, into the expression of a philosophical doctrine.
Thus not only did the Pythagoreans recognize in the letter Y the initial letter
of the word

vriera and

this letter

represent graphically the ancient concept of the divergent paths

to

therefore the concept of "salvation"; they also used

of virtue and vice, the doctrine that life presented a forking path and that one
must choose between the path of virtue on the right, which will lead to peace,
and the path of vice on the left, where one will fall into misery.38 A funereal
stcle, datable f�om the first century AD, of a deceased man named "Pythago­
ras" exhibits a large Y that divides the stone into five sections (shown in plate

1.2). Each section contains various scenes inspired by Pythagorean doctrine.
In the center is an image of the deceased (or perhaps of his homonym,
Pythagoras of Samo); to the right arc scenes personifying virtue, to the left
arc scenes personifying dissoluteness. Guarducci concludes that it is "easy to
recognize in the succession of these scenes that which the literary sources have
handed down to us ... : the Pythagorean Y, symbol of the divergent paths of

virtue

and of vice, one of which brings ... eternal pleasure, the other ...

definitive ruin." ·19 Ir is indeed easy to come to this recognition, once one has
uncovered and deciphered the genre of mystical cryptography.But if one fails
to perceive the rigorously codified rules, one will see nothing of importance,
one will be forced to resort to lapidary error and accident to explain away
various features, one will find no coherence in many of the inscriptions."° The

diffcrence between recognizing profound significance and trivial error or
arbitrariness will depend on whether the true form has escaped us or has
transformed our understanding.41
One might well imagine that the endeavor to hide religious and philosophical
thoughts within inscriptions and graffiti would require that we discover the
hidden form necessary to give coherence and sense to these graffiti. But one
might also assume that when we are confronted with extended philosophical
writing, andcnt texts, like many modem ones, will exhibit their structure more

or less on the surface. And then when we fail to discern this strm..ture, we
conclude, as Hadot remarks, that ancient authors "write badly, that the sequence

of ideas lacks coherence and conncction."42 That the assumption on which this
conclusion is based is false, that the structure of even extended ancient

rhilosophical texts may not lie easily open to view, is clearly shown by Harlot's
of the underlying structure or fundamental form of Marcus
Aurelius' Mt'tlitfltim1s. Indeed, Hadot's description of the experience of seeing a

The first printed edition of Marcus Aurelius'

Meditations appeared

in 1559,

accompanied by a Latin translation. The editor, "Xylander" (Wilhelm
Holzmann), faced with what he saw as the total disorder of the text,
conjectured that the

Meditations,

as presented in the manuscript he edited,

were only disconnected extracts from the work of Marcus Aurelius, that
Marcus' book had reached us in a mutilated, incomplete, disordered state.43
This conjecture was taken up again in

1624 by Caspar Barth, who,

recognizing that one could detect traces of organization and sometimes
lengthy reasoning in the

Meditations,

claimed that the text that had reached

us consisted only of extracts from a vast, systematic treatise of ethics that the
emperor had written."" Such conjectures, and their variations, have accompa­
nied the

Medi1atio11s

throughout its history, always trying to account for the

disorder and haphazardousness of this work.45 The contemporary reader may
find individual aphorisms that seem to speak for themselves, but will be left
with the basic impression that, as Hadot puts it, "these sentences seem to
follow one another without order, with the randomness of the impressions and
states of soul of the emperor-philosopher."46
Hadot has recognized that Marcus Aurelius'
of writing known as

h_ypomnemata,

Meditations

belong to the type

personal notes and reflections written day

to day. This kind of writing existed throughout antiquity, and at least two of
Marcus' seventeenth-century editors and translators also recognized his work

Introduction

11

as consisting of personal notes.47 Marcus wrote day to day without trying to
compose a work intended for the public; his Meditations arc for the most part
exhortations to himself, a dialogue with himself. 4H Moreover, his thoughts and

reflections were written down according to "a very refined literary form,

hccause it was precisely the perfection of the formulas that could assure them

their psychological efficacy, their power of persuasion." 49 Thus, although
Marcus' work belongs to the literary genre of personal notes written day to

dny (�l'Pomne111att1),

they are also quite distinct from other examples of such

notes. As Hadot concludes, "it appears indeed that unlike other /1ypomnemt1lt1,
the Metlilt1lions of Marcus Aurelius are 'spiritual exercises,' practiced accord­
inl( to a certain method." 50
Spiritual exercises arc p r acticed in the Meditations according to a method,
I ludot has written, "as rigorous, as codified, as systematic as the famous
Spirit11t1/ E.l'ercises of Saint Ignatius." 51 And the key to this method, and thus
111 the Metlitt1tio11s, is to be found in the three philosophical topoi distinguished
hy Epictetus. Epictetus distinguished three acts or functions of the soul

Hadot has shown that Epictetus identified the three disciplines with the three
parts of philosophy - the discipline of assent with logic, the discipline of
desire with physics, and the discipline of inclinations with ethics.53 And he
used the word

of virtually the entire work, and our recognition of their role allows the
surface disorder of the

Meditations to

transform itself, so that we see beneath

this apparent lack of order a rigorous underlying form or structure:
beneath this apparent disorder hides a rigorous law that explains the
content of the

Meditations.

This law is, moreover, expressed clearly in a

ternary schema that reappears often in certain maxims. But this schema
was not invented by Marcus Aurelius: in fact it corresponds exactly to

topoi that Epictetus distinguishes in his Discour­
ses. It is this ternary schema that inspires the whole composition of the
Meditations of the emperor. Each maxim develops either one of these
very characteristics topoi, or two of them, or three of them.5s
the three philosophical

These three disciplines of life are truly the key to the

Meditations

of

Marcus Aurelius. It is in fact around each of them that the different
dogmas ... are organized, are crystallized. To the discipline of judg­
ment are linked the dogmas that affirm the freedom of judgment, the
possibility that man has to criticize and modify his own thought; around
the discipline that directs our attitude with regard to external events are
gathered all the theorems on the causality of universal Nature; lastly, the
discipline of action is nourished by all the theoretical propositions
relative to the mutual attraction that unites reasonable beings.
Finally, one discovers that behind an apparent disorder, one can
uncover, in the

Meditations,

an extremely rigorous conceptual system.65

Each maxim, aphorism, sentence of the

Meditations

is an exercise of actualiz­

ation and assimilation of one or more of the three disciplines of life.57 Thus
Hadot, discovering the form "that renders all the details necessary," allows us
to read the

Meditations

coherently, transforms our experience from that of

reading a disconnected journal to one of reading a rigorously structured
philosophical work.sx
Hadot's discovery of the ternary schema underlying the

Meditations

not

only allows us to give structure to its merely apparent disorder. It also allows
us to keep from falling into misplaced psychological judgments about the
author of these spiritual exercises. Precisely because the Meditatitms arc

Introduction

13

traditional Stoic spiritual exercises, we must be very prudent about drawing
conclusions concerning the personal psychological states of

iyiarcus. As Hadot

has said, we are all too ready to project our own attitudes and intentions on
ancient works, to see the

Meditations as the spontaneous effusion of Marcus'
On the Nature of Things as the work of an

everyday feelings, to see Lucretius'

anxious man attempting to combat his anxiety, or to understand Augustine's

Confessions

as the expression of his desire to confess and so to give us an

autobiographical account of his life. 59 But in antiquity,
the rules of discourse were rigorously codified: in order to say what one
wanted to say, an author had to say it in a certain way, according to
traditional models, according to rules prescribed by rhetoric and philo­
sophy . . . [the Meditations] are an exercise realized according to .definite
rules;

they

imply . . . a

pre-existent outline

which

the

emperor­

philosopher can only amplify. Often, he only says certain things because
he

must

say them in virtue of the models and precepts that impose

themselves on him. One will therefore only be able to understand the
sense of this work when one has discovered, among other things, the
prefabricated schemata that were imposed on it.60
Hadot has charted all of the supposed psychological portraits of Marcus
drawn from the

Meditations,

which see him as suffering from gloomy

resignation, extreme skepticism, despair. Some modern authors have claimed
to find in the

Meditations

evidence of a gastric ulcer and its psychological

consequences, or of the psychological effects of Marcus' abuse of opium.61 But

all of these attempts at historical psychology ignore the mechanisms of literary
composition in antiquity, and

fail to take into account Marcus' modes of

thought, the fact that he was practicing spiritual exercises, derived from
Stoicism, more particularly from Epictetus, whose essential goal is to in­
fluence himself, to produce an effect in himself.62
Take, for example, the repeated claims that the

Meditations

show us

that Marcus was a pessimist. After all, he does write things such as the
following:
Just like your bath-water appears to you - oil, sweat, filth, dirty water,
all kinds of loathsome stuff - such is each portion of life, and every
substance.6.1
These foods and disht>s . . . arc only dead fish, birds and pigs; this
Falcrnian w ine is a bit of grape-juice; this purple-edged toga is some
s hee p ' s luiirs dipped in the blood of shellfish; as for sex, it is the rubbing

to[(cthcr of pieces of gut, followed by the spasmodic secretion of a little bit
of sl ime. 111

14

Introduction

What are these remarks, if not the expression of Marcus' characteristic
pessimism? In each of these cases of supposed pessimism, Hadot has been able
to show specifically that Marcus was not giving us his personal impressions,
that he was not expressing a negative experience that he had lived, but was
rather "exercising himself, spiritually and literarily. " 65 Marcus is, first of all,
practicing the Stoic discipline of giving physical definitions which, adhering
to the objective representation of the phenomenon, are employed "to dispel
the false conventional judgements of value that people express concerning
objects. " 66 Marcus writes:
always make a definition or description of the object that occurs in your
representation, so as to be able to see it as it is in its essence, both as a
whole and as divided into its constituent parts, and say to yourself its
proper name and the names of those things out of which it is composed,
and into which it will be dissolved.67
This kind of definition is intended to strip representations of "all subjective
and anthropomorphic considerations, from all relations to the human point of
view," thus defining objects, in a certain way, scientifically and physically .68
Such definitions belong both to the discipline of judgment, or logic, and to
the discipline of desire, or physics . The critique of representations and the
pursuit of the objective representation are, obviously enough, part of the
domain of logic; but these definitions can only be realized if one places oneself
in "the point of view of physics, by situating events and objects in the
perspective of universal Nature . " h9
Marcus is not giving us his personal perception of reality, from which we
may then deduce conclusions about his sensibility or characteristic disposi­
tions. He is rather employing various means to transform himself, to acquire
a certain inner state of freedom and peace. To do so he must overcome
"solidly rooted prejudices, irrational terrors," employing all the means
available to him.m Here is how Hadot describes the ultimate goal of these
physical definitions:
This spiritual exercise of "physical" definition has exactly the effect of
rendering us indifferent before indifferent things, that is, of making us
renounce making differences among things that do not depend on us,
but which depend on the will of universal Nature. No longer to make
differences is therefore, first of all, to renounce attributing to certain
things a false value, measured only according to human scale. This is
the meaning of the apparently pessimistic declarations. But to no longer
make differences is to discover that all things, even those which seem
disgusting to us, have an equal value if one measures them according to
the scale of universal Nature, that is, looks at things with the same vision

15

that Nature looks at them . . . . This inner attitude by which the soul
does not make differences, but remains indifferent
corresponds to magnanimity of the soul

things,

Thus with respect to the issue of Marcus' pessimism, we see the importance
of placing the Meditations in its literary and philosophical context. Abstracting
from this context leads to an improper psychology, and to an uncreative
misreading of the force of the Meditations, ignoring its basic philosophical
aims and procedures. Hadot diagnoses, with great insight, the dangers of
historical psychology:
We have here a fine example of the dangers of historical psychology
applied to ancient texts. Before presenting the interpretation of a text,
one should first begin by trying to distinguish between, on the one hand,
the traditional elements, one could say prefabricated, that the author
employs and, on the other hand, what he wants to do with them. Failing
to make this distinction, one will consider as symptomatic formulas or
attitudes which are not at all such, because they do not emanate from
the personality of the author, but are imposed on him by tradition. One
must search for what the author wishes to say, but also for what he can
or cannot say, what he must or must not say, as a function of the
traditions and the circumstances that are imposed on him.72
That the temptation to read ancient texts as expressions of their author's
psychological states and character is extremely difficult to overcome is shown by
the development of Hadot's own interpretation of Augustine's

Confessions. In a

widely cited paper, originally delivered in 1960, Hadot concludes his discussion
of the development of the notion of the person with the claim that in Augustine's

Co11fossions, "the modem self rises into view in history." 73 Citing various passages
from Augustine on the mystery of the self, and following Groethuysen's
interpretation, Hadot

is led to conclude, on the basis of these passages, that "With

Augustine the 'I' makes its entry into philosophical reasoning in a way that
implies a radical change of inner perspective. " 7� Hadot came little by little to

be misled by Augustine's use of "I," that "the
Confessions is not as important as one might
believe." 75 The "I" of Augustine's Confessions continues the "I" of Job, David,
or Paul, that is, Augustine "identifies himself with the self who speaks in the
realize, however, that one must not

autobiographical part of the

Scriptures. Ultimately the human

sell who speaks in the Bible is

Adam, a sinner

without doubt, but converted by God and renewed in Christ. " 76 Thus, following
Pierre Courcelle, Hadot recognizes that the

Confessions is essentially a theological

work, in which each scene may assume a symbolic meaning. So "in this literary
genre . . . il is extremely d i fficult to distingu ish between a symbolic enactment

16

Introduction
Hadot therefore insists on the theological significance, in the first part of

Book I I of the Confessions, of the images used by Augustine in order to
describe his inner state.78 And in the second part of Book II, when Augustine
recounts at length his adolescent theft of pears, we are in fact confronted with
a theological account concerning original sin. The "psychology of Augustine
the sinner is reconstructed from the ideal psychology of Adam, disobedient
to God in order to imitate, in a perverse way, the divine freedom . " 7'l Rather
than using this scene to draw a psychological portrait of Augustine the
individual, Hadot understands it as part of an anti-Manichean theological
polemic. Here is his interpretation, which is a model of how to avoid the
excesses of historical psychology when reading ancient texts:
the psychological and theological problem of original sin is posed on the
occasion of Augustine's theft, and we find ourselves once again in an
anti-Manichean problematic: in stealing the pears, as Adam stealing the
forbidden fruit, Augustine did not desire the fruit itself, that is, an
existing reality; rather he desired evil itsel f, that is, something that
doesn't have any substance. How is this possible? After having posed
the problem at length (4, 9-6, 1 3 ), Augustine responds by showing that
he had loved something "positive" in the evil: to imitate the freedom of
God , but in a perverse way . Every sin appt."ll rs thus as an upside-down
imitation of the divine reality.1111
Instead of engaging in a psychological in terpretation of Augustine's adol­
escence, Hadot's read ing allows us to sec that we arc in the presence of a
theological d iscussion of the nature of sin, and that Augustine's lengthy
recounting of his theft is not autobiographically motivated, but is necessary
in order for us to see the way in which sin is a perverse imitation of divine
reality.
Moreover, by placing the Confessions with in the Christian exegetical

tradition, Hadot is able to show that the last three books of the Confessions, in
which Augustine seems to abandon autobiography to devote himself to
exegesis, far from bein g foreign to the rest of the work, do not ultimately have
"a different object from the account that is narrated in the biographical
part. " 81 Hadot demonstrates that Augustine very often brings together the
two states of his soul - obscurity, then light - wi th the two states of the earth
at the beginning of the account of Genesis. In its first state the earth was
invisibilis and incomposita, and in its second state it received the illumination
of the Fiat lux.82 In Book II, Augustine presents his adolescence as a state of
obscurity and bubbling fluidity, and Hadot has shown that in this description
one can recognize "the vocabulary employed in Book XIII of the Crmfessions
to describe the chaos of Gen 1 , 2 . " 83 Furthermore, in Book XIII the images
of darkness and fluctuation serve precisely to describe "the state of the soul

17

Introduction

still 'formless,' before its conversion t o God . " M Thus Hadot can claim that
"the idea of the passage of the creature from a formless s sate to a state of
formation and of conversion dominates the whole work. " 85 l n Book XIII the
biblical account of creation becomes the description of the phases and stages
of the salvation of humanity.86 Putting together Augustine's autobiographical
and exegetical descriptions, Hadot can demonstrate the inner unity of the
work, the fact that for A ugustine "Genesis is . . . the account produced by the
Holy Spirit of the conversion of the soul, as the Confessions is the account that
he h imself produces of his own conversion. " 117 Hadot therefore warns us that
we m ust interpret this text in light of the literary genre to which it belongs,
the tradition of exegesis of Ambrose and Origen, and that we will commit a
misunderstanding if we believe we have discovered the self "already" in the
Crmfessions.Hll We find in Hadot's own interpretation of Augustine the initial
outline of a kind of historical psychology, one that discovers in the

Confessions

the beginnings of the modern self. However, this is followed by a more
detailed attention to the mechanisms of literary composition and to the
theological genre of the Confessions, an attention that both prevents the
apparent autobiography from becoming the philosophical center of the work
and permits us to see the unity between the first ten books and the last three.
There is, of course, a sel f to be found in the Confessions, but "it must not be
understood as the incommunicable singularity of the man Augustine, but, on
the contrary, as universal humanity of which the events of the life of
Augustine are only the symbols. " 89
Hadot's insistence on not separating conceptual structure from literary
structure also played a sign i ficant role in his interpretation of Wittgenstein's
work. As far as I have been able to determine, Hadot presented the first
detailed discussions in French of Wittgenstein's books, reviewing everything
from the Tractalus Logico-Philosophicus to the Philosophical Investigations and
Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics.'m In his 1 959 discussion of
the later Wittgenstei n, Hadot argues, qu ite remarkably, that the goal of
Philosophical Investigations requires a certain literary genre, t hat one cannot
dissociate the form of the
philosophy.

Investigations from Wittgenstein's conception of

cure, like a medical treatment. The work therefore does not have a
systematic structure, strictly speaking [ pas de plan, a proprement parler].91

At the time Hadot was writing about Wittgenstein, and even today, so many
philosophers ignored the way Philosophical Jnvesligalions is written that it is
astonishing, at first sight, to see an historian of ancient philosophy clearly
understanding the import of this aspect of Wittgenstein's work. But Hadot
has long emphasized that ancient philosophy presented itself as a therapeutics
and that this goal profoundly affected the philosophical writing of antiquity.92
As early as

1 960 Hadot wrote that in ancient philosophy "more than theses,

one teaches ways, methods, spiritual exercises," that "dogmas" have only a
secondary aspect.93 No doubt it was precisely Hadot's understanding of the
history of ancient philosophy that made it possible for him to see central, but
still neglected, characteristics of Wittgenstein's work.
In "Jeux de langage et philosophic," Hadot was to employ Wittgenstein's
notion of a language game in an historical perspective that, as he recognized ,
went well beyond anything with which Wittgenstein was preoccupied. Hadot
argued that we must "break with the idea that philosophical language
functions in a uniform way" and that ''it is impossible to give a meaning to
the positions of philosophers without situating them in their language
game . " 'H Aware of the different philosophical language games of antiquity,
Hadot could well insist that an ancient formula be placed in the concrete
context of its determinate language game, that its meaning could change as a
function of a change in language game.95 Thus Hadot could draw the general
historiographical conclusion that we must "consider as very different language
games those literary genres, so profoundly diverse, represented by the
dialogue, the exhortation or protreptic, the hymn or prayer . . . the manual,
the dogmatic treatise, the meditation . " 96 And we must also distinguish
between the attitudes represented by dialectic, rhetorical argumentation,
logical reasoning, and didactic exposition, since we will often be able to
establish that "the very fact of sitt1ating oneself in one of these traditions
predetermines the very content of the doctrine that is expressed in this
language game ." 97 By overcoming the temptation to see philosophical lan­
guage as always functioning in the same way, Hadot could take account of the
conceptual

and

literary specificity of different philosophical attitudes.

Whether reading Plotinus, Marcus Aurelius, or Augustine, Hadot has made
detailed use of his methodological prescriptions, not allowing the surface
pronouncements of the texts to obscure the underlying structure, the literary
genre and modes of thought that confer a determinate meaning on these
pronouncements. Employing all of their resources, Hadot has used these
practices of interpretation to try to reconstruct the fundamental mean i n g

(sens

de base), the meaning "intended" by the author (le sens "t,tm/11 " p11r l 't111 / e11r),
of these ancient tcxts.'18 More often than not , as is c \• i d c n t from the cxnm plci;

19

Introduction

I have gi ven, this meaning will not be apparent. And if Hadot's practices of
interpretation are most often employed with respect to ancient p ilosophical and

�

theological writing, his discussion of Wittgenstein makes clear the need,
throughout the history of philosophy, for such practices. To restrict the
importance of Hadot's lessons to one period in the history of thought would be
radically to misunderstand the techniques and procedures of human thought.

Spiritual Exercises

Hadot has written that he was led to become aware of the importance of what

he has called "spiritual ex erc ise s" by his work of interpretation of ancient

philosophical tex ts .99 On the one hand, like his predecessors and contempor­
aries, Hadot encountered the well-known phenomenon of the incoherences,

even contradictions, in the works of ancient philosophical authors . On the

other hand, many modern historians of ancient philosophy have begu n from

the assumption that ancient philosophers were attempting, in the same way
as mod ern philosophe rs , to construct systems, that ancient philosoph y was

esse n tial l y a ph ilosoph ica l discourse consisting of a "certain type of organiza­

tion of language, comprised of propositions having as their object the
universe, human societ y, and l a n gua ge i tsel f. " 1 00 Thus the essential task of the
historian of p h iloso p h y w a s thou gh t to consist in "the analysis of the ge nesis
and the structures of the l itera ry works that were written by the phi loso phers,

especially in the study of the rational connection and the internal coherence
of these systematic expositions." 1 0 1 U nder these interpretive constraints,
modern his toria ns of ancient ph ilosophy could not but deplore the awkward
expositions, defects of co m positio n , and ou trigh t incoherences in the ancient
authors they studied. 1 112

Hadot, ho we v er, rather than deploring these ancient authors' failures to

measure up to the modern standard of the systematic philosophical treatise,
realized that in order to u nders tand and e x plain these apparent defects, one

must not only analyze the structure of these ancient philosophical texts, but

one must also situate them

in t he "living praxis from which they emanated ." 1 03

An essential a s pec t o f this li vin g pra x is was the oral dimension of ancient

philosophy, and the written philosophical works of Greco-Roman antiquity

were "never completely free of the constraints imposed by oral trans­

mission." uu Hadot has described this written work as only a material support
for

a

spoken word intended to become spoken word again, "like a modern

record or cassette which are only an intermedia r y between two events: the

record i n g and the reheari ng . " 105 All of ancient philosophy believed in what
1-ladot once called , thinking of Plato's Phaedrus, the "ontological value of the

spoken word " ; 1 h is l i v i n g and a n i mated dis cour se w as not pr incipal ly intended

Introduction

or listener." 1 06 Thus the "propositional element" was not the most important
element of ancient philosophical teaching, and Hadot has frequently cited
Victor Goldschmitt's formula, originally applied to the Platonic dialogues but
used by Hadot to characterize ancient philosophy more generally, that ancient
philosophical discourse intended "to form more than to inform . " 1 07
Hadot claims that it is probably a mistake about the nature of ancient
philosophy to consider abstraction, made possible by writing, its most
important characteristic:
For ancient philosophy, at least beginning from the sophists and
Socrates, intended, in the first instance, to form people and to transform
souls. That is why, in Antiquity, philosophical teaching is given above
all in oral form, because only the living word, in dialogues, in
conversations pursued for a long time, can accomplish such an action.
The written work, considerable as it is, is therefore most of the time
only an echo or a complement of this oral teaching. 108
This is one reason why, for Hadot, to philosophize is to learn how to
dialogue.109 A Socratic dialogue is a spiritual exercise practiced in common,
and it incites one to give attention to onesel f, to take care of oneself, to know
onesel f. The Socratic maxim "know thyself" requires a relation of the self to
itself that "constitutes the basis of all spiritual exercises. " i m Every spiritual
exercise is dialogical insofar as it is an "exercise of authentic presence" of the
self to itself, and of the self to others. 1 1 1 The Socratic and Platonic dialogues
exhibit this authentic presence in the way that they show that what is most
important is not the solution to a particu lar problem , but the path traversed
together in arriving at this solution . Hence, we can understand the critical
significance of the dimension of the interlocutor, with all of its starts and
stops, hesitations, detours, and digressions. This essential dimension
prevents the dialogue from being a theoretical and dogmatic account and
forces it to be a concrete and practical exercise, because, to be precise,
it is not concerned with the exposition of a doctrine, but with guiding
an interlocutor to a certain settled mental attitude: it is a combat,
amicable but real . We should note that this is what takes place in every

spiritual exercise; it is necessary to make oneself change one's point of
view, attitude, set of convictions, therefore to dialogue with oneself,
therefore to struggle with oneself. 1 I Z
A lthough Hadot recognizes that some ancient philosophical works are s o to
speak "more written" than others, he insists that even these works "are closely
linked to the activity of teaching" and must "be understood from the
perspective of dialectical and exegetical scholarly exercises . " 1 1 ·1 The tnsk of I he

Introduction

philosopher was not primarily one of communicating "an encyclopedic
knowledge in the form of a system of propositions and of concepts that would
reflect, more or less well, the system of the worl d . " 1 14 T herefore, even
definitions were nothing by themselves, independently of the road traveled to
reach them. The philosophers of antiquity were concerned not with ready­
made knowledge, but with imparting that training and education that would
allow their disciples to "orient themselves in thought, in the life of the city,
or in the world. "

1 15

If this is most obviously true of the Platonic dialogues,

Hadot has reminded us that it is also true of the methods of Aristotle and the
treatises of Plotinus: "the written philosophical work, precisely because it is a
direct or indirect echo of oral teaching, now appears to us as a

set of exercises,

intended to make one practice a method, rather than as a doctrinal exposi­
tion. " 1 16
Moreover, these exercises were not conceived of as purely intellectual , as
merely theoretical and formal exercises of discourse totally separated from life.
Throughout the history of ancient philosophy, we can find criticisms of those
philosophers who went no further than to develop a beautiful style of
discourse or dialectical subtlety, who wished to stand out by making an
ostentatious display of their philosophical discourse, but did not exercise
themselves in the things of life. 1 17 Rather than aiming at the acquisition of a
purely abstract knowledge, these exercises aimed at realizing a transformation
of one's vision of the world and a metamorphosis of one's personality. The
philosopher needed to be trained not only to know how to speak and debate,
but also to know how to live. The exercise of philosophy "was therefore not
only intellectual, but could also be spiritual. "

1 18

Hence, the teaching and

training of philosophy were intended not simply to develop the intelligence
of the d isciple, but to transform all aspects of his being - intellect,
imagination, sensibility, and will. Its goal was nothing less than an art of
living, and so spiritual exercises were exercises in learning to live the

philosophical li fe . 1 1 9 Spiritual exercises were

e.wrcises

because they were

practical, required effort and training, and were lived; they were spirit u al
because they involved the entire spirit, one's whole way of being. 1 20 The art
of living demanded by philosophy was a lived exercise exhibited in every
aspect of one's existence.
Since the u ltimate goal of the theoretical discourse of philosophy was to
produce an effect in the soul of the listener or reader, this discourse had to
bear in mind not only pedagogical constraints, but "the needs of psychagogy,
of the direction of souls . " 1 2 1 Rhetorical resources were abundantly made use
of by the philosopher, and in attempting to infl uence himself and others all
means were good . 1 22 In order "to rectify distorted opinions, tenacious
prejudices, irra tional terrors," the philosopher might have "to twist them in

the other d i rection , to exaggerate in order to compensate . " 123 In ancient texts,
we dii;cover thiu "one slides rapidly from theoretical exposition to

exhortation," as often happens in Plotinus' treatises; 1 H we even find at the end
of the

Nicomachean Ethics an accentuated protreptic and exhortative character,

as Aristotle is recommending to others a certain kind of life, a spetific
conception of the good life. 125 The "presentation, literary form and content"
of philosophical discourse were modified by "the intention to influence the
disciples." 1 26 It is from this perspective that Hadot believes we m ust
understand "the effort of systematization of the Stoics and Epicureans. " 127 He
has argued that the systematic discourse of these schools did not have for its
chief goal
to procure a total and exhaustive explanation of all reality, but to link,
in an unshakable way, a small group of principles, vigorously articulated
together, which, on the one hand , on the basis of this systematization,
possess a greater persuasive force, a better psychological efficacy and
which, on the other hand, enable the philosopher to orient himself in
the world. 1 28
This systematization thus allows the philosopher to bring together and focus
the fundamental rules of life so that he can "keep them ready to hand at each
instant of his life." 129 As Hadot says, "their systematic presentation prod uces
assurance [la certitude] in the soul, therefore peace and serenity. " 1 30
In studying the literary genre of the ancient consolation, llsetraut Hadot
has clearly demonstrated the intimate connection between the practice of
spiritual exercises, the use of rhetoric and psychagogy, and literary form and
content. Since, beginning with Plato, ancient philosophy represented itself as
an exercise and training for death, the consolation is an ideal genre in which
to observe the ancient practice of philosophy . 1 .11 Noting that in all the written
consolations of antiquity, we encounter nearly always the same arguments, she
remarks that new and original arguments were not what the ancients sought
after; in the best instances, the consolations had as their goal "to recall
well-known things, to reactivate them in the soul." 1 .12 These consolations were
one important place where ancient philosophers tried to provide their
followers with the spiritual means to maintain their psychic equilibrium, a
goal that was especially acute and difficult in situations that were precarious
and pain ful.
In order to obtain this result, they had, on the one hand , to develop and
teach their philosophical doctrines, but, on the other hand, they were
perfectly conscious of the fact that the simple knowledge of a doctrine,
beneficial as it was, did not guarantee its being put into practice. To have
learned theoretically that death is not an evil does not suffice to no longer
fear it. In order for this truth to be able to penetrate to the depths of
one's being, so that it is not believed only

becomes an unshakable conviction, so that it is always "ready," "at
hand," "present to mind," so that it is a "habitus of the , soul" as the
Ancients said, one must exercise oneself constantly and w ithout respite
- "night and day," as Cicero said. To this is joined a simple mode of
life, in order not to be accustomed to what is superfluous the day it will
be necessary to separate oneself from it.
These exercises are certainly exercises of meditation, but they do not
only concern reason; in order to be efficacious, they must link the
imagination and affectivity to the work of reason, and therefore all the
psychagogical means of rhetoric .

. . 1.13

Hence we also find recommended, especially by the Stoics, the practice of
premeditation on future evils that may occur, and the need to keep present
and available in one's memory "all the edifying examples that history, epic
poetry and tragedy" entrust to us. • .M
The central place accorded t o spiritual exercises in ancient philosophy
determines how we should situate and understand the writings of ancient
philosophers, their philosophical discourse. The significance and aims of this
discourse were conditioned by the ultimate goal of transforming the lives of
individuals, of providing them with a philosophical art of living that required
nothing less than spiritual metamorphosis. We must not forget that in the
philosophy of this period, "theory is never considered an end in itself, it is
clearly and decidedly put in the service of practice," a practice so radical and
all-encompassing as to make the philosopher atopos, unclassifiable, since he is
in love with wisdom, which makes him strange, and foreign to the world of
most mortals. us Hadot pointedly captures the relation between philosophical
writing, the oral tradition, and an art of living when he writes that ancient
philosophy "always endeavored to be more a living voice than writing and still
more a life than a voice. ''

l lh

The animated words of the philosopher are at the
service of the philosopher's way of life, and his writing is an echo of these
words. We might think here of Socrates, of his constant dialogue with himself
and others. This dialogue is never closed in on itself, separate and isolated ,
but is part of, and in service to, Socrates' way of living and way of dying.
According to Xenophon, when Hippias demanded the definition of justice
from Socrates, he finally responded with these words: "Instead of speaking
of it, I make i t understood by my acts." 1 37 I f spiritual exercises were the

core of ancient philosophy, that is because philosophy was essentially a way
of life.
In order to understand the centrality of spiritual exercises to ancient
philosophy, it is crucial not to limit or reduce them to ethical exercises. As I
hove said, spiritual exercises involved all aspects of one's existence; they did
not nl lcmpt on l y l o immrc behavior in 11ccord11ncc with a code of good

24

conduct; they had, as Hadot says, not only a moral value, but an existential

value. l l8 More specifically, if we recall the traditional distinction between the
three parts of philosophy - dialectic or logic, physics, and ethics - we must
not place the practice of spiritual exercises simply in the ethical part of
philosophy. 139 We must not represent logic and physics as being those parts
of philosophy where theoretical discourse is located, presenting ethics as the
practical part where spiritual exercises are enacted . As Hadot has argued at
length, the distinction between theory and practice is located within each of
the parts of philosophy; there is a theoretical discourse concerning logic,
physics and ethics, but there is also a practical or lived logic, a lived physics,

and a lived ethics. H o

Ethics itself contains a theoretical discourse that sets forth principles,
definitions, distinctions, and analyses of the virtues and vices. But, more
importantly for the philosopher, there is also a lived ethics that puts into
practice the fundamental rules of life. 14 1 Similarly, there is a theory of logic,
wh ich includes a conception of the proposition, and explains different forms
of syllogisms, and different ways of refuting sophisms; in addition, the theory
of logic was comprised of scholarly exercises in which one learned to apply
the abstract rules. These rules of logic were also employed in the theoretical
discourses of physics and ethics, the two other parts of philosophy. Yet, again ,
there was also an everyday practice of logic that had t o b e carried o u t i n the
domain of judgment and assent. This lived logic consisted in "not giving one's

consent to what is false or doubtful." 1 4 2 Finally, the discipline of physics
included not only a theory, but a lived physics, a true spiritual exercise, wh ich
involved a way of seeing the world, a cosmic consciousness, and procured
pleasure and joy for the soul . Ml The spiritual exercises of ethics, logic, and
physics meant that the practice of philosophy did not ultimately consist in

"producing the theory of logic, that is the theory of speaking well and
thinking well, nor in producing the theory of physics, that is of the cosmos,
nor in producing the theory of acting well, but it concerned actually speaking

well, thinking well, acting well, being truly conscious of one's place in the
cosmos. " 141
The significance of locating spiritual exercises within

each

of the parts of

philosophy can be seen clearly in Hadot's criticisms of Michel Foucault. One
way of describing Hadot's misgivings about Foucault's interpretation of
ancient spiritual exercises is to say that Foucault not only gave a too narrow
construal of ancient ethics, but that he limited the "care of the self" to ethics
alone. 145 Foucault made no place for that cosmic consciousness, for physics as
a spiritual exercise, that was so important to the way in which the ancient
philosopher viewed his relation to the world. By not attending to that aspect
of the care of the self that places the self within a cosmic dimension , whereby
the self, in becoming aware of its belonging to the cosmic Whole, t h us
transforms itself, Fouca ult was not able to sec the full scope of spiri r un l

25

Introduction

exercises, that physics (and logic), as m uch as ethics, aimed at self­
transformation. Indeed, in a very different context, Paul Vey,ne has reported

the following exchange with Foucault: "One day when I aske d Foucault: 'The
care of the self, that is very nice, but what do you do with logic, what do you
do with physics?', he responded : 'Oh, these are enormous excrescences! ' " 146
Nothing could be further from Hadot's own attitude, since for him logic and
physics, as lived spiritual exercises, are as central to the nature of philosophy
as is ethics. Far from being excrescences, disfiguring and superfluous, the

practices of logic and physics were a necessary part of the ancient philo­
sopher's way of life, were crucial to his experience of himself as a philosopher,
a lover of w isdom .
In recent writings, Hadot has focused on the Stoic doctrine that logic,
physics, and ethics are not parts of philosophy itself, but are parts of
philosophical discourse

(logos kata philosophian), of the discourse relating

to philosophy. 1 47 The Stoics held that "these parts could only appear distinct
and separate in the discourse of teaching and of exposition of the philosophi­
cal dogmas," and that phi losophy, strictly speaking, was not divided into

parts. 1 48 Although expository, didactic, and pedagogical requirements made it
necessary "to cut up" philosophy into parts, philosophy proper, as an exercise
of wisdom, was considered a "single act, renewed at every instant, that one
can describe, without breaking its unity, as being the exercise of logic as well
as of physics or of ethics, according to the directions in which it is
exercised." 149 That is to say, in the lived singular act of philosophy, logic,
physics, and ethics are but "aspects of the very same virtue and very same
\l;sdom"; they are not really d istinguished with respect to one another, but
only by "the different relations that relate them to different objects, the world,
people, thought itself. " 1 50 As Hadot summarizes this view, "logic, physics and
ethics distingu ish themsel vt..'S from one another when one
ophy, but not when one lives it . " 1 5 1

speaks of philos­

For the S toics the dynamic unity of reality, the coherence of reason with
itself, meant that
It is the same Logos that produces the world , enlightens the human
being in his faculty of reasoning and expresses itself in human d iscourse,
while remaining completely identical with itself at all stages of reality.
Therefore, physics has for its object the Logos of universal nature,
ethics the Logos of reasonable human nature, logic this same Logos
expressing itself in human d iscourse. From start to finish, it is therefore
the same force and the same reality that is at the same time creative
Nature, Norm of conduct and Rule of discourse. 1 52

This func.lnmental intuit ion of the Stoics, according to which the Logos is the
common object of logic, llhysics, and eth ics, is con tin ued by those early

·

26

Introduction

Christian thinkers who present God as the common object of the three parts
of philosophy . m So, according to Augustine, the object of physics is God as
cause of being, the object of logic is God as norm of thought and the object
of ethics is God as rule of life. Moreover, this order - physics, logic, ethics corresponds to the order of the divine persons in the Trinity: the Father is
the Principle of being, the Son is Intellect and the Holy Spirit is Love. Thus,
as Hadot writes, "the systematic u ni ty of the parts of philosophy reflects here
the reciprocal intcriority of the divine Persons. " 1 54
When the Stoic philosopher, such as Epictetus or Marcus Aurelius,
acts according to the Logos, he puts into practice spiritual exercises, that
is, he disciplines his j udgments, his desire, his inclinations, he enacts a lived
logic, a lived physics, a lived ethics. These three acts of the soul exhibit
the coherence and harmony of reason with itself, and from this perspective
"the three parts of philosophy are no longer anything but three aspects of the
fundamental spiritual attitude of the Stoic. " 1 55 Although emphasizing that
the parts of philosophy arc required by and located within philosophical
discourse and that philosophy

itself is the site of spiritual

exercises,

Hadot also insists on the central role that discourse plays in the philosophical

life. The philosopher can "only act

on

himsel f and others through

d iscourse," and philosophy is thus "a mode of life that includes as an
integral part a certain mode of discourse." 1 56 The theoreti<.-al discourse of the
school to which he belongs is inwardly repeated and assimilated by the
philosopher so that he can master his own inner discourse, so that his
discourse will be ordered according to the fundamental choices and principles
that were the starting point and basis for the theoretical discourse of his
school . 1 57
Recently, Hadot has distinguished between two senses of the word "dis­
course" in ancient philosophy.
On the one hand, discourse insofar as it is addressed to a disciple or to
oneself, that is to say, the discourse li nked to an existential context, to
a concrete praxis, discourse that is actually spiritual exercise; on the
other hand, discourse considered abstractly in its formal structure, in its
intelligible content. It is the latter that the Stoics would consider
different from philosophy, but which is precisely what is usually made
the object of most of the modern studies of the h istory of philosophy.
But in the eyes of the ancient philosophers, if one contents oneself with
this discourse, one docs not do philosophy. 1 58
Although discourse, both inner and outer, is essential to the philosopher, and
although it can even take on the dimensions of a spiritual exercise, it is not
the unique component of the philosophical life, and th is life must not be
reduced to discourse .

27

Introduction
The essential element [of philosophical life] is in fact, one could say,
non-discursive, insofar as it represents a choice of life, a wi ' h to live in
such and such a way, with all the concrete consequences that that
implies in everyday life . 1 59
In Antiquity the philosopher regards himself as a philosopher, not
because he develops a philosophical discourse, but because he lives
ph i losophically . 1 60

We fi n d this essential

clement, th i s orientation and point o f view, in the

remark of Epicurus' that "Our only occupation should be the cure of
o u rse l ves, " or in the sentence attributed to him, "Empty is the discourse of
th a t philosophe r by which no human passion is attended to. " 1 61 Or we find
E p ictetus sa yi n g,

A ca rp e n ter does not com e up to you and say "Listen to me discourse
about the art of carpentry," but he makes a contract for a house and
builds it . . . Do the same thing yourself. Eat like a man, drink like a
man . . . get married, have children, take part in civic life, learn how to

put up with insults, and tolerate other people . . . 1 62

Epictetus elsewhere rebukes the person who, in the discipline of j udgment, is
pre se n ted with representation s some of which are adeq uate and others not,
yet who refuses to differentiate between them, but "would prefer to read
th eo retical treatises on the underst an ding . " 163 A n d in commenting on E p icte­
tus'

Manut1l, Simplicius writes,

One must produce the actions that arc taught by discourses. The goal
of discourse is actually actions. It is for the sake of them that the
discourses were uttered (or written) . . . In fact, Chrys i p pus did n ot
write on this subject [the nature of m an ] with the goal of being
interpre ted and understood, but so that one makes use of his writi n gs

in life. If therefore I make use of his writings in life, at that very moment
I p a rti c i p ate in the good they contain. But if I admire the:: exegete
because he p rovides goo d explanations, and if I can unde rsta n d and
mysel f i n ter p ret the text and if, quite fra n kly, e verything falls to my lot

e x ce p t the fact of m aking use of these writings i n life, would I ha ve
become anything other than a grammarian instead of a p hil osoph e r ? . . .
the fact of j ust sim p ly reading the writin gs of

Chrysippus or of

explaining them on the request of somebody else, and of not making use

of them in life, is rep rehe n sible. In fact, he should rightly be ashamed
who, being i ll , would find some writings containing cures for his illness,
would rc:1ul 1 hcm with insiicht a n d , di s ti n gu i s hin g clearly (the different

28

Introduction
parts), would explain them if need be to others, but would not make use
of these cures for his illness.164

Philosophy is an art of living that cures us of our illnesses by teaching us a
radically new way of life.
Hadot recognizes that it is only in Hellenistic philosophy that one finds a
distinction between philosophy and philosophical discourse explicitly for­
mulated. But he has also argued that "this distinction was clearly implicit in
the previous period in Plato and Aristotle." 165 Indeed, recalling the importance
of the mysteries of Eleusis in the history of ancient thought, Hadot
reminds us of the famous sentence attributed to Aristotle that the initiates of
Eleusis do not learn anything, but they experience a certain impression or
emotion.166 The initiate did not learn his other-worldly fate at Eleusis, but
lived this supra-individual life of the other world. 167 The "true secret
of Eleusis is therefore this very e:rperience, this moment when one plunges
into the completely other, this discovery of an unknown dimension of
existence." 1 68
Hadot also finds an implicit distinction between philosophy and philosoph­
ical discourse in Plato's definition of philosophy (Phaedo, 67 <..--d ) as a
tr.iining for death . The purification of the soul, its separation as far as possible
from the body and its gathering itself together within itself, is the true
practice of philosophy. Hence philosophy consists of a lived concrete exercise
and not of a theory or a conceptual edifice: "The theoretical philosophical
discourse is completely different from the lived exercises by which the soul
purifies itself of its passions and spiritually separates itself from the body. " 169
Plotinus continues this tradition when in Ennead, IV, 7, 1 0, he argues that the
soul cannot become aware of its own immateriality if it docs not perform a
moral purification that liberates it from its passions, that strips away
everything that is not truly itsclf. '711 It is this purification that allows us to gain
knowledge of the immateriality of our soul. More generally, in Ennead, VI, 7,
36, Plotinus distinguishes carefully between the methods of rational
theology that teach us about the Good, and the spiritual exercises that lead
us to the Good. The four methods of rational theology, the method of
analogy, the negative method, the affirmative method drawn from the
knowledge of the things that come from the Good, and the method of stages
or degrees (anabasmoi; Symposium, 2 1 l c) all give us knowledge about the Good.
However, only the spiritual exercises of purification, of the practice of the
virtues, of putting ourselves in order, allow us to touch the Good, to experience
it. 1 7 1 Plotinus' philosophy does not wish only
to be a discourse about objects, be they even the highest, but it wishes
actually to lead the soul to a living, concrete union with the I n tel lect and
the Good . . . Reason , by theolop;ical methods, can raise i tsel f t u t he

Introduction

29

notion of the Good but only life according to Intellect can lead to the
rea lity of the Good.112
Furthermore, as Hadot writes, "it is mystical experience that founds negative
theology, and not the reverse." 173 This mystical experience, like the mysteries
of Eleusis, does not consist in learning something, but in "living another life"
where the self "becomes the absolutely Other." 174
It is perhaps Aristotle whom we are most tempted to think of as a pure
theoretician. Although it is true that Aristotle's philosophy is a philosophy of
theoria, "this Aristotelian theoria is nevertheless not purely theoretical in the
modern sense of the word. " 175 For Aristotle, to dedicate oneself to philosophy
is to chose a bios, a way of life, that is the best realization of those capacities
that are essential to being human. The bios theoretikos, the life of contempla­
tion, is a way of life that is also the realization of our supreme happiness, an
activity that contains the purest pleasures. 176 Even scientific research on the
entities of nature is not proposed by Aristotle as an end in itself, but as "a
particular way of carrying out 'the philosophical life', one of the possible
practical realizations of the aristotelian prescription for happiness, the life
devoted to the activity of the intellect." 177 Moreover, the life of the intellect
is a participation in the divine way of life, it is the actualization of the divine
in the human, and it requires inner transformation and personal askesis. 1 18 And
it is a way of life that is, in one sense of the term, practical, since Aristotle
says that those thoughts arc practical not only that calculate the results of
action, but which are "contemplation and reasoning, that have their end in
themselves and take themselves as object." 179 This life of theoria is thus not
opposed to the practical, since it is a life of philosophy lived and practiced ; it
is precisely the "exercise of a life. " 1 80
Hadot has distinguished two senses of the tenn "theoretical,'' for which he
has employed the tcnns theorique and theoretique. The first meaning of "theore­
tical" is opposed to "practical," since it designates theoretical discourse as
opposed to lived philosophy. But the adjective theorhique which characterizes
the life of contemplation, the life according to the intellect, is not opposed by
Aristotle to philosophy as practiced and lived . In Aristotle this "theoretical life
[vie theoretique] is not a pure abstraction, but a life of the intellect, which, no
doubt, can use a theoretical discourse [discours theorique], but nonetheless
remains a life and a praxis, and which can even make room for a nondiscursivc
activity of thought, when it is a questi o n of perceiving indivisible obj<..'Cts and
God himself by noetic intuition." 1 81 Thus to think of Aristotle as a pure
theoretician is to focus exclusively on his theoretical discourse without hearing
in mind that it is a way of life, however intellectualized, that he is recommend­
ing, and which is the u l t im a te basis of his philosophy.

Introduction

philosophers who were neither scholars, professors, nor authors, but who
were honored as philosophers because of their way of life. As Hadot says, the
extension of the concept of philosopher was quite different from that of our
modern concept. In antiquity, the philosopher was not necessarily "a profes­
sor or a writer. He was first of all a person having a certain style of life, which
he willingly chose, even if he had neither taught nor written. " 1 82 Thus we
find philosophical figures not only such as Diogenes the Cynic and Pyrrho,
but also women who did not write, and celebrated statesmen who were
considered true philosophers by their contemporaries. 18l It was not only
Chrysippus or Epicurus who were considered philosophers, because they had
developed a philosophical discourse, but also every person who lived accord­
ing to the precepts of Chrysippus or Epicurus. 131
True philosophers lived in society with their fellow citizens, and yet they
lived in a different way from other people. They distinguished themselves from
others by "their moral conduct, by speaking their mind [leur franc par/er], by
their way of nourishing themselves or dressing themselves, by their attitude
with respect to wealth and to conventional values." 185 Although they did not
live a cloistered life, as in Christian monasticism, philosophy was nevertheless
analogous to the monastic movement in requiring that one convert oneself so
as to fervently adhere to a philosophical school: the philosopher had to "make
a choice that obliged him to transform his whole way of living in the world." "'"
Hence the felt rupture of the philosophical life with the conduct and
perceptions of everyday life.187 The significance of philosophy as a way of life
can also be seen in the importance given to biographies in ancient philosophical
work. As Giuseppe Cambiano has emphasized, a philosophical biography was
not predominantly a narrative intended to allow one to understand an author
and his doctrines; it was not just a report of what the author said and believed.
Rather, "it was, in the first place, a tool of philosophical battle," since one
could defend or condemn a philosophy by way of the characteristics of the
mode of life of those who supported it.11'8
The philosopher was a philosopher because of his existential atlitude, an
attitude that was the foundation of his philosophy and that required that he
undergo a real conversion, in the strongest sense of the word, that he radically
change the d irection of his lifc.189 All six schools of philosophy in the
Hellenistic period present themselves
as choices of life, they demand an existential choice, and whoever
adheres to one of these schools must accept this choice and this option.
One too often represents Stoicism or Epicureanism as a set of abstract
theories about the world invented by Zeno or Chrysippus or Epicurus.
From these theories would spring, as if by accident one could say, a
morality. But it is the reverse that is true. It is the abstract theories th111
arc intended to justify the existential nttitudc. One could 1my , t u c x p n·N11

Introduction

31

it otherwise, that every existential attitude implies a representation of
the world that must necessarily be expressed in a discour,e. But this
discourse alone is not the philosophy, it is only an element of it, for the
philosophy is first of all the existential attitude itself, accompanied by
inner and outer discourses: the latter have as their role to express the
representation of the world that is implied in such and such an
existential attitude, and these discourses allow one at the same time to
rationally justify the attitude and to communicate it to others.190
Hence we begin with a fundamental existential choice on behalf of a style of
life that consists of certain practices, activities, and conduct that are precisely
what Hadot calls "spiritual exercises." This style of life is given concrete form
either in the order of inner discourse and of spiritual activity: medita­
tion, dialogue with oneself, examination of conscience, exercises of the
imagination, such as the view from above on the cosmos or the earth,
or in the order of action and of daily behavior, like the mastery
of oneself, indifference towards ill.different things, the fulfilment of
the duties of social life in Stoicism, the discipline of desires in
Epicurcanism.191
Philosophical discourse, of oneself with oneself and of oneself with others,
will, of course, be needed to justify and communicate these spiritual exercises,
to represent the fundamental existential attitude, but philosophy itself consists
primarily in choosing and living the attitude.
Hadot recognizes that this ancient understanding of philosophy can appear
very far removed from the way in which we now understand the nature of
philosophy. He has pointed to three aspects of the evolution of the repres­
entation of philosophy that have contributed to our current understanding of
it as a purely theoretical, abstract activity, and to our identific.ation of it with
philosophical discourse alone. The first aspect, which Hadot has called "a
natural inclination of the philosophical mind" and "connatural to the
philosopher," is the "constant tendency that the philosopher always has, even
in Antiquity, to satisfy himself with discourse, with the conceptual architec­
ture that he has constructed, without putting into question his own life." 192
This tendency, which was already criticized in antiquity, has been said by
Hadot to be "the perpetual danger of philosophy" - the philosopher is always
tempted to take refuge in, to shut himself up in, the "reassuring universe of
concepts and of discourse instead of going beyond discourse in order to take
upon h im se l f the risk of t h e radical transformation of himself." 193 To this
tendency is opposed the equally natural inclination of the philosophical mind
to Wll n l l o examine i t se l f, tu w11111 to le arn how to live the philosophical life.

Introduction

Faced with the overwhelming reality of life, with worries, anxiety, suffering,
death, philosophical discourse can appear to be nothing but "empty chattering
and a derisive luxury," mere words when what is needed is a new attitude
towards life, one which will produce inner freedom, tranquillity, happiness. 194
It is at these moments that our contrary natural inclinations will be felt to be
most acutely opposed to one another. We will then be forced to ask, "What
is finally most beneficial to the human being as a human being? Is it to
discourse on language, or on being and non-being? Or is it not rather to learn
how to live a human life?" 195 Yet despite our "elementary need" for this
philosophical consciousness and way of life, the history of philosophy also
testifies unambiguously to the powerful tendency of our "self-satisfaction with
theoretical discourse. " 1 96
A second aspect that helps to account for the changed understanding and
representation of philosophy in the modern world has to do with the historical
evolution of philosophy, especially with the relation between philosophy and
Christianity. Although in early Christianity, especially the monastic move­
ments, Christianity itself was presented as a philosophia, a way of life in
conformity with the divine Logos, as the Middle Ages developed, one
witnessed a "total separation" of ancient spiritual exercises, which were no
longer considered a part of philosophy but were integrated into Christian
spirituality, and philosophy itself, which became a "simple theoretical tool" at
the service of theology, an ancilla tl1eo/ogiae.191 Philosophy's role was now to
provide theology with the "conceptual, logical, physical and metaphysical
materials it needed," and the "Faculty of Arts became no more than a
preparation for the Faculty of Theology." 198 Philosophical speculation thus
became a purely abstract and theoretical activity, which was set strictly
apart from theological thought and religious practice and spirituality. l'l'J
No longer a way of life, philosophy became a conceptual construction,
a servant of theology, and the idea of philosophy as a system began to
appear.200
A third aspect underlying our modem representation of philosophy is of a
sociological nature, and can be traced back to the functioning of the
university, as it was created by the medieval church. One central feature of
the university is that it is an institution made up of professors who train other
professors, of specialists who learn how to train other specialists. Unlike in
antiquity, when philosophical teaching was directed towards the human being
so as to form him as a human being, the modern university forms profession­
als who teach future professionals, and thus philosophy, rather than proposing
an art of living, is presented above all as a "technical language reserved for
specialists." 201 As Hadot says, in "modern university philosophy, philosophy
is obviously no longer a way of life, a kind of life, unless it is the kind of life
of the professor of philosophy." 2112 T his sociological requirement of profos­
sionalism, this situation of scholasticism, fncilitnl'cs nnd rcin forccN the wnd·

ency to take refuge in the "comfortable universe of concepts and of
discourses"; 203 it gives this natural tendency a social basis J and impetus,
encouraging the display of a specialized technical language, as if philosophical
depth were exhausted by one's ability to make use of conceptual abstractions
and by one's skill at demonstrating the truth and falsity of various proposi­
tions.
Thus Hadot has provided three reasons, which one could think of as,
respectively, philosophical, historical, and sociological, that help to account
for the representation of philosophy as a purely theoretical activity, and for
the reduction of philosophy to philosophical discourse. But he has not
overlooked the fact that one can find elements of the ancient representation
of philosophy throughout the history of philosophy, that certain of the
"existential aspects of ancient philosophy" have been constantly redis­
covered.:!GI Among the philosophers he has named as exhibiting this ancient
representation are Abelard and the Renaissance humanists, such as Petrarch
and Erasmus. We might think here of the latter's remark with respect to his
Enchiridion Mi/itis Christiani: "Let this book lead to a theological life rather
than theological disputation." 205 Hadot has repeatedly pointed to Montaigne's
Essays, especially "That to Philosophise is to Learn How to Die," as
embodying the ancient exercise of philosophy, referring to the Essays as "the
breviary of ancient philosophy, the manual of the art of living." ™ Among
modern philosophers, Hadot has singled out certain aspects of Descartes'
Meditations, particularly D<..-scartes' advice that one invest some months or at
least weeks meditating on his first and second Meditations, which Hadot says
ultimately shows that for Descartes "evidence can only be perceived thanks
to a spiritual exercise." 207 Hadot also mentions Spinoza's Ethics, and its
emphasis on teaching us how to radically transform ourselves, to accede to
beatitude, to approach the ideal of the sage, as well as Shaftesbury's
remarkable Exercises, inspired by the spiritual exercises of Epictetus and
Marcus Aurelius. 268 He has indicated, too, the continuation of the ancient idea
of philosophy in the French ph ilosophes of the eighteenth century, and in
Kant's ideas of the interest of reason and the primacy of the practical. 209 In
more recent times, we can find the spirit of the ancient philosopher's demand
that we radically change our way of living and of seeing the world in Goethe,
Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Kierkegaard, and, in different ways, in the
young Hegelians and Marx. 2 1 0 In the twentieth century, Hadot points to
Bergson, to Wittgenstein, to Foucault, and to certain aspects of phenomeno­
logy and existentialism as embodying the ancient attitude, practices, and sense
of what philosophy means.21 1 And recently, Hadot has taken up Thoreau's
Walden, finding in his decision to live in the woods Thoreau's undertaking of
a philosophical act . 2 1 2 This constant reoccurrence of the ancient experience of
phih111ophy , side by side with the tendency to understand philosophy as a
cnnccpt u n l H l rucr u rc, :i n 11hHl rnc1 d iscourse, shows how complex and even

34

Introduction

contradictory philosophy's own self-understanding has been. Hadot's work
calls for a detailed historical account of philosophy's representations of
itself, of the various ways in which philosophy imagines itself and
exercises its ideals, and of the factors that contribute to its changing evalu­
ations of itself, to how it views and reviews its own purposes and ultimate
goals.
The permanence of the existential aspects of ancient philosophy has been
highlighted by Hadot in his most recent discussions of what he has called "the
fundamental and universal attitudes of the human being when he searches for
wisdom . " 213 From this point of view, Hadot has discerned a universal
Stoicism, Epicureanism, Platonism, Aristotelianism, Cynicism, and Pyrrhon­
ism, each of which corresponds to a permanent possibility of the human spirit,
and which arc independent of the particular "philosophical or mythical
discourses that have claimed or claim to justify them definitively." m Hadot,
obviously enough, does not believe that we can adopt any of these attitudes
wholly and unmodified, as if we could totally convert to the dogmas and
practices of these schools of ancient philosophy.215 But he does believe that
detached from their outmoded elements and reduced to their essence, to the
extent that "we try to give a meaning to our life, they call upon us to discover
the transformation that could be brought about in our life, if we realized (in
the strongest sense of the term) certain values" that constitute the spirit of
each of these attitudes.21r.
With respect to Stoicism, Hadot has described four features that constitute
the universal Stoic attitude. They arc, first, the Stoic consciousness of "the fact
that no being is alone, but that we make up part of a Whole, constituted by
the totality of human beings as well as by the totality of the cosmos"; second,
the Stoic "feels absolutely serene, free, and invulnerable to the extent that he
has become aware that there is no other evil but moral evil and that the only
thing that counts is the purity of moral consciousness"; third, the Stoic
"believes in the absolute value of the human person," a belief that is "at the
origin of the modern notion of the 'rights of man' "; finally, the Stoic
exercises his concentration "on the present instant, which consists, on the one
hand, in living as if we were seeing the world for the first and for the last
time, and, on the other hand, in being conscious that, in this lived presence
of the instant, we have access to the totality of time and of the world. " 2 1 7
Thus, for Hadot, cosmic consciousness, the purity of moral consciousness, the
recognition of the equality and absolute value of h uman beings, and the
concentration on the present instant represent the universal Stoic attitude.
The universal Epicurean attitude essentially consists, by way of "a certain
discipline and reduction of desires, in returning from pleasures mixed with
pain and suffering to the simple and pure pleasure of ex i sti n g . " 2 1 8 Platonism,
Aristotelianism, Cynicism, and Pyrrhonism also each have 11 u n i vcr11nl chn rnc­
ter, and one of the historical and philosoph ical t11Hks cnl lcd for1 h h�· I IMl1 1 1 'N

Introduction

work is precisely to provide a description of each of ttiese universal existential
attitudes, each of the styles of life that they propose.

/

Moreover, Hadot has insisted that we do not have to choose between these
different universal attitudes, opting for one to the exclusion of all of the
others. The plurality of ancient schools allows us to compare the con­
sequences of the different possible fundamental attitudes of reason, thus
offering us "a privileged field of experimentation . " 219 And we should not be
surprised to find, for example, that there are certain people who are half Stoic
and half Epicurean , who accept and combine "Epicurean sensualism " and
"Stoic communion with nature," who practice both Stoic spiritual exercises
of vigilance and Epicurean spiritual exercises aimed at the true pleasure of
existing.220 That is precisely how Hadot characterizes Goethe, Rousseau, and
Thoreau.22 1 Indeed, Hadot has said that Stoicism and Epicureanism seem to
correspond to "two opposite but inseparable poles of our inner life: tension
and relaxation , duty and serenity, moral consciousness and the joy of

existing. " 222 To these poles of our i nner life, we must add the experiences of
Platonic love and the ascent of the soul as well as of Plotinian unity,
Aristotelian contemplation, Cynic criticism of con ventional values and the
effort to endure every test and ordeal we face, Pyrrhonic suspension of
j udgment and absol ute indifference.223 I t is these experiences and ideals, more
than any concepts, that arc the legacy of ancient phi losophy to Western
civilization .224 The study of ancient philosophy has taught Hadot that "human
reality is so complex that one can only live it by using simultaneously or
successively the most different methods: tension and relaxation, engagement
and detachment, enthusiasm and reserve, certainty and criticism, passion and
ind i fference." 225 Lessons in how to live human reality, with all that that
implies - those are the enduring lessons of ancient philosophy.
In his preface to the mon umental

Dictionnaire des p/1ilosophes antif/ues, Hadot

surveys all of the insufficiently exploited resources that arc available to the
historian of ancient philosophy . He shows how the lists of titles of philosoph­
ical works as well as iconography, papyruses, and inscriptions can all be used
to characterize more fully and accurately the phenomena of philosophy. But
even this vast historical undertaking would not fulfill Hadot's own ultimate
aims:

for the historian of philosophy the task will not be finished for all that:
or more exactly, it should cede place to the philosopher, to the
philosopher who should always remain alive in the historian of philo­
sophy. This final task will consist in asking oneself, with an increased
lucid ity, the decisive question: "What is it to philosophize?"226
Pierre Hndot's own work it se l f prnvokes us to rcask the question of what it

unsettling today as it was centuries ago. In the last analysis, that is what makes

Pierre Hadot not just a consummate h istorian of philosophy, but also a
philosopher for our own times.

the connection between Wittgenstein's literary style and his thought has been a
constant theme of Stanley Cavell's writing. For an early statement, see Cavell,
"The availability of Wittgenstein's later philosophy," in Must We Mean What We
Say?, New York 1 969, pp. 70-3. I bring together Hadot and Cavell's work in
"La decouverte de Thoreau et d'Emerson par Stanley Cavell ou les exercices

Forms of Life and Forms of Discourse
in Ancient Philosophy

Mr Administrator,
Dear colleagues,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
"Each one of you expects two things from me on the occasion of this
inaugural lecture: first of all, that I express my thanks to those who made my
presence here possible and second, that I present the method that I will use
to carry out the task entrusted to me." 1 Petrus Ramus, who held the chair in
rhetoric and philosophy at the College Royal, opened his inaugural lecture,
delivered in Latin, with words to this effect on August 24, 1 55 1 , only twenty
years after the founding of this institution. We sec that the practice of giving
this lecture dates back more than four hundred years and that even at that
time its major themes were already set. And I in turn will remain faithful to
this venerable tradition today.
More than a year has gone by already, dear colleagues, since you decided
to create a chair in the History of Hellenistic and Roman Thought. Shortly
thereafter you honored me by entrusting it to me. How, without being
awkward or superficial, can I express the extent of my gratitude and my joy
at the confidence you have shown toward me?
I am able to see in your decision a reflection of that freedom and
independence of mind that have traditionally characterized the great institu­
tion into which you have welcomed me. For, despite my election, I possess
few of the qualities that would usually attract notice, and the discipline I
represent is not among those in fashion today. In a way I am what the Romans
called a lwmo t1ouus, as I do not belong to that intellectual nobility one of
whose principal titles is traditionally that of "former student of the Ecole
Normalc Supcricure." Moreover, you certainly noticed during my visits to
you that l hick that tmnquil authority con ferred by the use and mastery of

50

Method

the idioms currently spoken in the Republic of Letters. My language, as you will
again ascertain today, is not graced with those mannerisms that now seem to be
required when one ventures to speak of the human sciences. However, several of
you encouraged me to present my candidacy, and during the traditional visits,
which so enriched me, I was extremely touched to find so much sympathy and
interest, particularly among those of you who are specialists in the exact sciences,
for the field of research I have come before you to defend. In other words, I
believe I did not have to convince you - you were persuaded already - of the
need for the College to ensure a way to maintain the close bonds between areas
of teaching and research that are too often artificially separated: Latin and Greek,
philology and philosophy, Hellenism and Christianity. I thus marveled to
discover that at the end of the twentieth century, when many of you on a daily
basis employ technical procedures, modes of reasoning, and representations of the
universe of almost superhuman complexity that open a future to humanity w,e
could not even conceive of earlier, the ideal of humanism, which inspired the
foundation of the College de France, continues to retain for you, undoubtedly in
a more conscious and critical but also more vast, intense, and profound form, all
of its value and significance.
I spoke of a close connection between Greek and Latin, philology and
philosophy, Hellenism and Christianity. I believe that this formulation
corresponds exactly to the inspiration found in the teaching of Pierre
Courcelle, who was my colleague at the Fifth Section of the Ecole Pratique
des Hautes Etudes and to whom I wish to render homage today, indeed,
whom I succeed, if I may say so, in an indirect line, via the appointment of
Rolf Stein. I believe that Pierre Courcelle, who was so brutally taken from us,
is intensely present in the hearts of many of us tonight. For me he was a
teacher who taught me much, but he was also a friend who showed great
concern for me. I will speak now only of the scholar, to recall his immense
output of truly great books, innumc:rable articles, and hundreds of reviews. I
do not know if the scope of this gigantic labor has been sufficiently measured.
The first lines of his great work Lettres grecques en Occident de Macrobe ti
Ctissiodore give a clear idea of the revolutionary direction his work had for his
time. "A substantial book on Hellenistic literature in the West from the death
of Theodosius up to the time of the Justinian reconquest may seem
surprising," wrote Courcelle. First of all, it was surprising for a Latinist to be
interested in Greek literature. However, as Courcelle noted, this Greek
literature made possible the flowering of Latin literature and produced
Cicero, who represented the most complete development of Greco-Roman
culture at its apex, and it was this literature that nearly became a substitute
for Latin when during the second century AD Latin was ove rs ha dowe d by
Greek as a literary language. However, it still must be stated and dl·plorcd
that, despite Courcelle's initiative and exa m pl e and owin g to 11 prd11 1 l ii't• 1 h11 1

has not been totally overcome and that maintains the disastrous break made
in French scholarship between Greek and Latin, what he had to say in 1 943 ,
forty years ago, is unfortunately still true today: "I know of no synthetic work
that examines the Greek influence on the thought and culture of the Roman
Empire. " Once again it was surprising to see a Latinist devote such an
important study to a later period and show that in the fifth and sixth
centuries, a time of so-called decadence, Greek literature had undergone a
remarkable renaissance, which, thanks to Augustine, Macrobius, Boethius,
Martianus Capella, and Cassiodorus, was to make it possible for the European
Middle Ages to maintain contact with Greek thought until the Arab
translations made possible its rediscovery in richer sources. Again, it was
surprising to see a philologist attack problems in the history of philosophy,
showing the key influence exercised on Latin Christian thought by Greek and
p11gan Neoplatonism, not only by Plotinus but - this was an important detail
- by his disciple Porphyry as well. Even more surprising, this philologist
based his conclusions on a rigorously philological method. I mean that he was
not content merely to reveal vague analogies between Neoplatonic and
Christian doctrines or to evaluate influences and originalities in a purely
subjective way - in a word, to rely on rhetoric and inspiration to establish his
conclusions. No, following the example of Paul Henry, the learned editor of
Plotinus who has also been a model of scientific method for me, Courcelle
compared the texts. He discovered what anyone could have seen but no one
had seen before him, that a certain text of Ambrose had been literally
translated from Plotinus, that one of Boethius had been literally translated
from a Greek Neoplatonic commentator on Aristotle. This method made it
possible to establish indisputable facts, to bring the history of thought out of
the vagueness and artistic indistinctness into which certain historians, even
contemporaries of Courcelle, tended to relegate it.
If Les Lettres grecques en Occident provoked surprise, the Recherches sur /es
"Confessions " de saint Augustin, the first edition of which appeared in 1 950,
almost caused a scandal, particularly because of the interpretation Courcelle
proposed for Augustine's account of his own conversion. Augustine recounts
that as he was weeping beneath a fig tree, overcome with pressing questions
and heaping bitter reproaches upon himself for his indecision, he heard a
child's voice repeating, "Take it ip and read . " He then opened Paul's Epistles
at random, as if he were drawing a lot, and read the passage that converted
him. Alerted by his profound knowledge of Augustine's literary procedures
and the traditions of Christian allegory, Courcelle dared to write that the fig
tree could well have a purely symbolic value, representing the "mortal shadow
of sin," and that the child's voice could also have been introduced in a purely
l i t e ra ry way to ind icate allegorically the divine response to Augustine's
q uest ion i n g . Co u rce l l e did n o t suspect the uproar his interpretation would
unkn11h. II l11i;1 ed nlmmil l w cn t y ye1m; , The greatest names in international

Method

patristics entered the fray. Obviously I do not wish to rekindle the flames
here. But I would like to stress how interesting his position was from a
methodological point of view. Indeed it began with the very simple principle
that a text should be interpreted in light of the literary genre to which it
belongs. Most of Courcelle's opponents were victims of the modern, ana­
chronistic prejudice that consists in believing that Augustine's Confessions is
primarily an autobiographical account. Courcelle on the contrary had under­
stood that the Confessions is essentially a theological work, in which each scene
may take on a symbolic meaning. One is always surprised, for example, by
the length of Augustine's account of his stealing pears while he was an
adolescent. But this is explained by the fact that these fruits stolen from a
garden become symbolically, for Augustine, the forbidden fruit stolen from
the Garden of Eden, and the episode gives him the opportunity to develop a
theological reflection on the nature of sin. In this literary genre, then, it is
extremely difficult to distinguish between a symbolic enactment and an
account of a historical event.
A very large part of Courcellc's work was devoted to tracing the fortunes
of great themes such as "Know thyself" or great works such as Augustine's
Confessions or Boethius' Ctm$o/ation of Phi/O$t>Pkl' in the history of Western
thought. Not the least original of his contributions, appearing in several of
the major works he wrote from this perspective, was his association of literary
study and iconographical inquiry, pertaining, for example, to illustrations
produced throughout the ages for the Confessions or the Consolation. These
iconographical studies, which are fundamental in reconstructing the history
of religious mentalities and imagination, were all undertaken in collaboration
with Mrs Jeanne Courcelle, whose great knowledge of the techniques of art
history and iconographic description greatly enriched her husband's work.
This all-too-brief recollection permits a glimpse, I hope, of the general
development, the itinerary, of Courcelle's research. Starting from late anti­
quity, he was led to go back in time, especially in his book on , the theme of
"Know thyself," toward the philosoP.hY of the imperial and Hellenistic period,
and, on the other hand, to follow, across the years, ancient works, themes,
and images as they evolved in the Western tradition. Finally, it is my hope
that this history of Hellenistic and Roman thought I am now going to present
to you reflects the spirit and the profound orientation of Courcelle's teaching
and work.
According to the scheme given by Petrus Ramus, I have just spoken of what
he himself called the ratio muneris officiique 11ostri: the object and method of
the teaching entrusted to me. In the title of my chair, the word tliought can
seem very vague; indeed it can be applied to an immense and undefined
domain ranging from politics to art, from poetry to sci en ce and 11h i ln11011hy,
or religion and magic. I n any event, t h e term invites one to 11111 kl1 hr1,11 1h 1 11king

excursions into the vast world of wondrous and fascinating works produced
during the great period of the history o ( humanity that I propose to study.
Perhaps we will accept this invitation from time to time, but our intention is
to turn to the essential, to recognize the typical or the significant, to attempt
to grasp the Urphiinomene, as Goethe would say. And specifically, philosophia,
the way the term was understood then, is one of the typical and significant
phenomena of the Greco-Roman world. It is this above all which engages our
attention. Nevertheless, we h ave preferred to speak of "Heilenistic and Roman
thought" to reserve the right to follow this philosophia in its most varied
manifestations and above all to eliminate the preconceptions the word
philosophy may evoke in the modem mind.
"Hellenistic and Roman": these words themselves open an immense period
before us. Our history begins with the highly symbolic event represented by
Alexander's fantastic expedition and with the emergence of the world called
Hellenistic, that is, with the emergence of this new form of Greek civilization
beginning from the moment when Alexander's conquests and, in their wake,
the rise of kingdoms extended this civilization into the barbarian world from
Egypt to the borders of India, and then brought it into contact with the most
diverse nations and civilizations. The result is a kind o f d i stance, a historical
distance, between Hellenistic thought and the Greek tradition preceding it.
Our history then covers the rise of Rome, which will lead to the destruction
of the Hellenistic kingdoms, brought to completion in 30 BC with Cleopatra's
death. After that will come the expansion of the Roman empire, the rise and
triumph of Christianity, the barbarian invasions, and the end of the Western
empire.
We have j ust traversed a millennium. But from the standpoint of the
history of thought, this long period must be treated as a whole. Indeed it is
impossible to know Hellenistic thought without recourse to later documents,
those of the imperial era and late antiquity, which reveal it to us; and it is
equally impossible to understand Roman thought without taking its Greek
background into account.
We need to recognize from the outset that almost all of Hellenistic
literature, principally its philosophical productions, has disappeared. The
Stoic philosopher Chrysippus, to cite only one example, among many, wrote
seven hundred works, all of which are lost; only a few fragments have come
down to us. We would undoubtedly have a very different idea of Hellenistic
philosophy if this gigantic catastrophe had not occurred. How can we hope
to compensate in some way for this irreparable loss? Obviously, there is the
chance that discoveries might sometimes bring unknown texts to light. For
example, in the mid-eighteenth century, an Epicurean library was found at
Herculaneum. It con tained texts of remarkable interest, not only for the
knowledge it provided of that school but also regarding Stoicism and

mine, in an exemplary manner, these precious documents, endlessly improv­
ing both the texts and the commentaries. Another example: during the
excavations, led for fifteen years by our colleague Paul Bernard in A"i
Khanoun, near the border between A fghanistan and the USSR, to find the
remains of a Hellenistic town of the kingdom of Bactrian, a philosophical text,
unfortunately terribly mutilated, was discovered. The presence of such a
document in such a place suffices, furthermore , to make one recognize the
extraordinary expansion of Hellenism brought on by the Alexandrian con­
q uests . Most likely it dates from the third or second century BC and
represents a fragment, unfortunately very difficult to read, of a d ialogue in
which it is possible to recognize a passage i nspired by the Aristotelian
tradition.2
Except for finds of this type, which are extremely rare, one is obliged to
exploit existing texts to their fu llest, which often are of a much later date, in
order to find information about the Hellenistic period . Obviously, it is
necessary to begin with the Greek texts. Despite many excellent studies, much
remains to be done in this area. For example, th e collections of philosophical
fragments that have come down to us need to be completed or updated . Hans
von Arnim's collection of fragments from the earliest Stoics is exactly eighty
years old and requires serious revision . Moreover, there exists no collection
of fragments for the Academicians from the period that runs from Arccsilas
to Philo of Larissa . On the other hand, mines of information , such as the
works of Philo of Alexandria, Galen, Athenaeus, and Lucian, or the comment­
aries on Plato and Aristotle written at the end of antiquity, have never been
systematically made use of. But the Latin writers are also ind ispensable to this
line of inquiry. For although the Latinists do not always agree, one has to
admit that Latin literature, except for the historians (and even there!), is
comprised largely of either translations, paraphrases, or imitations of Greek
texts. Sometimes this is completely evident, for one can compare line by line
and word for word the Greek originals that were translated or paraphrased by
the Latin writers; sometimes the Latin writers themselves also quote their
Greek sources; sometimes, finally, one can legitimately speculate about these
influences with the help of reliable evidence. Thanks to the Latin writers, a
large part of Hellenistic thought was preserved . Without Cicero, Lu<..Tetius,
Seneca, or Aulus Gellius, many aspects of the philosophy of the Epicureans,
Stoics, and Academicians would be i rretrievably lost. The Latins of the
Christian period are moreover j ust as precious: without Marius Victorious,
Augustine, Ambrose of Milan, Macrobius, Boethius, or Martianus Capella, how
many Greek sources would

be completely

unknown to us! Two projects are thus

inseparable: on the one hand, to explain Latin thought in light of its Greek
background, and, on the other hand, to rediscover Greek though t , which has
been lost to us, in the works of Latin writers. If both these tnsk11 11rc 11 1 he <.'R rr i cd
out, any separation of Gr<.'Ck and Latin scholarship is tot nllr impc 111 11 ihlr.

Here w e are witness t o the great cultural event o f the West, the emergence
of a Latin philosophical language translated from the Greek. Once again, it
would be necessary to make a systematic study of the formation of this
technical vocabulary that, thanks to Cicero, Seneca, Tertullian, Victorinus,
Calcidius, Augustine, and Boethius, would leave its mark, by way of the
Middle Ages, on the birth of modern thought. Can it be hoped that one day,
with current technical means, it will be possible to compile a complete lexicon
of the correspondences of philosophical terminology in Greek and Latin?
Furthermore, lengthy commentaries would be needed, for the most interest­
ing task would be to analyze the shifts in meaning that take place in the
movement from one language to another. In the case of the ontological
vocabulary the translation of ousia by subs1an1ia, for example, is justly famous
and has again recently inspired some remarkable studies. This brings us once
more to a phenomenon we discretely alluded to earlier with the word
phi/osophia, and which we will encounter throughout the present discussion:
the misunderstandings, shifts or losses in meaning, the reinterpretations,
sometimes even to the point of misreadings, that arise once tradition,
translation, and exegesis coexist. So our history of Hellenistic and Roman
thought will consist above all in recognizing and analyzing the evolution of
meanings and significance.
It is precisely the need to explain this evolution that justifies our intention
to study this period as a whole. Translations from the Greek into Latin are
indeed only a particular aspect of this vast process of unification, that is, of
Hellenization, of the different cultures of the Mediterranean world, Europe,
and Asia Minor that took place progressively from the fourth century BC up
until the end of the ancient world. Hellenic thought had the strange capacity
to absorb the most diverse mythical and conceptual themes. All the cultures
of the Mediterranean world thus eventually expressed themselves in the
categories of Hellenic thought, but at the price of important shifts in meaning
that distorted the content of the myths, the values, and .the wisdom of
each culture, as well as the content of the Hellenic tradition itself. First
the Romans, who were able to retain their language, then the Jews, and
then the Christians fell into this sort of trap. Such was the price for the
creation of the remarkable linguistic and cultural community that charac­
terizes the Greco-Roman world. This process of unification also ensured a
surprising continuity at the heart of philosophical and religious literary
traditions.
This evolutionary continuity and progressive unification can be seen most
remarkably in the area of philosophy. At the beginning of the Hellenistic
period an extraordinary proliferation of schools emerged in the wake of the
Sophist movement and the Socratic experience. But beginning with the
t h i rd ccntui·y BC a k i nd of sorting out occurred . In Athens the only schools

well-organized institutions: the school of Plato, the school of Aristotle and
Theophrastus, the school of Epicurus, and that of Zeno and Chrysippus. In
addition to these four schools there were two movements that are primarily
spiritual traditions: Skepticism and Cynicism. After the institutional founda­
tions of the schools in Athens collapsed at the end of the Hellenistic period,
private schools and even officially subsidized teaching posts continued to be
established throughout the empire, and here the spiritual traditions of their
founders were their reference points. Thus, for six centuries, from the third
century BC until the third century AD, we witness a surprising stability
among the six traditions we have just mentioned. However, beginning with
the third century AD, Platonism, in the culmination of a movement underway
since the first century, yet again at the price of subtle shifts in meaning and
numerous reinterpretations, came to absorb both Stoicism and Aristotelianism
in an original synthesis, while all the other traditions were to become
marginal. This unifying phenomenon is of major historical importance.
Thanks to the writers of lesser antiquity but also to the Arab translations and
the Byzantine tradition, this Neoplatonist synthesis was to dominate all the
thought of the Middle Ages and Renaissance and was to provide, in some
fashion, the common denominator among Jewish, Christian, and Moslem
theologies and mysticisms.
We have just given a very brief outline of the main paths of the history of
the philosophical schools of antiquity. But as a history of ancient phi/osophia,
our history of Hellenistic and Roman thought is less focused on studying the
doctrinal diversities and particularities of these different schools than it is on
attempting to describe the very essence of the phenomenon of philosophia and
finding the traits shared by the "philosopher" or by "philosophizing" in
antiquity. We must try to recognize in some way the strangeness of this
phenomenon, in order then to try to understand better the strangeness of its
permanence throughout the whole history of Western thought. Why, you may
ask, speak of strangeness when philosop/1ia is a very general and common
thing? Doesn't a philosophical quality color all of Hellenistic and Roman
thought? Weren't the generalization and popularization of philosophy charac­
teristics of the time? Philosophy is found everywhere - in speeches, novels,
poetry, science, art. However, we must not be deceived . These general ideas,
these commonplaces that may adorn a literary work, and true "philosophiz­
ing" are separated by an abyss. Indeed, to be a philosopher implies a rupture
with what the skeptics called bios, that is, daily life, when they criticized other
philosophers for not observing the common conduct of life, the usual manner
of seeing and acting, which for the Skeptics consisted in respecting customs
and laws, practicing a craft or plying a trade, satisfying bodily needs, and
having the faith in appearances indispensable to action . I t iH true: that even
while the Skeptics chose to conform to the: common cun d m· 1 of l i fe, they
remained philosophers, since they pract iced an c lCcrciNC' dt•11111111l l n 11 1111mc1 h i 111<

rather strange, the suspension of judgment, and aiming at a goal, uninter­
rupted tranquillity and serenity of the soul, that the commo1.1 conduct of life
hardly knew.
This very rupture between the philosopher and the conduct of everyday life
is strongly felt by non-philosophers. In the works of comic and satiric authors,
philosophers were portrayed as bizarre, if not dangerous characters. It is true,
moreover, that throughout all of antiquity the number of charlatans who
passed themselves off as philosophers must have been considerable, and
Lucian, for example, freely exercised his wit at their expense. Jurists too
considered philosophers a race apart. According to Ulpian, in the litigation
between professors and their debtors the authorities did not need to concern
themselves with philosophers, for these people professed to despise money. A
regulation made by the emperor Antoninus Pious on salaries and compensa­
tions notes that if a philosopher haggles over his possessions, he shows he is
no philosopher. Thus philosophers are strange, a race apart. Strange indeed
are those Epicureans, who lead a frugal life, practicing a total equality between
the men and women inside their philosophical circle - and even between
married women and courtesans; strange, too, those Roman Stoics who
disinterestedly administer the provinces of the empire entrusted to them and
are the only ones to take seriously the laws promulgated against excess;
strange as well this Roman Platonist, the Senator Rogatianus, a disciple of
Plotinus, who on the very day he is to assume his functions as praetor gives
up his responsibilities, abandons all his possessions, frees his slaves, and cats
only every other day. Strange indeed all those philosophers whose behavior,
without being inspired by religion, nonetheless completely breaks with the
customs and habits of most mortals.
By the time of the Platonic dialogues Socrates was called atopos, that is,
"unclassifiable." What makes him atopos is precisely the fact that he is a
"philo-sopher" in the etymological sense of the word; that is, he is in love
with wisdom. For wisdom, says Diotima in Plato's Symposium, is not a human
state, it is a state of perfection of being and knowledge that can only be divine.
It is the love of this wisdom, which is foreign to the world, that makes the
philosopher a stranger in it.
So each school will elaborate its rational depiction of this state of perfection
in the person of the sage, and each will make an effort to portray him. It is
true that this transcendent ideal will be deemed almost inaccessible; according
to some schools there never was a wise man, while others say that perhaps
there were one or two of them, such as Epicurus, this god among men, and
still others maintain that man can only attain this state during rare, fleeting
moments. I n this transcendent norm established by reason, each school will
cxprci;s i ts own vision of the world, its own style of life, and its idea of the
perfect man . ThiN i s why in every school the description of this transcendent
norm u l t im1uclv coindth.'11 wit h t h e ra t ional idea of God . Michelet remarked

Method

58

very profoundly, "Greek religion culminated with its true god, the sage." We
can interpret this remark, which Michelet does not develop, by noting that
the moment philosophers achieve a rational conception of God based on the
model of the sage, Greece surpasses its mythical representation of its gods. Of
course, classical descriptions of the sage depict the circumstances of human
life and take pleasure in describing how the sage would respond to this or that
situation, but the beatitude the wise man resolutely maintains throughout his
difficulties is that of God himself. Seneca asks what the sage's life would be
in solitude, if he were in prison or exile, or cast upon the shores of a desert
island. And he answers that it would be the life of Zeus (that is, for the Stoics,
the life of universal Reason), when, at the end of each cosmic period, after
the activity of nature has ceased, he devotes himself freely to his thoughts;
like Zeus the sage would enjoy the happiness of being self-sufficient. Thus
the thoughts and will of the Stoic wise man completely coincide with the
thoughts, will, and development of Reason immanent to the evolution of the
Cosmos. As for the Epicurean sage, he, like the gods, watches the infinity of
worlds arising out of atoms in the infinite void; nature is sufficient for his
needs, and nothing ever disturbs the peace of his soul. For their part, the
Platonic and Aristotelian sages raise themselves in subtly different ways, by
their life of the mind, to the realm of the divine Mind itself.
Now we have a better understanding of atopia, the strangeness of the
philosopher in the human world. One does not know how to classify him, for
he is neither a sage nor a man like other men. He knows that the normal,
natural state of men should be wisdom, for wisdom is nothing more than the
vision of things as they are, the vision of the cosmos as it is in the light of
reason , and wisdom is also nothing more than the mode of being and living
that should correspond to this vision. But the philosopher also knows that this
wisdom is an ideal state, almost inaccessible. For such a man, daily life, as it
is organized and lived by other men, must necessarily appear abnormal, like
a state of madness, unconsciousness, and ignorance of reality. And nonethe­
less he must live this life every day, in this world in which he feels himself a
stranger and in which others perceive him to be one as well. And it is
precisely in this daily life that he must seek to attain that way of life which is
utterly foreign to the everyday world . The result is a perpetual conflict
between the philosopher's effort to see things as they are from the standpoint
of universal nature and the conventional vision of things underlying human
society, a conflict between the life one should live and the customs and
conventions of daily life. This conflict can never be totally resolved . The
Cynics, in their refusal of the world of social convention, opt for a total break.
On the contrary, others, such as the Skeptics, fully accept socinl convention,
while keeping their inner peace. Others, the Epicure11ni;, for c 1 1 1ur1 plc, 11ttempt

greatest difficulties, to live their everyday and even their public lives in a
"philosophical" manner. In any event, for all of them, the philosophical life
will be an effort to live and think according to the norm of wisdom, it will
be a movement, a progression, though a never-ending one, toward this
transcendent state.
Each school, then, represents a form of life defined by an ideal of wisdom.
The result is that each one has its corresponding fundamental inner attitude
- for example, tension for the Stoics or relaxation for the Epicureans - and
its own manner of speaking, such as the Stoic use of percussive dialectic or
the abundant rhetoric of the Academicians. But above all every school
practices exercises designed to ensure spiritual progress toward the ideal state
of wisdom, exercises of reason that will be, for the soul, analagous to the
athlete's training or to the application of a medical cure. Generally, they
consist, above all, of self-control and meditation . Self-control is fundamentally
being attentive to oneself: an unrelaxing vigilance for the Stoics, the renunci­
ation of unnecessary desires for the Epicureans. It always involves an effort
of will, thus faith in moral freedom and the possibility of self-improvement;
an acute moral consciousness honed by spiritual direction and the practice of
examining one's conscience; and lastly, the kind of practical exercises
described with such remarkable precision particularly by Plutarch: controlling
one's anger, curiosity, speech, or love of riches, beginning by working on what
is easiest in order gradually to acquire a firm and stable character.
Of first importance is "meditation," which is the "exercise" of reason;
moreover, the two words are synonymous from an etymological point of view.
Unlike the Buddhist meditation practices of the Far East, Greco-Roman
philosophical meditation is not linked to a corporeal attitude but is a purely
rational, imaginative, or intuitive exercise that can take extremely varied
forms. First of all it is the memorization and assimilation of the fundamental
dogmas and rules of life of the school. Thanks to this exercise, the vision of
the world of the person who strives for spiritual progress will be completely
transformed. In particular, philosophical meditation on the essential dogmas
of physics, for example the Epicurean contemplation of the genesis of worlds
in the infinite void or the Stoic contemplation of the rational and necessary
unfolding of cosmic events, can lead to an exercise of the imagination in
which human things appear of little importance in the immensity of space and
time. It is necessary to try to have these dogmas and rules for living "ready
to hand" if one is to be able to conduct oneself like a philosopher under all
of life's circumstances. Moreover, one has to be able to imagine these
circu mstances in advance in order to be ready for the shock of events. In all
t he schools, for various reasons, philosophy will be especially a meditation
u 1mn death and an attentive concentra tion on the present moment in order to
t•n joy i t or l i ve it in full consciousncs11. In a l l these exercises, all the means

effect. In parti cu lar , this consciou sly w i l led a pplic ation of rhetoric explains th e
imp ression of pessimism that some readers believe they d iscern in the
Meditations of Marcus Au reli u s . All images are suitable for h im if they strike
the imagination and make the reader conscious of the illusions and conven­
tions of mankind.
The rel ation sh ip between theory and practice i n th e philosophy of this
p e riod must be understood from the p ers pec ti ve of th ese exercises of
meditation. Theory is never considered an end in itself; it is clearly and
d ec i d e d l y put in the service of practice. Epicurus is explicit on this point: the
goal of the science of nature is to obtain the soul's serenity. Or else, as among
the Aristotelians, one is more attached to theoretical activ it y considered as a
way of life t ha t brings an almost divine pl easure and happiness than to the
theories themselves. Or, as in the Academicians' school or for the skep tics ,
theoretical activity is a critical activity. Or, as among th e Pla toni s ts , abstract
theory is not considered to be true knowledge: as Porphyry says, "Beatific
con temp lation does not consist of the accumulation of arguments or a
storehouse of learned knowledge, but in us theory must become nature and

life itself." And, according to Plotinus, one cannot know the soul if one does
not purify oneself of one's passions in order to exp er ien ce in oneself the
transcendence of the soul with respect to the body, and one cannot know the
principle of all things if one has no t had the ex p e r i ence of union with it.
To make possible these exercises in med ita tio n , beginners are exposed to
maxims or summaries of the principal dogmas of the school. Epicurus' Letters,
which Diogenes Laertius preserved for us, are intended to play this role. To
ensure that these d ogma s have a great s pi r it u a l effectiveness, they must be
p res ented in the form of short, striking formulae, as in Epicurus' Principal
Doctrines, or in a rigo ro usl y s ystem a t i c form, such as th e Letter to Herodotus
by the same author, which permitted the disciple to grasp in a kind of single
intuition the essen ti a l s of the doctrine in order to have it more easily at hand.
In this case the concern for systema ti c coherence was subordinated to spiritual
effectiveness.

The dogmas and methodological principles of each school are not open to
discussion. In this period, to philosophize is to choose a school, convert to i ts
way of life, and accept its dogmas. This is why t he core of the fundamental
d ogmas and rules of life for P lato n is m , A ristotel i anis m , S toi c i sm , and
Epicureanism remained unchanged th ro u ghou t an tiq u ity . Even the sci en ti sts
of antiquity always were affiliated with a philosophical school: the develop­
ment of their mathematical and astronomical theorems changed nothing of the
fundamental principles of the school to w hi ch they c laim e d a ll e gi ance .
This does not mean that theoretical re fle ct ion and elabora tion arc a bse n t

points issuing from them on which there was not unanimity i n the school.
This type of investigation is always reserved for the more advanced students,
for whom it is an exercise of reason that strengthens them in their philosoph­
ical life. Chrysippus, for example, felt himself capable of finding the
arguments justifying the Stoic dogmas established by Zeno and Cleanthes,
which led him, moreover, to disagree with them not concerning these dogmas
but on the way of establishing them. Epicurus, too, leaves the discussion and
study of points of detail to the more advanced students, and much later the
same attitude will be found in Origen, who assigns the "spiritual ones" the
task of seeking, as he himself says, by way of exercise, the "hows" and "whys"
and of discussing these obscure and secondary q uestions. This effort of
theoretical reflection can result in the composition of enormous works.
Obviously, these systematic treaties and scholarly commentaries, such as
Origen's treatise on Principles or Proclus' Elements of Theology, very legitim­
ately attract the attention of the historian of philosophy. The study of the
progress of thought in these great texts must be one of the principal tasks in
a reflection on the phenomenon of philosophy. However, it must be recog­
nized that generally speaking the philosophical works of Greco-Roman
antiquity almost always perplex the contemporary reader. I do not refer only
to the general public, but even to specialists in the field. One could compile
a whole anthology of complaints made against ancient authors by modern
commentators, who reproach them for their bad writing, contradictions, and
lack of rigor and coherence. Indeed, it is my astonishment both at these critics
and at the universality and persistence of the phenomenon they condemn that
inspires the reflections I have just presented, as well as those I wish to turn
to now.
It seems to me, indeed, that in order to understand the works of the
philosophers of antiquity we must take account of all the concrete conditions
in which they wrote, all the constraints that weighed upon them : the
framework of the school, the very nature of philosopl1ia, literary genres,
rhetorical rules, dogmatic imperatives, and traditional modes of reasoning.
One cannot read an ancient author the way one does a contemporary author
(which does not mean that contemporary authors are easier to understand
than those of antiquity). In fact, the works of antiquity are produced under
entirely different conditions than those of their modern counterparts. I will
not discuss the problem of material support: the volumen or codex, each of
which has its own constraints. But I do want to stress the fact that written
works in the period we study arc never completely free of the constraints
imposed by oral transmission. In fact, it is an exaggeration to assert, as has
still been done recent ly, that Greco-Roman civilization early on became a
civililnt ion of writing a n d that one can thus treat, methodologically, the
p h i lmmphknl workN of n n t i q u i t y l i k e nny othc:r w r i t t en work .

For the written works of this period remain closely tied to oral conduct.
Often they were dictated to a scribe. And they were intended to be read aloud,
either by a slave reading to his master or by the reader himself, since in
antiquity reading customarily meant reading aloud, emphasizing the rhythm
of the phrase and the sounds of the words, which the author himself had
already experienced when he dictated his work. The ancients were extremely
sensitive to these effects of sound. Few philosophers of the period we study
resisted this magic of the spoken word, not even the Stoics, not even Plotinus.
So if oral literature before the practice of writing imposed rigorous constraints
on expression and obliged one to use certain rhythmic, stereotypic, and
traditional formulae conveying images and thoughts independent, if one may
say so, of the author's will, this phenomenon is not foreign to written
literature to the degree that it too must concern itself with rhythm .md sound .
To take an extreme but very revealing example, the use of poetic meter in De

rerum nalura dictates the recourse to certain somewhat stereotypical formulae
and keeps Lucretius from freely using the technical vocabulary of Epicurean­
ism that he should have employed .
This relationship between the written and the spoken word thus explains
certain aspects of the works of antiquity. Quite often the work proceeds by
the associations of ideas, without systematic rigor. The work retains the starts
and stops, the hesitations, and the repetitions of spoken discourse. Or else,
after re-reading what he has written, the author introduces a somewhat forced
systematization by adding transitions, introductions, or conclusions to differ­
ent parts of the work .
More than other literature, philosophical works arc linked to oral trans­
mission because ancient philosophy itself is above all oral in character.
Doubtless there are occasions when someone was converted by reading a
book, but one would then hasten to the philosopher to hear him speak,
question him, and carry on discussions with him and other disciples in a
community that always serves as a place of discussion . In matters of
philosophical teaching, writing is only an aid to memory, a last resort that will
never replace the living word .
True education is a lways oral because only the spoken word makes dialogue
possible, that is, it makes it possible for the disciple to discover the truth
himself amid the interplay of questions and answers and also for the master
to adapt his teaching to the needs of the disciple. A number of philosophers,
and not the least among them, did not wish to write, thinking, as did
Plato and without doubt correctly, that what is inscribed in the soul by the

Some of these works, moreover, are directly related to the activity of
teaching. They may be either a summary the teacher drafted. in preparing his
course or notes taken by students during the course, or else they may be texts
written with care but intended to be read during the course by the professor
or a student. In all these cases, the general movement of thought, its
unfolding, what could be called its own temporality, is regulated by the
temporality of speech. It is a very heavy constraint, whose full rigor I am
experiencing today.
Even texts that were written in and for themselves are closely linked to the
activity of teaching, and their literary genre reflects the methods of the
schools. One of the exercises esteemed in the schools consists of discussing,
either dialectically, that is, in the form of questions and answers, or
rhetorically, that is, in a continuous discourse, what were called "theses," that
is, theoretical positions presented in the form of questions: Is death an
evil? Is the wise man ever angry? This provides both training in the mastery
of the spoken word and a properly philosophical exercise. The largest portion
of the philosophical works of antiquity, for example those of Cicero, Plutarch,
Seneca, Plotinus, and more generally those classified by the moderns as
belonging to what they called the genre of diatribe, correspond to this
exercise. They discuss a specific question, which is posed at the outset of the
work and which normally requires a yes or no answer. In these works, the
course of thought consists in going back to general principles that have been
accepted in the school and arc capable of resolving the problem in question .
This search to find principles to solve a given problem thus encloses thought
within narrowly defined limits. Different works written by the same author
and gu ided according to this "zetctic" method , "one that seeks," will not
necessarily be coherent on all points because the details of the argument in
each work will be a function of the question asked .
A nother school exercise is the reading and exegesis of the authoritative texts
of each school. Many literary works, particularly the long commentaries from
the end of antiquity, are the result of this exercise. More generally, a large
number of the philosophical works from that time utilize a mode of exegetical
thinking. Most of the time, discussing a "thesis" consists in discussing not
the problem in itself but the meaning that one should give to Plato's or
Aristotle's statements concerning this problem. Once this convention has been
taken into account, one docs in fact discuss the question in some depth, but
this is done by skillfully giving Platonic or Aristotelian statements the
meanings that support the very solution one wishes to give to the problem
under consideration . Any possible meaning is true p rovided it coheres with
the t ruth one believes one has discovered in the text. In this way there slowly

fundamental dogmas. It is precisely the third ph i losophical literary genre, the
systematic treatise, that proposes a rational ordering of the whole of doctrine,

which sometimes is presented, as in the case of Proclus, as a
that is, according to the model of Euclid's

returns to the principles necessary to resolve a specific question but sets down
the principles directly and deduces their consequences. These works are, so
to speak, "more written " than the others. They often comprise a long
sequence of books and are marked by a vast, overarching design . But, like the

Summae theologicae of the Middle-Ages that they prefigure, these works must
themselves also be understood from the perspective of dialectical and
exegetical scholarly exercises.
Unlike their modem counterparts, none of these philosophical productions,
even the systematic works, is addressed to everyone, to a general audience,
but they are intended first of all for the group formed by the members of the
school; often they echo problems raised by the oral teaching. Only works of
propaganda are addressed to a wider audience.
Moreover, while he writes the philosopher often extends his activity as
spiritual director that he exercises in his school. In such cases the work may
be addressed to a particular disciple who needs encouragement or who finds
himself in a special difficulty . Or else the work may be adapted to the spiritual
level of the addressees. Not all the details of the system can be explained to
beginners; many details can be revealed only to those further along the path .
Above all, the work, even if it is apparently theoretical and systematic, is
written not so much to inform the reader of a doctrinal content but to form
him, to make him traverse a certain itinerary in the course of which he will
make spiritual progress. This procedure is clear in the works of Plotinus and
Augustine, in which all the detours, starts and stops, and digressions of the
work are formative elements. One must always a pproach a philosophical work
of antiquity with this idea of spiritual progress in mind . For the Platonists,
for example, even mathematics is used to train the soul to raise itself from the
sensible to the intelligible. The overal l organization of a work and its mode
of exposition may always answer to such preoccupations.
Such then are the many constraints that are exercised on the ancient author
and that often perplex the modem reader with respect to both what is said
and the way in which it is said. Understanding a work of antiquity requires
placing it in the group from which it emanates, in the tradition of its dogmas,
its literary genre, and requires understanding its goals. One must attempt to
distinguish what the author was required to say, what he could or could not
say, and, above all, what he meant to say. For the ancient author's art consists
in his skillfully using, in order to arrive at his goals, a l l of the constraints that
weigh upon him as well as the models furnished by the i-rnllition . MoHt of t h e

pure a n d simple to quotation o r paraphrase, this practice includes - a n d this
is the most characteristic example - the literal use of foi;mulae or words
employed by the earlier tradition to which the author often gives a new
meaning adapted to what he wants to say. This is the way that Philo, a Jew,
uses Platonic formulae to comment on the Bible, or Ambrose, a Christian,
translates Philo's text to present Christian doctrines, the way that Plotinus
uses words and whole sentences from Plato to convey his experience. What
matters first of all is the prestige of the ancient and traditional formula, and
not the exact meaning it originally had . The idea itself holds less interest than
the prefabricated elements in which the writer believes he recognizes his own
thought, elements that take on an unexpected meaning and purpose when
they are integrated into a literary whole. This sometimes brilliant reuse of
prefabricated elements gives an impression of "bricolage," to take u p a word
currently in fashion , not only among anthropologists hut among biologists.
Thought evolves by incorporating prefabricated and pre-existing elements,
which are given new meaning as they become integrated into a rational
system. It is difficult to say what is most extraordinary about this process of
integration: contingency, chance, irrationality, the very absurdity resulting
from the elements used, or, on the contrary, the stran ge power of reason to
integrate and systematize these disparate elements and to give them a new
meaning.
An extremely significant example of this con ferring of a new meaning can
be seen in the final lines of Edmund Husserl 's Cartesian

Meditations.

Summing up his own theory, Husserl writes, "The Delphic oracle yv ro6t

OEavi-o v [know thyself] has acquired a new meaning. . . . One must first lose

the world by the

sentence of Augustine's, "Do not lose your way from without, return to
yourself, it is in the inner man that truth dwells," offers Husserl a convenient
formula for expressing and summarizing his own conception of consciousness.
It is true that Husserl gives this sentence a new meaning. Augustine's "inner
man" becomes the "transcendental ego" for Husserl, a knowing subject who
regains the world in "a universal self-consciousness . " Augustine never could
have conceived of his "inner man" in these terms. And nonetheless one
understands why Husserl was tempted to use this formula. For Augustine's
sentence admirably summarizes the whole spirit of Greco-Roman philosophy
that prepares the way for both Descartes ' Meditations and Husserl's Cartesian

Meditations. And by the same procedure of taking up such a formula again,

we ou rselves can apply to ancient philosophy what Husserl says of his own

66

Method

for whom the philosopher recognizes the presence of divine reason in the
human self and who opposes his moral consciousness, which depends on him
alone, to the rest of the universe. This new meaning appeared even more
clearly among the Neoplatonists, who identify what they call the true self with
the founding intellect of the world and even with the transcendent unity that
founds all thought and all reality . In Hellenistic and Roman thought this
movement, of which Husserl speaks, is thus already outlined, according to
which one loses the world in order to find it again in universal self-conscious­
ness. Thus Husserl consciously and explicitly presents himself as the heir to
the tradition of "Know thyself " that runs from Socrates to Augustine to
Descartes. But that is not all. This example, borrowed from Husserl, better
enables us to understand concretely how these conferrals of new meaning can
be realized in antiquity as well. Indeed, the expression

in interiore homine
habitat veritas, as my friend and colleague Goulven Madec has pointed out to
me, is an allusion to a group of words borrowed from chapter 3, verses 1 6
and 1 7, o f Paul's letter to the Ephesians, from a n ancient Latin version , to be
exact, in which the text appears as in interiore homi11e Christum ha b itare. But
these words are merely a purely material conjunction that exists only in this
Latin version and do not correspond to the contents of Paul's thought, for
they belong to two different clauses of the sentence. On the one hand, Paul
wishes for Christ to dn1el/ in the heart of his disciples through faith, and, on
the other hand, in the preceding clause, he wishes for God to allow his

to be strengthened by the divine Spirit in the inner man, in interiorem
hominem, as the Vulgate has it. So the earlier Latin version, by combining in
interiure homine and Christum hab itare, was either a mistranslation or was
miscopied . The Augustinian formula, in interiore homine habitat veritas, is thus
disciples

created from a group of words that do not represent a unified meaning in St
Paul's text; but taken in itself, this group of words has a meaning for
Augustine, and he explains it in the context of De vera religione where he uses
it: the inner man, that is, the human spirit, discovers that what permits him
to think and reason is the truth, that is, d ivine reason - that is, for Augustine,
Christ, who dwells in, who is present within, the human spirit. In this way
the formula takes on a Platonic meaning. We see how, from St Paul to
Husserl, by way of Augustine, a group of words whose unity was originally
o nly purely material, or which was a misunderstanding of the Latin translator,

was given a new meaning by A ugustine, and then by Husserl, thus taking its
place in the vast tradition of the deepening of the idea of self-consciousness.
This example borrowed from Husserl allows us to touch on the importance
of what in Western thought is called the topos. Literary theories use the term
to refer to the formulae, images, and metaphors that

Our Western thought has been nourished in this way and still lives off a
relatively limited number of formulae and metaphors borrowed from the
various traditions of which it is the result. For example, there are maxims that
encourage a certain inner attitude such as "Know thyself'; those which have
long guided our view of nature: "Nature makes no leaps," "Nature delights
in diversity . " There are metaphors such as "The force of truth," "The world
as a book" ( which is perhaps extended in the conception of the genetic code
as a text). There are biblical formulae such as "I am who I am," which have
profoundly marked the idea of God . The point I strongly wish to emphasize
here is the following: these prefabricated models, of which I have j ust given
some examples, were known during the Renaissance and in the modern world
in the very form that they had in the Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and
they were originally understood during the Renaissance and in the modern
world with the very meaning these models of thought had d uring the
Greco-Roman period, especially at the end of antiquity. So these models
continue to explain many aspects of our contemporary thought and even the
very significance, sometimes unexpected, that we find in antiquity. For
example, the classical prej ud ice, which has done so much damage to the study
of late Greek and Latin literatures, is an invention of the Greco-Roman
period, which created the model of a canon of classical authors as a reaction
against mannerism and the baroque, which, at that time, were called
"Asianism . " But if the classical prej udice already existed during the Hellen­
istic and especially imperial eras, this is precisely because the distance we feel
with respect to classical Greece also appeared at that time. It is precisely this
Hellenistic spirit, this d istance, in some ways modern, through which, for
example, the traditional myths become the objects of scholarship or of
philosophical and moral interpretations . It is through Hellenistic and Roman
thought, particularly that of late antiquity, that the Renaissance was to
perceive Greek tradition . This fact was to be of decisive importance for the
birth of modern European thought and art. In another respect contemporary
hermeneutic theories that, proclaiming the autonomy of the written text, have
constructed a veritable tower of Babel of interpretations where all meanings
become possible, come straight out of the practices of ancient exegesis, about
which I spoke earlier. Another example: for our late colleague Roland Barthes,
"many features of our literature, of our teaching, of our institutions of
language . . . would be elucidated and understood differently if we fu lly knew

. . . the rhetorical code that gave its language to our culture." This is

completely true, and we could add that this knowledge would perhaps enable
us to be conscious of the fact that in their methods and modes of expression
our human sciences often operate in a way comp letely analogous to the

mmlcl11

of ancient rhetoric .

O ur h i 11 1 o ry of Hellenistic a n d Roman thought should therefore not only

be a historical topics that will study the evolution of the meaning of the

topoi,

the models of which we have spoken, and the role they have played in the
formation of Western thought. This historical topics should work hard at
discerning the original meanings of the formulae and models and the different
significances that successive reinterpretations have given them.
At first, this historical topics will take for its object of study those works
that were founding models and the literary genres that they created. Euclid's
Elements, for example, served as a model for Proclus's

Elements of Theology
Ethics. Plato's Timaeus, itself inspired by pre-Socratic
cosmic poems, served as a model for Lucretius' De rerum natura, and the

but also for Spinoza's

eighteenth century, in tum , was to dream of a new cosmic poem that would
exhibit the latest discoveries of science. Augustine's

Confessions, as it was

misinterpreted, moreover, inspired an enormous literature up to Rousseau
and the romantics.
This topics could also be a topics of aphorisms: for example, of the maxims
about nature that dominated the scientific imagination until the nineteenth
century. This year [at the ColJege de France] , we will study in this way the
aphorism of Heraclitus that is usually phrased as "Nature loves to hide
herself," although this is certainly not the original meaning of the three Greek
words so translated. We will examine the significance this formula takes on
throughout antiquity and later on, as a function of the evolution of the idea
of nature, the very interpretation proposed by Martin Heidegger.
Above all, this historical topics will be a topics about the themes of
meditations of which we spoke a few minutes ago, which have dominated and
still dominate our Western thought. Plato, for example, had defined philo­
sophy as an exercise for death, understood as the separation of the soul from
the body. For Epicurus this exercise for death takes on a new meaning; it
becomes the consciousness of the finitude of existence that gives an infinite
value to each instant: "Persuade yourself that every new day that dawns will
be your last one. And then you will receive each unhoped for hour with
gratitude." In the perspective of Stoicism, the exercise for death takes on a
different charac.'ter; it invites immediate conversion and makes inner freedom
possible: "Let death be before your eyes each day and you will not have any
base thoughts or excessive desires." A mosaic at the Roman National Museum
is inspired, perhaps ironically, by this meditation, as it depicts a skeleton with
a scythe accompanied by the inscription
that as

it may,

Gnothi seauton, "Know thyself." Be

Christianity will make abundant use of this theme of meditation.

There it can be treated in a manner close to Stoicism, as in this monk's
reflection: "Since the beginning of our conversation, we have come closer to

be vigilant while we still have the time." But it changes radically
Christian theme of p11rt ici 11ni-ion in
Christ's death. Leaving aside all of the rich Western litemry t r1ulit iun1 No well

death. Let us

when it is combined with the properly

Fonns of Life and Forms of Discourse

69

we can go straight to Heidegger in order to rediscover this fundamental
philosophical exercise in his definition of the authenticity of existence as a
lucid anticipation of death.
Linked to the meditation upon death, the theme of the value of the present
instant plays a fundamental role in all the philosophical schools. In short it is
a consciousness of inner freedom. It can be summarized in a formula of this
kind: you need only yourself in order immediately to find inner peace by
ceasing to worry about the past and the future. You can be happy right now,
or you will never be happy. Stoicism will insist on the effort needed to pay
attention to oneself, the joyous acceptance of the present moment imposed on
us by fate. The Epicurean will conceive of this liberation from cares about the
past and the future as a relaxation, a pure joy of existing: "While we are
speaking, jealous time has flown; seize today without placing your trust in
tomorrow. " This is Horace's famous

laetus in praesens, this "enjoyment of the

pure present," to use Andre Chastel's fine expression about Marsilio Fidno,
who had taken this very formula of Horace's for his motto. Here again the
history of this theme in Western thought is fascinating. I cannot resist the
pleasure of evoking the d ialogue between Faust and Helena, the climax of part
two of Goethe's

Faust: "Nun schaut der Geist nicht vorwarts, nicht zurilck, I

Die Gegenwart allein ist unser Gluck" ["And so the spirit looks neither ahead
nor behind. The present alone is our joy . . . Do not think about your destiny.
Being here is a duty, even though it only be an instant"].
I have come to the end of this inaugural address, which means that I have
j ust completed what in antiquity was called an

epideixis, a set speech. It is in

a direct line with those that professors in the time of Libanius, for example,
had to give in order to recruit an audience while at the same time tryin g to
demonstrate the incomparable worth of their speciality and to display their
eloquence. It would be interesting to investigate the historic paths by which
this ancient practice was transmitted to the first professors at the College de
France. In any case, at this very moment, we are in the process of fully living
a Greco-Roman tradition. Philo of Alexandria said of these sei: speeches that
the lecturer "brought into broad daylight the fruit of long efforts pursued in
private, as painters and sculptors seek, in realizing their works, the applause
of the public." And he opposed this behavior to the true philosophical
instruction i n which the teacher adapts his speech to the state of his listeners
and brings them the cures they need in order to be healed .
The concern with individual destiny and spiritual progress, the intransi­
gent assertion of moral requ irements, the call for meditation, the invitation to
seek this inner peace that all the schools, even those of the skeptics, propose

Rs the a i m of philosophy, the feeling for the seriousness and grandeur

consciousness we should have of human suffering and misery, and they will
think that the philosopher thereby shows himself to be irremediably foreign
to the world. I would answer simply by quoting this beautiful text by Georges
Friedmann, from 1 942, which offers a glimpse of the possibility of reconciling
the concern for justice and spiritual effort; it could have been written by a
Stoic of antiquity:
Take flight each day! At least for a moment, however brief, as long as
it is intense. Every day a "spiritual exercise," alone or in the company
of a man who also wishes to better himself. . . . Leave ordinary time
behind. Make an effort to rid yourself of your own passions . . . . Become
eternal by surpassing yourself. This inner effort is necessary, this
ambition, j ust. Many are those who are entirely absorbed in militant
politics, in the preparation for the social revolution. Rare, very rare, are
those who, in order to prepare for the revolution, wish to become
worthy of it.1

Philosophy, Exegesis, and Creative
Mistakes

Everyone is familiar with Whitehead's remark: "Western philosophy is
nothing but a series of footnotes to Plato's dialogues . " This statement could
be interpreted in two ways: we could take it to mean that Plato's problematics
have made a definitive mark upon Western philosophy, and this woul d be
true. Alternatively, it could be taken to mean that, in a concrete sense,
Western philosophy has assumed the form of commentaries - be they on Plato
or on other philosophers - and that, more generally speaking, it has taken the
form of exegesis. This, too, is to a very large extent true. It is important to
realize that, for almost two thousand years - from the mid-fourth century BC
to the end of the sixteenth century AD - philosophy was conceived of, above
all, as the exegesis of a small number of texts deriving from "au thorities,"
chief among whom were Plato and Aristotle. We are, moreover, j ustified in
asking ourselves if, even after the Cartesian revol ution, philosophy does not
still bear traces of its lengthy past, and if, even today, at least to a certain
extent, it has not remained exegesis.
The long period of "exegetical" philosophy is linked to a sociological
phenomenon : the existence of philosophical schools, in which the thought,
life-style, and writings of a master were religiously preserved. This phenome­
non seems already to have existed among the Presocratics, but we are best
able to observe it from Plato on.
Plato had given his Academy an extremely solid material and juridical
organization . The leaders of the school succeeded one another 1 in a continu­

ous chain until Justinian's closure of the school of Athens in 529, and

throu gh ou t this entire period , scholarly activity was carried out according to
fi xed, t rnd itionnl methods. The other great schools, whether Peripatetic,
Stoic, or Epicurean , w e re organized along similar lines. The writings of each

72

Method

in which order the student should read these writings, in order to acquire the
best possible education. We still have some of the writings in which Platonists
gave advice on the order in which Plato's dialogues were to be read . Thus,
we can tell that from the fourth century BC on, Aristotle's logical writings
were arranged in a definite scholastic order - the

Organon

-

which would not

change until modem times.
Instruction consisted above all in commenting on Plato and Aristotle, using
previous commentaries and adding a new interpretation here and there. In
this regard, we have an interesting testi m ony from Porphyry about the lessons
of Plotinus:
During his classes, he used to have the commentaries read, perhaps of
Severus or of Cronius or of N umenius or Gaius or Atticus, or of
Peripatetics like Aspasi us, Alexander, or whichever other came to hand .
Yet he never repeated anything from these commentaries word for
word , restricted himself to these readings alone. Rather, he himself used
to give a general explanation [theoria] of (Plato's or Aristotle's) text in
his own personal way, which was d i fferent from current opinion. In his
investigations, moreover, he brought to bear the spirit of Ammonius.2
The first commentator on Plato's

Timaeus seems to have been Crantor

(ca. 330 BC), and Platonic commentators continued their activity until the
end of the Athenian school in the sixth century. From this point, the tradition
was continued, both in the Arab world and in the Latin West, up until the
Renaissance (Marsilio Ficino). As for Aristotle, he was first commented u pon
by Andron icus of Rhodes (first century BC), who was the first in a series
extending through the end of the Renaissance, in the person of Zabardella. In
addition to comme n taries

slriclo sensu, the exege tical activity of the philosoph­

ical schools took the form of dogmatic treatises, devoted to particular points
of exegesis, and manuals designed to serve as introductions to the study of
the masters. Moreover, the end of antiquity witnessed the appearance of other
authorities, in addition to Plato and Aristotle: the authority of Revelations.
For Christians and Jews, this meant primari l y the Bible, and for pagan
philosophers, the

Chaldaean Oracles. Both Judaism and Christianity sought to

presen t themselves to the Greek world as philosophies; th e y thus de veloped ,

in the persons of Philo and Origen re sp ec ti vely, a biblical exege si s analogous
to the traditional pagan exegesis of Plato. For their part, such pagan
commentators on the Clzaldaean Oracles as Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Proc l u s
did their best to show that the teachings of the "gods" coin cide d with Plato's
doctrines. If we understand by "theology" the rational exegesis of n

sacred

text, then we can say that duri n g this period p h i losop h y was t rim11formed in to
theology, and it was to stay that way throughoul l hc M idLl lc Al(cN. From 1 his

ancient exegetical tradition. M.-D. Chenu3 has defined the specific character
of Scholastics as "dialectics applied to the comprehension 9f a text: either a

continuous text, in which case the goal is the writing of a commentary, or of
a series of texts, which are selected to serve as bases and proofs for a given
speculative construction. " 4 For this scholar, Scholastics is "a rational form of
thought which is consciously and deliberately elaborated, taking as its
starting-point a text considered as authoritative." 5 If we accent these defini­
tions, we can assert that Scholastic thought did nothing other than adopt
thought-processes already traditionally used in the majority of ancient philo­
sophical schools. Conversely, we could also say that these schools were already
engaging in Scholastic thought. Throughout the Middle Ages, instruction
consisted essentially in textual commentary, whether of the Bible, Aristotle,
Boethius, or the Sentences of Peter Lombard .
These facts have important consequences for the general interpretation of
the history of philosophy, especially d uring its pre-Cartesian period. Insofar
as philosophy was considered exegesis, the search for truth, throughout this
period, was confounded with the search for the meaning of "authentic" texts;
that is, of those texts considered as authoritative. Truth was contained within
these text.�; it was the property of their authors, as it was also the property of
those groups who recognized the authority of these authors, and who were
consequently the "heirs" of this original truth.
Philosophical problems were expressed in exegetical terms. For example, we
find Plotinus writing the following in the course of his investigation of the
problem of evil : "We must try to find out in what sense Plato says that evils shall
not pass away, and that their existence is necessary." 6 Typically, the rest of
Plotinus' inquiry consists in a discussion of the terminology used by Plato in his
Theaelelus.7 The famous battle over universals, which divided the Middle Ages,

was based on the exegesis of a single phrase from Porphyry's

lsagoge. It would

be possible to make a list of all the texts which, upon being discussed, formed
the basis of all ancient and medieval problematics. The list would not be long: it
might contain a few passages from Plato (especially the

Ti111aeus),

Boethius, the first chapter of Genesis, and the prologue to the

Aristotle,

Gospel ofJohn.

The fact that authentic texts raise questions is not due to any i nherent
defect. On the contrary: their obscurity, it was thought, was only the result
of a technique used by a master, who wished to hint at a great many things
at once, and therefore enclosed the "truth" in his formulations. Any potential
m�aning, as long as it was coherent with what was considered to be the
master's doctrine, was consequently held to be true. Charles Thurot's remark8
nbout the commentators on the grammarian Priscianus is applicable to all the
ph ilo s op h er cxegctcs:

supposed to be contained in it. What they termed an "authentic" author
could neither be m istaken, nor contradict himself, nor develop his
arguments poorly, nor disagree with any other authentic author. The
most forced exegesis was used in order to accommodate the letter of the
text to what was considered the truth.9

It was believed that the truth had been "given" in the master's texts, and that
all that had to be done was to bring it to light and explicate it. Plotinus, for
example, writes: "These statements arc not new; they do not belong to the
present time, but were made long ago, although not explicitly, and what we
have said in this discussion has been an interpretation of them, relying on
Plato's own writings for evidence that these views arc ancient. " 1 0 Here we
encounter another aspect of the conception of truth implied by "exegetical"
philosophy. Each philosophical or religious school or group believed itself to
be in possession of a traditional truth, communicated from the beginning by
the divinity to a few wise men . Each therefore laid claim to being the
legitimate depositary of the truth.
From this perspective, the conflict between pagans and Christians, from the
second century AD on, is highly instructive. As both pagans and Christians
recognized affinities between their respective doctrines, they accused each
other of theft. Some claimed Plato plagiarized Moses, while others affirmed
the contrary; the result was a series of chronological arguments destined to
prove which of the two was historically prior. For Clement of Alexandria, the
theft dated back even before the creation of humanity. It had been some
wicked angel who, having d iscovered some traces of the divine truth , revealed
philosophy to the wise of this world. 1 1
Pagans and Christians explained in the same way the differences which ,
despite certain analogies, persisted between their doctrines. They were the
result of misunderstandings and m istranslations - in other words, bad exegesis
- of stolen texts. For Celsus, the Christian conception of humility was nothing
but a poor interpretation of a passage in Plato's

Laws;12 the idea of the

k ingdom of God only a misreading of a passage in Plato's text on the king of
all things, l l and the notion of the resurrection only a misunderstanding of the
i dea of transmigration . On the Christian side, Justin asserted that some of
Plato's statements showed that he had misunderstood the text of Moses.1�
In this intellectual atmosphere, error was the result of bad exegesis,
m istranslation, and fa ulty understanding. Nowadays, however, historians
seem to consider all exegetical thought as the result of mistakes or misunder­
standings. We can briefly enumerate the forms these alleged mistakes and
deformations are thought to assume: in the first place, the excgctes make
arbitrary systematizations. For instance, they take out of con t e x t passages
originally widely se p a ra t e d from ea ch other, nml n n11l yze t hl'rn in 11 p U l'ely
formal way, in order t o red uce t he texts to hl' cx pl11 i nl'll t o 11 hoi l \' 1 11' rnhl'rl' n t

75

Philosophy, Exegesis, and Crtalivt Mistakes

doctrine. In this way, for instance, a four- o r five-tiered hierarchy of being
was extracted from various dialogues of Plato.
Nor is this the most serious abuse. Whether consciously or not, systemat­
ization amalgamates the most disparate notions, which had originated in
different or even contradictory doctrines. Thus we find the commentators on
Aristotle using Stoic and Platonic ideas in their exegesis of Aristotelian texts.
It is fairly frequent, especially in the case of translated texts, to find
commentators trying to explain notions which simply do not exist in the
original. In

Psalm 1 1 3 : 1 6, for example, we read : "The heaven is the heaven

of the Lord. " Augustine, however, started out from the Greek translation of
the Bible, and understood : "The heaven of heavens is of [i.e. belongs to] the
Lord . " A ugustine is thus led to imagine a cosmological reality, which he

identifies with the intelligible world, which he then goes on to try and locate
with relation to the "heaven" mentioned in the first verse of

Genesis. From

the point of view of the actual text of the Bible, this whole construction is
based on thin air.
Cases of misunderstanding arc not always this extreme. Nevertheless, it
frequently occurs that exegeses construct entire edifices of interpretation on
the basis of a banal or misunderstood phrase. The whole of Neoplatonic
exegesis of the

Parmenides seems to be an example of such a phenomenon.

The modern historian may be somewhat disconcerted on coming across
such modes of thought, so far removed from his usual manner of reasoning.
He is, however, forced to admit one fact: very often, mistakes and misunder­
standings have brought about important evolutions in the history of philo­
sophy. In particular, they have caused new ideas to appear. The most
interesting example of this seems to me to be the appearance of the distinction
between "being" as an infinitive and "being" as a participle, 1 5 which, as I have
shown elsewhere, 16 was thought up by Porphyry in order to solve a problem
posed by a passage in Plato. In the Parmenides, 17 Plato had asked: "If the One

is, is it possible that it should not participate in being [ousia]?" For the
Neoplatonist Porphyry, the One in question here is the second One. If this
second One participates in

ousia, he reasons, we must assume that ousia is

prior to the second One. Now, the only thing prior to the second One is the
first One, and this latter is not in any sense

ousia. Thus, Porphyry concludes
ousia designates the first One in an enigmatic,
symbolical way . The first One is not ousia in the sense of "substance"; rather,
it \s being (elre) in the sense of a pure, transcendent act, prior to being as a
that, in this passage, the word

substan tial

object (etanl). L 'etant,

then, is the first substance and the first

determination of l 'etre.
The history of the notion of being is, moreover, marked by a whole series
of s u c h crea tive mistakes. If we consider the series formed by

idea of ousia or essence is amongst the most confused and confusing of
notions. I have tried to show elsewhere18 that the distinction, established by
Boethius, between

esse

and

quod est19

did not originally have the meaning that

the Middle Ages was later to attribute to it.
It is clear that historians of philosoph y must use the greatest caution in
applying the idea of "system" for the comprehension of the philosophical
works of antiquity and the Middle Ages. It is not the case that every properly
philosophical endeavor is "systematic" in the Kantian or Hegelian sense. For
two thousand years, philosophical thought utilized a methodology which
condemned it to accept incoherences and far-fetched associations, precisely to
the extent that it wanted to be systematic. But to study the actual progress of
exegetical thought is to begin to realize that thought can function rationally
in many different ways, which are not necessarily the same as those of
mathematical logic or Hegelian dialectic.
Philosophers of the modem era, from the seventeenth to the beginning of the
nineteenth centuries, refused the argument from authority and abandoned the
exegetical mode of thinking. They began to consider that the truth was not a
ready-made gi ven , but was rather the result of a process of elaboration, carried
out by a reason grounded in itself. After an initial period of optimism, however,
in which people believed it was possible for thought to postula te

itself in

an

absolute way, philosophy began to become more and more aware, from the
nineteenth century on, of its historical and especially linguistic conditioning.
This was a legitimate reaction, but it could be that it<t result has been that
philosophers have let themselves be hypnotized by philosophical discourse
taken in and for itself. In the last analysis, p h i l osop hic al discourse now tends
to have as its object nothing but more philosophical discourse. In a sense,

contemporary philosophical discourse has once again become exegetical, and ,
sad t o say, it often interprets its texts with the same violence used b y ancient
practitioners of allegory.

Spiritual Exercises

To take flight every day! At least for a moment, which may be brief, as
long as it is intense. A "spiritual exercise" every day - either alone, or
in the company of someone

who also wishes to better himself. Spiritual

exercises. Step out of duration . . . try to get rid of your own passions,
vanities, and the itch for talk about your own name, which sometimes
burns you like a chronic disease. A void backbiting. Get rid of pity and
hatred . Love all free human beings. Become eternal by transcending
yourself.
This work on yourself is necessa ry; this ambition justified. Lots of people
let

themselves be wholly absorbed by militant politics and the preparation

for social revolution. Rare, much more rare, are they who, in order to
prepare for the revolution, are willing to make themselves worthy of it.
With the exception of the last few lines, doesn't this text look like a pastiche
of Marcus Aurelius? It is by Georges Friedmann, 1 and it is quite possible that,
when he wrote it, the author was not aware of the resemblance. Moreover, in

himself '',2 he
to the conclusion th a t there is no tradition - be it Jewish, Christian, or

the rest of his book, in which he seeks a place "to re-source
comes

Oriental - compatible with contemporary spiritual demands. Curiously,
however, he does not ask himself about the value of the philosophical tradition
of Greco-Roman antiquity, a lth o u gh the lines we have j ust quoted show to
just what extent ancient tradition continues - albeit unconsciously - to live
within him, as it does

within each of us.

".Spiri tual exercises. " The expression is a bit d isconcerting for the contem­
porary reader. In the first place, it is no longer quite fashionable these days

to use the word " s p i ritu al . " I t is nevertheless necessary to use this term, I
believe, because none of t he other adjectives we could use - "psychic,"
"moral," "ethical," "intellectual," "of thought," "of the soul'' - covers all the

modify itself, it would be possible for us to speak in terms of "thought
exercises." Yet the word "thought" does not indicate clearly enough that
imagination and sensibility play a very important role in these exercises. For
the same reason, we cannot be satisfied with "intellectual exercises," although
such intellectual factors as definition, division, ratiocination, reading, invest­
igation, and rhetorical amplification play a large role in them. "Ethical
exercises" is a rather tempting expression, since, as we shall see, the exercises
in question contribute in a powerful way to the therapeutics of the passions,
and have to do with the conduct of life. Yet, here again, this would be too
limited a view of things. As we can glimpse through Friedmann's text, these
exercises in fact correspond to a transformation of our vision of the world,
and to a metamorphosis of our personality. The word "spiritual" is quite apt
to make us understand that these exercises are the result, not merely of
thought, but of the individual's entire psychism. Above all, the word
"spiritual" reveals the true dimensions of these exercises. By means of them,
the individual raises himself up to the life of the objective Spirit; that is to
say, he re-places himself within the perspective of the Whole ("Become
eternal by transcending yourself").
Here our reader may say, "All right, we'll accept the expression 'spiritual
exercises'. But are we talking about Ignatius of Loyola's Exercitia spiritualia?4
What relationship is there between lgnatian meditations and Friedmann's
program of "stepping out of duration . . . becoming eternal by transcending
oneself?" Our reply, quite simply, is that Ignatius' Exercil ia spiritualia arc
nothing but a Christian version of a Greco-Roman tradition, the extent of which
we hope to demonstrate in what follows. In the first place, both the idea and the
terminology of e�:erdtium spirituale arc attested in early Latin Christianity, well
before Ignatius of Loyola, and they correspond to the Greek Christian term
askesis.5 In tum, askesis - which must be understood not as asceticism, but as the
practice of spiritual exercises - already existed within the philosophical tradition
of antiquity.6 In the final analysis, it is to antiquity that we must return in order
to explain the origin and significance of this idea of spiritual exercises, which, as
Friedmann's example shows, is still alive in contemporary consciousness.
The goal of the present chapter is not merely to draw attention to the
existence of spiritual exercises in Greco-Latin antiquity, but above all to
delimit the scope and importance of the phenomenon, and to show the
consequences which it entails for the understanding not only of ancient
thought, but of philosophy itself.7

that philosophy, for them, was an "exercise!' 8 In their view, philosophy did
not consist in teaching an abstract theory9 - much less in the e,xegesis of texts10
- but rather in the art of living. 1 1 It is a concrete attitude and determinate life­
style, which engages the whole of existence. The philosoph ical act is not
situated merely on the cognitive level, but on that of the self and of being. I t
is a progress which causes us t o

be more fully, and makes u s better. 1 2 It is a

conversion13 which turns our entire life upside down, changing the life of the
person who goes through it. 14 It raises the individual from an inauthentic
condition of life, darkened by unconsciousness and harassed by worry, to an
authentic state of life, in which he attains self-consciousness, an exact vision
of the world, inner peace, and freedom.
In the view of all philosophical schools, mankind's principal cause of
suffering, disorder, and unconsciousness were the passions: that is, unregu­
lated desires and exaggerated fears. People are prevented from truly living, i t
was taught, because they are dominated by worries. Philosophy thus appears,
in the first place, as a therapeutic of the passions1 5 (in the words of
Friedmann: "Try to get rid of your own passions"). Each school had its own
therapeutic method, 16 but all of them linked their therapeutics to a profound
transformation of the individual's mode of seeing and being. The object of
spiritual exercises is precisely to bring about this transformation.
To begin with, let us consider the example of the Stoics. For them, all
mankind's woes derive from the fact that he seeks to acquire or to keep
possessions that he may either lose or fail to obtain, and from the fact that he
tries to avoid misfortunes which are often inevitable. The task of philosophy,
then, is to educate people, so that they seek only the goods they are able to
obtain, and try to avoid only those evils which it is possible to avoid. In order
for something good to be always obtainable, or an evil always avoidable, they
must depend exclusively on man's freedom; but the only things which fulfill
these conditions are moral good and evil. They alone depend on us;
everything else does not depend on us. Here, "everything else," which does
not depend on us, refers to the necessary linkage of cause and effect, which
is not subject to our freedom. It must be indifferent to us: that is, we must
not i ntroduce any differences into it, but accept it in its entirety, as willed by
fate. This is the domain of nature.
We have here a complete reversal of our usual way of looking at things. We
are to switch from our "human•• vision of reality, in which our values depend
on our passions, to a "natural" vision of things, which replaces each event
,
within the perspective of universal nature . 1 7
Such a transformation of vision is not easy, and it i s precisely here that
s pi r i t u al exercises come in. Little by little, they make possible the indispens­
able metamorphosis of our inner self.

Spiritual Exercises

other of such inner activities are very frequent in the writings of the Roman
and Hellenistic periods. It thus appears that these exercises were well known,
and that it was enough to allude to them, since they were a part of daily life
in the philosophical schools. They took their place within a traditional course
of oral instruction.
Thanks to Philo of Alexandria, however, we do possess two lists of spiritual
exercises. They do not completely overlap, but they do have the merit of
giving us a fairly complete panorama of Stoico-Platonic inspired philosophical
therapeutics. One of these lists 1 9 enumerates the following elements: research
(zetesis), thorough investigation (skepsis), reading (anagnosis), listening (ak­
roasis), attention (prosoche), self-mastery (enkrateia), and indifference to indif­
ferent things. The other20 names successively: reading, meditations (meleta1),
therapies2 1 of the passions, remembrance of good things,22 self-mastery
(enkrateia), and the accomplishment of duties. With the help of these lists, we
shall be able to give a brief description of Stoic spiritual exercises. We shall
study the following groups in succession: first attention, then meditations
and "remembrances of good things," then the more intellectual exercises:
reading, listening, research, and investigation, and finally the more active
exercises: self-mastery, accomplishment of duties, and indifference to indif­
ferent things.
Attention ( prosoche) is the fundamental Stoic spiritual attitude.23 It is a
continuous vigilance and presence of mind, self consciousness which never
sleeps, and a constant tension of the spirit.2• Thanks to this attitude, the
philosopher is fully aware of what he does at each instant, and he wills his
actions fully. Thanks to his spiritual vigilance, the Stoic always has "at hand"
( procheiron) the fundamental rule of life: that is, the distinction between what
depends on us and what does not. As in Epicureanism, so for Stoicism: it is
essential that the adepts be supplied with a fundamental principle which is
formulable in a few words, and extremely clear and simple, precisely so that it
may remain easily accessible to the mind, and be applicable with the sureness
and constancy of a reflex. "You must not separate yourself from these general
principles; don't sleep, eat, drink, or converse with other men without them." 25
It is this vigilance of the spirit which lets us apply the fundamental rule to each
of life's particular situations, and always to do what we do "appropriately." 26
We could also define this attitude as "concentration on the present moment": n
Everywhere and at all times, it is up to you to rejoice piously at what is
occu rring at the present moment, to conduct yourself with justice towards the
people who are present here and now, and to apply rul� of discernment to your
present representations, so that nothing slips in that is not objective.211

future29 - two areas which do not depend on us. By encouraging concentration
on the minuscule present moment, which, in its exiguity, is always bearable
and controllable,30 attention increases our vigilance. Finally, ' attention to the
present moment allows us to accede to cosmic consciousness, by making us
attentive to the infinite value of each instant,31 and causing us to accept each
moment of existence from the viewpoint of the universal law of the cosmos.
Attention ( prosoche) allows us to respond immediately to events, as if they
were questions asked of us all of a sudden. 32 In order for this to be possible,
we must always have the fundamental principles "at hand" ( procheiron).33 We
are to steep ourselves in the rule of life (kanon),34 by mentally applying it to
all life's possible different situations, just as we assimilate a grammatical or
mathematical rule through practice, by applying it to individual cases. In this
case, however, we are not dealing with mere knowledge, but with the
transformation of our personality.
We must also associate our imagination and affectivity with the training of
our thought. Here, we must bring into play all the psychagogic techniques
and rhetorical methods of amplification.35 We must formulate the rule of life
to ourselves in the most striking and concrete way. We must keep life's events
"b e fore our eyes, " 36 an d see them in th e light o f the fund amenta l rule. This
is known as the exercise of memorization (mneme)31 and meditation (me/ete)38
on the rule of life.
The exercise of meditation39 allows us to be ready at the moment when an
unexpected - and perhaps dramatic - circumstance occurs. In the exercise
called praemeditatio malorum,40 we are to represent to ourselves poverty,
suffering, and death. We must confront life's difficulties face to face,
remembering that they are not evils, since they do not depend on us. This is
why we must engrave striking maxims in our memory,41 so that, when the
time comes, they can help us accept such events, which are, after all, part of
the course of nature; we will thus have these maxims and sentences "at
hand . " 42 What we need are persuasive formulae or arguments (epilogismoi),4l
which we can repeat to ourselves in difficult circumstances, so as to check
movements of fear, anger, or sadness.
First thing in the morning, we should go over in advance what we have to
do during the course of the day, and decide on the principles which will guide
and inspire our actions.44 In the evening, we should examine ourselves again,
so as to be aware of the faults we have committed or the progress we have
m a d e 45 We should also examine our dreams.46
A s we can see, the exercise of meditation is an attempt to control inner
discourse, in an effort to render it coherent. The goal is to arrange it around
o simple, universal principle: the distinction between what does and does not
depend on us, or between freedom and nature. Whoever wishes to make

at a complete transformation of his representation of the world, his inner
climate, and his outer behavior. These methods testify to a deep knowledge

of the therapeutic powers of the world . s i
The exercise of meditation and memorization requires nourishment. This
is where the more specifically intellectual exercises, as enumerated by Philo,

come in: reading, listening, research, and investigation. It is a relatively simple
matter to provide food for meditation: one could read the sayings of the poets
and philosophers, for instance, or the

apoph1hegmata.s2 "Reading," however,

could also include the explanation of specifically philosophical texts, works
written by teachers in philosophical schools. Such texts could be read or heard
within the framework of the philosophical instruction given by a professor.s3
Fortified by such instruction, the disciple would be able to study with
precision the entire speculative edifice which sustained and justified the
fundamental rule, as well as all the physical and logical research of which this
rule was the summary. s4 "Research" and "investigation " were the result of
putting instruction into practice. For example, we are to get used to defining
objects and events from a physical point of view, that is, we must picture
them as they are when situated within the cosmic Whole.ss Alternatively, we
can divide or dissect events in order to recognize the elements into which
they can be reduced . 56
Finally, w e come t o t h e practical exercises, intended to create habits. Some
of these are very much "interior," and very close to the thought exercises we
have j ust discussed. "Indifference to indifferent things," for example, was
nothing other than the application of the fundamental rule. s7 Other exercises,
such as self-mastery and fulfilling the duties of social life, entailed practical
forms of behavior. Here again, we encounter Friedmann's themes: "Try to get
rid of your own passions, vanities, and the itch for talk about your own name
. . . Avoid backbiting. Get rid of pity and hatred . Love all free human beings."
There are a large number of treatises relating to these exercises in Plutarch :

On Restraining Anger, On Peace of M i nd, On Brotherly Love, On the Love of
Children, On Garruli{y, On the Love of Wealth, On False Shame, On Envy and
Haired. Seneca also composed works of the same genre: On Anger, On
Benefits, On Peace of Mind, On L e isure In this kind of exercise, one very
.

simple principle is always recommended: begin practicing on easier things, so
as gradually to acquire a stable, solid habit. 58
For the Stoic, then , doing philosophy meant practicing how to "live": that
is, how to live freely and consciously. Consciously, in that we pass beyond the
limits of individuality, to recognize ourselves as a part of the reason-animated

cosmos. Freely, in that we give up desiring that which does not depend on us
and is beyond our control, so as to attach ourselves only to what depends on
us: actions which are just and in con formity with reason.
It is easy to understand that a ph ilo so phy l i ke Stoicism, which re<1 uircs

exercises. But it will perhaps come as a surprise to learn than Epicureanism,
usually considered the philosophy of pleasure, gives just as pr,ominent a place
as Stoicism to precise practices which are nothing other than spiritual
exercises. The reason for this is that, for Epicurus just as much as for the
Stoics, philosophy is a therapeutics: "We must concern ourselves with the
healing of our own lives." 59 In this context, healing consists in bringing one's
soul back from the worries of life to the simple joy of existing. People's
unhappiness, for the Epicureans, comes from the fact that they are afraid of
things which are not to be feared, and desire things which it is not necessary
to desire, and which are beyond their control. Consequently, their life is
consumed in worries over unjustified fears and unsatisfied desires. As a result,
they are deprived of the only genuine plea.i;ure there is: the pleasure of
existing. This is why Epicurean physics can liberate us from fear: it can show
us that the gods have no effect on the progress of the world and that death,
being complete dissolution, is not a part of life.60 Epicurean ethics: Epicurean,
as deliverance from desires can deliver us from our insatiable desires, by
distinguishing between desires which are both natural and necessary, desires
which are natural but not necessary, and desires which are neither natural nor
necessary. It is enough to satis fy the first category of desires, and give up the
last and eventually the second as well - in order to ensure the absence of
worries,61 and to reveal the sheer joy of existing: "The cries of the flesh are:
'Not to be hungry', 'not to be thirsty', 'not to be cold'. For if one enjoys the
possession of this, and the hope of continuing to possess it, he might rival
even Zeus in happiness." 62 This is the source of the feeling of gratitude,
which one would hardly have expected, which illuminates what one might call
Epicurean piety towards all things: "Thanks be to blessed Nature, that she
has made what is necessary easy to obtain, and what is not easy unnecess­
ary." 6J
Spiritual exercises are required for the healing of the soul. Like the Stoics,
the Epicureans advise us to meditate upon and assimilate, "day and night,"
brief aphorisms or summaries which will allow us to keep the fundamental
dogmas "at hand. " 64 .For instance, there is the well-known tetrapharmakos, or
four-fold healing formula: "God presents no fears, death no worries. And
w hile good is readily attainable, evil is readily endurable. " 65 The abundance
of collections of Epicurean aphorisms is a response to the demands of the
spiritual exercise of meditation.66 As with the Stoics, however, the study of
the dogmatic treatises of the school's great founders was also an exercise
inte n ded to provide material for meditation,67 so as more thoroughly to
impregnate the soul with the fundamental intuitions of Epicureanism.
The study of physics is a particularly important spiritual exercise: "we
i;hould not think t h a t any other end is served by knowledge of celestial

imagination of the i nfinite are important elements of Epicurean physics. Both
can bring about a complete change in our way of looking at things. The closed
universe is infinitely dilated, and we derive from this spectacle a unique
spiritual pleasure :
the walls of the world open out,

I see action going on throughout the

whole void, . . . Thereupon from all these things a sort of divine delight
gets hold upon me and a shuddering, because nature thus by your power
(i.e. Epicurus') has been so manifestly laid open and unveiled in every
part.69
Meditation, however, be it simple or erudite, is not the only Epicurean
spiritual exercise. To cure the soul, it is not necessary, as the Stoics would
have it, to train it to stretch itself tight, but rather to train it to relax. Instead
of picturing misfortunes in advance, so as to be prepared to bear them , we
must rather, say th e E p i cureans, detac h our t h ought from the vision of painful
things, and fix our eyes on pleasurable ones. We arc to relive memories of
past pleasures, and enjoy the pleasures of the present, recognizing how intense
and agreeable these present pleasures are.70 We have here a quite distinctive
spiritual exercise, different from the constant vigilance of the Stoic, with his
constant readiness to safeguard his moral liberty at each instant. Instead,
Epicureanism preaches the deliberate, continually renewed choice of relax­
ation and serenity, combined with a profound gratitude71 toward nature and
life,72 which constantly offer us joy and pleasure, if only we know how to find
them.
By the same token , the spiritual exercise of trying to l ive in the present
moment is very different for Stoics and Epicureans. For the former, it means
mental tension and constant wakefulness of the moral conscience; for the
latter, it is, as we have seen, an invitation to relaxation and serenity. Worry,
which tears us in the direction of the fu ture, hides from us the incomparable
value of the simple fact of existing: "We are born once, and cannot be born
twice, but for all time must be no more. But you , who are not master of
tomorrow, postpone your happiness: life is wasted in procrastination and each
one of us dies overwhelmed with cares. " 7J This is the doctrine contained in
Horace's famous saying:

carpe diem.

Life ebbs as I speak:

so seize each day, and grant the next no credit.74
For the Epicureans, in the last analysis, pleasure is a spi ritual exercise.

Not

pleasure in the form of mere sensual gratification, but the in tellect ual 1>le11su rc

also had its spiritual exercises, carried out in a joyous, relaxed atmosphere.
These include the public confession of one's faults;76 m)itual correction,
carried out in a fraternal spirit; and examining one's conscience.n Above all,
friendship itself was, as it were, the spiritual exercise

par excellence:

"Each

person was to tend towards creating the atmosphere in which hearts could
flourish. The main goal was to be happy, and mutual affection and the
confidence with which they relied upon each other contributed more than
anything else to this happiness . " 78

Learning to Dialogue

The practice of spiritual exercises is likely to be rooted in traditions going
back to immemorial timcs.79 I t is, however, the figure of Socrates that causes
them to emerge into Western consciousness, for this figure was, and has

remained, the living cal l to awaken our moral consciousness.80 We ought not
to forget that this call sounded forth within a specific form : that of dialogue.

In the "Socratic" HI dialogue, the question truly at stake is not what is being
talked about, but

who

is doing the talking.

anyone who is close to Socrates and enters into conversation with him
is l iable to be d rawn into an argument, and whatever subject he may
start, he will be continually carried round and round by him, until at
last he finds that he has to give an account both of his present and past

life,

and when he is once entangled, Socrates will not let him go until

he has completely and thoroughly sifted him . . . And I think there is no
harm in being reminded of any wrong thing which we are, or have been,
doing; he who does not run away from criticism will be sure to take
more heed of his afterlife.82
In a "Socratic" dialog ue, Socrates' interlocutor docs not learn anything, and
Socrates has no inten tion of teaching him anything. He repeats, moreover, to
all who are willing to listen , that the only thing he knows is that he docs not
know anything.HJ Y ct, l ike an indefatigable horsefly,IH Socrates harassed his
interlocutors with questions which put

themselves

into question, forcing them

to pay attention to and take care of themselves.85
My very good friend , you are an Athenian, and belong to a city which
is the greatest and most famous in the world for i ts wisdom and

Socrates' mission consisted in inviting his contemporaries to examine their
conscience, and to take care for their inner progress:
I did not care for the things that most people care about - making
money, having a comfortable home, high military or civil rank, and all
the other activities, political appointments, secret societies, party organ­
izations, which go on in our city

.

.

.

I set myself to do you - each one

of you, individually and in private - what I hold to be the greatest
possible service. I tried to persuade each one of you to

less with what lie has than with what he is,

concern himself

so as to render himself as

excellent and as rational as possible.87
In Plato's

Symposium,

Alcibiades describes the effect made on him by

dialogues with Socrates in the following terms: "this latter-day Marsyas, here,
has often left me in such a state of mind that I've felt I simply couldn't go
on living the way I did . . . He makes me admit that while I'm spending my
time on politics,
myself. " 88

I am neglecting all the things that are crying for attention in

Thus, the Socratic dialogue turns out to be a kind of communal spiritual
exercise. In it, the interlocutors are invited 89 to participate in such inner
spiritual exercises as examination of conscience and attention to oneself; in
other words, they are urged to comply with the famous dictum, "Know
thyself." Although it is difficult to be sure of the original meaning of this
formula, this much is clear: it invites us to establish a relationship of the self
to the self, which constitutes the foundation of every spiritual exercise. To
know oneself means, among other things, to know oneself qua non-sage: that
is, not as a

sophos,

but as a

philo-sophos,

someone

on the way toward wisdom .

Alternatively, it can mean to know oneself in one's essential being; this entails
separating that which we

are not

from that which we

are.

Finally, it can mean

to know oneself in one's true moral state: that is, to examine one's con­
science.90
If we can trust the portrait sketched by Plato and Aristophanes, Socrates,
master of dialogue with others, was also a master of dialogue with himself,
and, therefore, a master of the practice of spiritual exercises. He is portrayed
as capable of extraordinary mental concentration. He arrives late at Agathon's
banquet, for example, because "as we went along the road, Socrates directed
his intellect towards himself, and began to fall beh i n d . " 91 Alcibiades tells the
story of how, during the expedition against Poteidaia, Socrates remained
sta nding all day and all night, "lost in thought." 92 In his Cloutls, Aristophanes
seems to allude to these same Socratic habits:
Now, think hard and cogitate; s11in round i n every way llH you
concen trate. I f you come up Rl(llini;t an inHol uhlc: ll11i n 1 , j u m 1' to a nother

. . . Now don't keep your mind always spinning around itself, but let
your thoughts out into the air a bit, like a may-beetle tie9 by its foot.93
Meditation - the practice of d ialogue with oneself - seems to have held a
place of honor among Socrates' disciples. When Antisthenes was asked what
profit he had derived from philosophy, he replied: "The ability to converse
with myself. " 94 The intimate connection between dialogue with others and
dialogue with oneself is profoundly significant. Only he who is capable of a
genuine encounter with the other is capable of an authentic encounter with
himself, and the converse is equally true. Dialogue can be genuine only within
the framework of presence to others and to oneself. From this perspective,
every spiritual exercise is a dialogue, insofar as it is an exercise of authentic
presence, to oneself and to others. 95
The borderline between "Socratic" and "Platonic" dialogue is im­
possible to delimit. Yet the Platonic dialogue is always "Socratic" in inspira­
tion, because it is an intellectual, and, in the last analysis, a
"spiritual" exercise. This characteristic of the Platonic dialogue needs to be
emphasized.
Platonic dialogues are model exercises. They are models, in that they are
not transcriptions of real dialogues, but literary compositions which present
an ideal dialogue. And they are exercises precisely insofar as they are
dialogues: we have already seen, apropos of Socrates, the dialectical character
of all spiritual exercises. A dialogue is an itinerary of the thought, whose route
is traced by the constantly maintained accord between questioner and
respondent. In opposing his method to that of eristics, Plato strongly
emphasizes this point:
When two friends, like you and I, feel like talking, we have to go about
it in a gentler and more dialectical way. "More dialectical," it seems to
me, means that we must not merely give true responses, but that we
must base our replies only on that which our interlocutor admits that
he himself knows.96
The dimension of the interlocutor is, as we can sec, of capital importance. It
is what prevents the dialogue from becoming a theoretical, dogmatic expose,
and forces it to be a concrete, practical exercise. For the point is not to set
fm:th a doctrine, but rather to guide the interlocutor towards a determinate
mental attitude. It is a combat, amicable but real.
The point is worth stressing, for the same thing happens in every spiritual
exercise: we must let ourselves be changed, in our point of view, attitudes,
11 n<l c o n v i ct io n s This means that we must dialogue with ourselves, and hence
wr tnllHI du baulc with ourselves. This is why, from this perspective, the
mct hmlnlniry of t he Pliuonk di11lol(Ul' is of Much crucial i n te rest:

Spiritual Exercises
Despite what may have been said, Platonic thought bears no resem­
blance to a light-winged dove, who needs no effort to take off from earth
to soar away into the pure spaces of utopia . . . at every moment, the
dove has to fight against the soul of the interlocutor, which is filled with
lead. Each degree of elevation must be fought for and won.97

To emerge victorious from this battle, it is not enough to disclose the truth.
It is not even enough to demonstrate it. What is needed is persuasion, and for
that one must use psychagogy, the art of seducing souls. Even at that, it is
not enough to use only rhetoric, which, as it were, tries to persuade from a
distance, by means of a continuous discourse. What is needed above all is
dialectic, which demands the explicit consent of the interlocutor at every
moment. Dialectic must skillfully choose a tortuous path - or rather, a series
of apparently divergent, but nevertheless convergent, paths98 - in order to
bring the interlocutor to discover the contradictions of his own position, or
to admit an unforeseen conclusion. All th e circles, detours, endless di visions,
digressions, and subtleties which make the modern reader of Plato's Dialogues
so uncomfortable arc destined to make ancient readers and interlocutors travel
a specific path. Thanks to these detours, "with a great deal of effort, one rubs
names, definitions, visions and sensations against one another"; one
"spends a long time in the company of these questions"; one "lives with
them" 'l'I until the light blazes forth. Yet one keeps on practicing, since "for
reasonable people, the measure of listening to such discussions is the whole
of life." 100
What counts is not the solution of a particular problem, but the road
travelled to reach it; a road along which the interlocutor, the disciple, and the
reader form their thought, and make it more apt to discover the truth by
itself: IOI
Stranger: Suppose someone asked us this question about our class of
elementary school-children learning to read. "When a child is asked
what letters spell a word - it can be any word you please - are we to
regard this exercise as undertaken to discover the correct spelling of the
particular word the teacher assigned, or as designed rather to make the
child better able to deal with all words he may be asked to spell?"
Young Socrates: Surely we reply that the purpose is to teach him to
read them all.
Stranger: How docs this principle apply to our present search for the
statesman? Why did we set ourselves the problem? Is our chief purpose
to find the statesman, or have we the larger aim of becoming beucr
dialecticians, more able to tackle all questions?

As we see, the subject-matter of the dialogue counts less than the method
applied in it, and the solution of a problem has less value than the road
travelled in common in order to resolve it. The point is not to find the answer
to a problem before anyone else, but to practice, as effectively as possible, the
application of a method:
ease and speed in reaching the answer to the problem propounded are
most commendable, but the logos requires that this be only a secondary,
not a primary reason for commending an argument. What we must
value first and foremost, above all else, is the philosophical method
itself, and this consists in ability to divide according to forms. If,
therefore, either a lengthy logos or an unusually brief one leaves the
hearer more able to find the forms, it is this presentation of the logos
which must be diligently carried through . 1 03
As a dialectical exercise, th e Platonic dialogue corresponds exactly to a
spiritual exercise. There are two reasons for this. In the first place, discreetly
but genuinely, the dialogue guides the interlocutor - and the reader - towards
conversion. Dialogue is only possible if the interlocutor has a real desire to
dialogue: that is, if he truly wants to discover the truth, desires the Good from
the depths of his soul, and agrees to submit to the rational demands of the
Logos. u>1 His act of faith must correspond to that of Socrates: "It is because
I am convinced of its truth that I am ready, with your help, to inquire into
the nature of virtue. " I O>
In fact, the dialectical effort is an ascent in common towards the truth and
towards the Good, "which every soul pursues."10t• Furthermore, in Plato's
view, every dialectical exercise, precisely because it is an exercise of pure
thought, subject to the demands of the Logos, turns the soul away from the
sensible world, and allows it to convert itself towards the Good. 107 It is the
spirit's itinerary towards the divine.

There is a mysterious connection between language and death. This was
one of the favorite themes of the late Brice Parain, who wrote:

Logos represents a demand for universal rationality, and presupposes a
world of immutable norms, which are opposed to the perpetual state of

Socrates' death was the radical event which founded Platonism. After
all, the essence of Platonism consists in the affirmation that the Good
is the ultimate cause of all beings. In the words of a fourth-century Neo­
platonist:
If all beings are beings only by virtue of goodness, and if they participate
in the Good, then the first must necessarily be a good which transcends
being. Here is an eminent proof of this: souls of value despise being for
the sake of the Good, whenever they voluntarily place themselves in
danger, for their country, their loved ones, or for virtue.109
Socrates exposed himself to death for the sake of virtue. He preferred to die
rather than renounce the demands of his conscience, 1 1 0 thus preferring the
Good above being, and thought and conscience above the life of his body.
This is nothing other than the fundamental philosophical choice. If it is true
that philosophy subjugates the body's will to live to the higher demands of
thought, it can rightly be said that philosophy is the training and apprentice­
ship for death. As Socrates puts it in the Phaedo: "it is a fact, Simmias, that
those who go about philosophizing correctly are in training for death, and that
to them of all men death is least alarming." 1 1 1
The death i n question here i s the spiritual separation o f the soul and the
body:
separating the soul as much as possible from the body, and accustoming
it to gather itself together from every part of the body and concentrate
itself until it is completely independent, and to have its dwelling, so far
as it can, both now and in the future, alone and by itself, freed from the
shackles of the body . 1 1 2
Such is the Platonic spiritual exercise. But we must be wary of misinterpret­
ing it. In particular, we must not isolate it from the philosophical death of
Socrates, whose presence dominates the whole of the Phaedo. The separation
between soul and body under discussion here - whatever its prehistory - bears
absolutely no resemblance to any state of trance or catalepsy. In the latter, the
body loses consciousness, while the soul is in a supernatural visionary state. 1 13
All the arguments in the Phaedo, both preceding and following the passage
we have quoted above, show that the goal of this philosophical separation is
for the soul to liberate itself, shedding the passions linked to the corporeal
senses, so as to attain to the autonomy of thought. 1 14
We can perhaps get a better idea of this spiritual exercise i f we understand
it as an attempt to liberate ourselves from a partial, pasi;ionnte poin t of view
linked to the senses and the body so as to rise tu 1hc uni vcrN11I, 11or11111tivc

the norm of the Good. Training for death is trammg to die to one 's
individuality and passions, in order to look at things from t\le perspective of
universality and objectivity.
Such an exercise requires the concentration of thought upon itself, by
means of meditation and an inner dialogue. Plato alludes to this process in
the Republic, once again in the context of the tyranny of individual passions.
The tyranny of desire, he tells us, shows itself particularly c learly in dreams:
·

The savage part of the soul . . . does not hesitate, in thought, to try to
have sex with its mother, or with anyone else, man, god, or animal. I t
i s ready to commit any bloody crime; there i s n o food i t would not eat;
and, in a word, it does not stop short of any madness or shamcless­
ness.1 15
To liberate ourselves from this tyranny, we are to have recourse to a spiritual
exercise of the same type as that described in the Phaedo:
When, however, a man does not go to sleep before he has awakened his
rational faculty, and regaled it with excellent discourses and investig­
ations, concentrating himself on himself, having also appeased the
appetitive part . . . and calmed the irascible part . . . once he has calmed
these two parts of the soul, and stimulated the third, in which reason
resides . . . it is then that the soul best attains to truth. 1 1 6
Here we shall ask the reader's indulgence to embark on a brief digression.
To present philosophy as "training for death" was a decision of paramount
importance. As Socrates' interlocutor in the Phaedo was quick to remark, such
a characterization seems somewhat laughable, and the common man would be
right in calling philosophers moribund mopers who, if they are put to death,
will have earned their punishment well. 1 17 For anyone who ta.kes philosophy
seriously, however, this Platonic dictum is profoundly true. It has had an
enormous influence on Western philosophy, and has been taken up even by
such adversaries of Platonism as Epicurus and Heide g ger. Compared to this
formulation, the philosophical verbiage both of the past and of the present
seems empty indeed. In the words of La Rochefoucauld, "Neither the sun nor
death can be looked at directly." 1 1 8
,Indeed, the only ones even to auempl to do so are philosophers. Beneath
all their diverse conceptions of death, one common virtue recurs again and
agai n : lucidity. For Plato, he who has already tasted of the immortality of
t hought cannot he frightened by the idea of being snatched away from
Nensible l i fe For the Epicurean, the thought of death is the same as the
conNcimumcHN of t he fin i te muurc of cxiHtence, and it is this which gives an

Spiritual Exercises

incommensurable value: "Believe that each day that has dawned will be your
last; then you will receive each unexpected hour with gratitude." 1 1 9
In the apprenticeship of death, the Stoic discovers the apprenticeship of
freedom. Montaigne, in one of his best-known essays, That Philosophizing is
Learning how to Die, plagiarizes Seneca: "He who has learned how to die, has
un-learned how to serve." 1 20 The thought of death transforms the the tone
and level of inner life: "Keep death before your eyes every day . . . and then
you will never have any abject thought nor any excessive desire." m Thi s
philosophical theme, in turn, is connected with that of the infinite value of
the present moment, which we must live as if it were, simultaneously, both
the first moment and the last. 1 22
Philosophy is still "a training for dt.-ath" for a modern thinker such ao;
Heidegger. For him, the authenticity of existence consists in the lucid
anticipation of death, and it is up to each of us to choose between lucidity
and diversion. 1 23
For Plato, training for death is a spiritual exercise which consists in
changing one's point of view. We are to change from a vision of things
dominated by individual passions to a representation of the world governed
by the universality and objectivity of thought. This constitutes a conversion
(metastrophe) brought about with the totality of the soul. 124 From the
perspective of pure thought, things which are "human, all too human" seem
awfully puny. This is one of the fundamental themes of Platonic spiritual
exercises, and it is this which will allow us to maintain serenity in misfortunes:
The rational law declares that it is best to keep quiet as far as possible
in misfortune, and not to complain, because we cannot know what is
really good and evil in such things, and it does us no good for the future
to take them hard, and nothing in human life is worthy of great concern,
and our grieving is an obstacle to the very thing we need to come to our
aid as quickly as possible in such cases.
What do you mean?
To deliberate, I said, about what has happened to us, and, as in
dice-games, to re-establish our position according to whatever numbers
turn up, however reason indicates would be best, and . . . always
accustom the soul to come as quickly as possible to cure the ailing part
and raise up what has fallen, making lamentations disappear by means
of its therapy. 12 5
One could say that this spiritual exercise is already Stoic, 1 26 since in it we ca n
see the utilization of maxims and principles intended to " accustom the soul,"
and liberate it from the passions. Among these maxims, the one affirming t h e
unimportance of human affairs plays an im por t a n t role. Yet , in i 1 11 turn, 1 h i11
maxim is only the conseq uence of the movemen t dt•11crihcd in t he l'l1twln,

Spirilual E.wrcises

whereby the soul, moving from individuality to universality, rises to the level
of pure thought.
/
The three key concepts of the insignificance of human affairs, contempt for
death, and the universal vision characteristic of pure thought are quite plainly
linked in the following passage:
there is this further point to be considered in distinguishing the
philosophical from the unphilosophical nature . . . the soul must not
contain any hint of servility. For nothing can be more contrary than
such pettiness to the quality of a soul which must constantly strive to
embrace the universal totality of things divine and human . . . But that
soul to which pertain grandeur of thought and the conlemplation of the
totality of time and of being, do you think that it can consider human
life to be a matter of great importance? Hence such a man will not
suppose death to be terrible. 1 27
Here, "training for death" is linked to the contemplation of the Whole and
elevation of thought, which rises from individual, passionate subjectivity to
the universal perspective. In other words, it attains to the exercise of pure
thought. In this passage, for the first time, this characteristic of the
philosopher receives the appellation it will maintain throughout ancient
tradition: greatness of soul. 128 Greatness of soul is the fruit of the universality
of thought. Thus, the whole of the philosopher's speculative and contemplat­
ive effort becomes a spiritual exercise, insofar as he raises his thought up to
the perspective of the Whole, and liberates it from the illusions of indi­
viduality (in the words of Friedmann: "Step out of duration . . . become
eternal by transcending yourself").
From such a perspective, even physics becomes a spiritual exercise, which
is situated on three levels. In the first place, physics can be a contemplative
activity, which has its end in itself, providing joy and serenity to the soul, and
liberating it from day-to-day worries. This is the spirit of Aristotelian physics:
"nature, which fashioned creatures, gives amazing pleasure in their study to
all who can trace links of causation, and are naturally philosophers. "129 As we
have seen, it was in the contemplation of nature that the Epicurean Lucretius
found "a divine delight." 1 3° For the Stoic Epictetus, the meaning of our
existence resides in this contemplation: we have been placed on earth in order
to ,contemplate divine creation, and we must not die before we have witnessed
its marvels and lived in harmony with nature.131
Clearl y, the precise meaning of the contemplation of nature varies widely
from one p hil oso p h y to another. There is a great deal of difference between
A ristotelian physics, for example, and the feeling for nature as we find it in
Philo of A l e x 11 n d rin nnd Plutnrc h . It is n e v e rt h e l ess interesting to note with

festival?" "And a very splendid one, to be sure," continues Plutarch,

temples, and the one most fitting for the gods. Man is introduced into
it by birth to be a spectator: not of artificial, immobile statues, but of
the perceptible images of intelligible essences . . . such as the sun, the
moon, the stars, the rivers whose water always flows afresh , and the
earth, which sends forth food for plants and animals alike. A life which
is a perfect revelation, and an initiation into these mysteries, should be

Physics as a spi ritu a l exercise can also take on the form of an imaginative
"overflight,'' which causes human affairs to be regarded as of little import­
ance . 1 34 We encounter this theme in Marcus Aurelius:
Suppose you found yourself all of a sudden raised up to the heavens,
and that you were to look down upon h uman affairs in all their motley
diversity. You would hold them in contempt if you were to see, in the
same glance, how great is the number of beings of the ether and the air,
living round about you . 1 35
The same theme occurs in Seneca:
The soul has attained the culmination of happiness when, having
crushed underfoot all that is evil, it takes fli gh t and penetrates the inner
recesses of nature. I t is then, while wandering amongst the very stars,
that it l ikes to laugh at the costly pavements of the rich . . . But the sou l
cannot despise [all these riches] before it has been all around

the world ,
a con temptuous glance at t h e nnrrow globe of t h e earth from
above, snys to itself: "So t h i N i11 the pin- 1 min1 which 1111 n 1 1111 y n111 iun11

divide among themselves with fire and sword? How ridiculous are the
boundaries of men!" 1 l6
In this spiritual exercise of the vision of totality, and elevation of thought
to the level of universal thought, we can distinguish a third degree, in which
we come closer to the Platonic theme from which we started out. In the words
of Marcus Aurelius:
Don't limit yourself to breathing along with the air that surrounds you;
from now on, think along with the Thought which embraces all things.
For the intellective power is no less universally diffused, and does not
penetrate any the less into each being capable of receiving it, than the
air in the case of one capable of breathing it . . . you will make a large
room at once for yourself by embracing in your thought the whole
Universe, and grasping ever-continuing Time. 1 37
At this stage, it is as though we die to our individuality; in so doing, we
accede, on the one hand, to the interiority of our consciousness, and on the
other, to the universality of thought of the All.
You were already the All, but because something else besides the
All came to be added on to you, you have become less than the All, by
the very fact of this addition. For the addition did not come about
from being - what could be added to the All? - but rather from
not-being. When one becomes "someone" out of not-being, one is no
longer the All, until one leaves the not-being behind. Moreover, you
increase yourself when you reject everything other than the All, and
when you have rejected it, the All will be present to you . . . The All
had no need to come in order to be present. If it is not present, the reason
is that it is you who have distanced yourself from it. "Distancing
yourself" does not mean leaving it to go someplace else - for it would
be there, too. Rather, it means turning away from the All, despite the
fact that it is there. 1 Js
With Plotinus, we now return to Platonism. The Platonic tradition remained
faithful to Plato's spiritual exercises. We need only add that, in Neoplatonism,
th.e idea of spiritual progress plays a much more explicit role than in Plato's
wr i ti ngs . In Neoplatonism, the stages of spiritual progress corresponded to
d i fferent degrees of virtue. The hierarchy of these stages is described in many
Neoplaton ic texts, 1.111 s e r v i n g in particular as the framework for Marinus' Life
1fl'mdus.1�11 Por p hy ry , editor of Plotinus' Enneads, systematically arranged his
m11st er'M work accord in g to the stages of this spiritual progress. First, the soul

knowledge of, and subsequent passing beyond, the sensible world; finally, the
soul achieved conversion toward the Intellect and the One. HI
Spiritual exercises are a prerequisite for spiritual progress. In his treatise
On Abstinence from Animate Beings, Porphyry sums up the Platonic tradition
quite well. We must, he tells us, undertake two exercises (meletai): in the first
place, we must tum our thought away from all that is mortal and material.
Secondly, we must return toward the activity of the Intellect. m The first stage
of these Neoplatonic exercises includes aspects which are highly ascetic, in the
modem sense of the word: a vegetarian diet, among other things. In the same
context, Porphyry insists strongly on the importance of spiritual exercises.
The contemplation (theoria) which brings happiness, he tells us, does not
consist in the accumulation of discourse and abstract teachings, even if their
subject is true Being. Rather, we must make sure our studies are accompanied
by an effort to make these teachings become "nature and life" within us. 141
In the philosophy of Plotinus, spiritual exercises are of fundamental
importance. Perhaps the best example can be found in the way Plotinus
defines the essence of the soul and its immateriality. If we have doubts about
the immortality and immateriality of the soul, says Plotinus, this is because
we are accustomed to see it filled with irrational desires and violent sentiments
and passions.
If one wants to know the nature of a thing, one must examine it in its
pure state, since every addition to a thing is an obstacle to the knowledge
of that thing. When you examine it, then, remove from it everything
that is not i tsel f; better still remove all your stains from yourself and
el·amine yourse/j; and you will have faith in your immortality. 144
If you do not yet see your own beauty, do as the sculptor does with a
statue which must become beautiful: he removes one part, scrapes
another, makes one area smooth, and cleans the other, until he causes
the beautiful face in the statue to appear. In the same way, you too must
remove everything that is superfluous, straighten that which is crooked,
and purify all that is dark until you make it brilliant. Never stop
sculpting your own statue, until the divine splendor of virtue shines in
you . . . If you have become this . . . and have nothing alien inside you
mixed with yourself . . . when you see that you have become this . . .
concentrate your gaze and see. For it is only an eye such as this that can
look on the great Beauty. HS
Here we can see how the the demonstration of the soul's i mm a te rial ity has
been transformed into experience. Only he who liberates h imsel f 1md p u r i fies
himself from the p ass io ns , which conceal t he true rea l i t y of the 11oul, can
understand that the soul i1t i m m n 1 eriul nnd immorta l . Hrm\ knowledge Is

spiritual exercise. 146 We must first undergo moral purification, in order to
become capable of understanding.
When the object of our knowledge is no longer the soul, but the Intellect147
and above all the One, principle of all things, we must once again have
recourse to spiritual exercises. In the case of the One, Plotinus makes a clear
distinction between, on the one hand, "instruction," which speaks about its
object in an exterior way, and, on the other, the "path," which truly leads to
concrete knowledge of the Good: "We are instructed about it by analogies,
negations, and the knowledge of things which come from it . . . we are led
towards it by purifications, virtues, inner settings in order, and ascents into
the intelligible world. " 148 Plotinus' writings are full of passages describing
such spiritual exercises, the goal of which was not merely to know the Good,
but to become identical with it, in a complete annihilation of individuality. To
achieve this goal, he tells us, we must avoid thinking of any determinate
form,149 strip the soul of all particular shape,150 and set aside all things other
than the One. 1s1 It is then that, in a fleeting blaze of light, there takes place
the metamorphosis of the self:
Then the seer no longer sees his object, for in that instant he no longer
distinguishes himself from it; he no longer has the impression of two
separate things, but he has, in a sense, become anothe,.. He is no longer
himself, nor does he belong to himself, but he is one with the One, as
the centre of one circle coincides with the centre of another . 1 52

Leaming How to Read

In the preceding pages, we have tried to describe - albeit too briefly - the
richness and variety of the practice of spiritual exercises in antiquity. We have
seen that, at first glance, they appear to vary widely. Some, like Plutarch's
etl1ismoi, designed to curb curiosity, anger or gossip, were · only practices
intended to ensure good moral habits. Others, particularly the meditations of
the Platonic tradition, demanded a high degree of mental concentration.
Some, like the contemplation of nature as practiced in all philosophical
schools, turned the soul toward the cosmos, while still others - rare and
exceptional - led to a transfiguration of the personality, as in the experiences
o( Plotinus. We also saw that the emotional tone and notional content of these
exercises varied widely from one philosophical school to another: from the
mobilization of energy and consent to destiny of the Stoics, to the relaxation
and detachment of the Epicureans, to mental concentration and renunciation
of the 11 c n N i b l e world among the Platonists.

the rhetorical and dialectical techniques of persuasion, the attempts at
mastering one's inner dialogue, and mental concentration. In all philosophical
schools, the goal pursued in these exercises is self-realization and improve­
ment. All schools agree that man, before his philosophical conversion, is in a
state of unhappy disquiet. Consumed by worries, torn by passions, he does
not live a genuine life, nor is he truly himself. All schools also agree that man
can be delivered from this state. He can accede to genuine life, improve
himself, transform himself, and attain a state of perfection. It is precisely
for this that spiritual exercises are intended. Their goal is a kind of self­
formation, or paideia, which is to teach us to live, not in conformity with
human prejudices and social conventions - for social life is itself a product of
the passions - but in conformity with the nature of man, which is none other
than reason. Each in its own way, all schools believed in the freedom of the
will, thanks to which man has the possibility to modify, improve, and realize
himself. Underlying this conviction is the parallelism between physical and
spiritual exercises: just as, by dint of repeated physical exercises, athletes give
new form and strength to their bodies, so the philosopher develops his
strength of soul, modifies his inner climate, transforms his vision of the world,
and, finally, his entire being. 153 The analogy seems all the more self-evident
in that the gymnasion, the place where physical exercises were practiced, was
the same place where philosophy lessons were given; in other words, it was
also the place for training in spiritual gymnastics. 154
The quest for self-realization, final goal of spiritual exercises, is well
symbolized by the Plotinian image of sculpting one's own statue. 1 55 It is often
misunderstood, since people imagine that this expression corresponds to a
kind of moral aestheticism. On this interpretation, · its meaning would be to
adopt a pose, to select an attitude, or to fabricate a personality for oneself. In
fact, it is nothing of the sort. For the ancients, sculpture was an art which
"took away," as opposed to painting, an art which "added on." The statue
pre-existed in the marble block, and it was enough to take away what was
superfluous in order to cause it to appear . 1 56
One conception was common to all the philosophical schools: people are
unhappy because they are the slave of their passions. In other words, they are
unhappy because they desire things they may not be able to obtain, since they
are exterior, alien, and superfluous to them. It follows that happiness consists
in independence, freedom, and autonomy. In other words, happiness is the
return to the essential: that which is truly "ourselves," and which depends on
us.
This is obviously true in Platonism, where we find the famous image of
Glaucos, the god who lives in the depths of the sea. Covered as he is with
mud, seaweed, seashells, and pebbles, Glaucos is unre cogn i zn b l c , and the
same holds true for the soul: the body is a k i n d of thick, coarse crui;t , covcrinl(
and completely d isfiguring i t , 11n d t h e !ioul's t ru e nu t u rc would 11ppc11 r o n l y if

it rose up out of the sea, throwing off everything alien to it. 157 The spiritual
exercise of apprenticeship for death, which consists in separpting onesel f from
the body, its passions, and its desires, purifies the soul from all these
superfluous additions. It is enough to practice this exercise in order for the
soul to return to its true nature, and devote itself exclusively to the exercise
of pure thought.
Much the same thing can be said for Stoicism. With the help o f the
d istinction between what does and does not depend on us; we can reject all
that is alien to us, and return to our true selves. I n other words, we can
achieve moral freedom .
Finally, the same also holds true for Epicureanism. By ignoring unnatural
and unnecessary desires, we can return to our original n ucleus of freedom and
independence, which may be defined by the satisfaction of natural and
necessary desires.
Thus, all spiritual exercises are, fundamentally , a return to the self, in
which the self is liberated from the state of alienation into which it has been
plunged by worries, passions, and desires . The "self" liberated in this way is
no longer merely our egoistic, passionate individuality: it is our

moral person,

open to universality and objectivity, and participating in universal nature or
thought.
With the help of these exercises, we should be able to attain to wisdom;
that is, to a state of complete liberation from the passions, utter lucidity,
knowledge of ourselves and of the world . In fact, for Plato, Aristotle, the
Epicureans, and the Stoics, such an ideal of human perfection serves to define

divine perfection,

a state by definition inaccessible to man . 1 58 With the possible

exception of the Epicurean school, 1 59 wisdom was concei ved as an ideal after
which one strives without the hope of ever attaining it. Under normal
circumstances, the only state accessible to man is

philo-sophia:

the love of, or

progress toward, wisdom . For this reason, spiritual exercises must be taken
up again and again, in an ever-renewed effort.
The philosopher lives in an intermediate state. He is not a sage, but he is
not a non-sage, either.160 He is therefore constantly torn between the
non-philosophical and the philosophical life, between the domain of the
habitual and the everyday, on the one hand , and, on the other, the domain of
consciousness and lucidity. 1 61 To the same extent that the philosophical life is
equivalent to the practice of spiritual exercises, it is also a tearing away from
eyeryday life. It is a conversion , 1 62 a total transformation of one's vision,
life-style, and behavior.
Among the Cynics, champions of

askesis,

this engagement amounted to a

total break with the profane world, analogous to the monastic calling in
Christian i t y . The rupture took the form of a way of living, and even of dress,
cnm11lctcly fnreil{n to t h a t of the rest of mankind . This is why it was
11 1 1mc1 imcN Naid t h in C :yn iciNrn w11N not· n phi losophy in the proper sense of the

1 04

Spiritual Exercises

term, but a state of life (enslasis). 163 In fact, however, all philosophical schools
engaged their disciples upon a new way of life, albeit in a more moderate way.
The practice of spiritual exercises implied a complete reversal of received
ideas: one was to renounce the false values of wealth, honors, and pleasures,
and turn towards the true values of virtue, contemplation, a simple life-style,
and the simple happiness of existing. This radical opposition explains the
reaction of non-philosophers, which ranged from the mockery we find
expressed in the comic poets, to the outright hostility which went so far as to
cause the death of Socrates.
The individual was to be torn away from his habits and social prejudices,
his way of life totally changed , and his way of looking at the world radically
metamorphosed into a cosmic-"physical" perspective. We ought not to
underestimate the depth and amplitude of the shock that these changes could
cause, changes which might seem fantastic and senseless to healthy, everyday
common sense. It was impossible to maintain oneself at such heights
continuously; this was a conversion that needed always to be reconquered. It
was probably because of such difficulties that, as we learn in Damascius' Life
of lsidorus, the philosopher Sallustius used to declare that philosophy was
impossible for man . 1"' He probably meant by this that philosophers were not
capable of remaining philosophers at every instant of their lives. Rather, even
though they kept the title of "philosophers," they would be sure to fall back
into the habits of everyday life. The Skeptics, for instance, refused outright
to live philosophically, deliberately choosing to "live like everybody else," 1 65
although not until after having made a philosophical detour so intense that it
is hard to believe that their "everyday life" was quite s o "everyday" as the)
seem to have pretended.
Our claim has been, then, that philosophy in antiquity was a spiritual
exercise. As for philosophical theories: they were either placed explicitly in
the service of spiritual practice, as was the case in Stoicism and Epicureanism,
or else they were taken as the objects of intellectual exercises, that is, of a
practice of the contemplative life which, in the last analysis, was itself nothing
other than a spiritual exercise. It is impossible to understand the philosophical
theories of antiquity without taking into account this concrete perspective,
since this is what gives them their true meaning.
When we read the works of ancient philosophers, the perspective we have
described should cause us to give increased attention to the existential
attitudes underlying the dogmatic edifices we encounter. Whether we have to
do with dialogues as in the case of Plato, class notes as in the case of Aristotle,
treatises like those of Plotinus, or commentaries like those of Proclus, a
philosopher's works cannot be interpreted without taking into consideration
the concrete situation which gave birth to t h e m They arc the prod uct11 of n

-realization. Thus, the written work is a reflection of pedagogical, psycha­
gogic, and methodological preoccupations.
Although every written work is a monologue, the philosophical work is
always implicitly a dialogue. The d imension of the possible interlocutor is
always present within it. This explains the incoherencies and contradictions
which modern historians discover with astonishment in the works of ancient
philosophers. 1 66 In philosophical works such as these, thought cannot be
expressed according to the pure, absolute necessity of a systematic order.
Rather, it must take into account the level of the interlocutor, and the
concrete tempo of the logos in which it is expressed. It is the economy proper
to a given written logos which conditions its thought content, and it is the
logos that constitutes a living system which, in the words of Plato, "ought to
have its own body . . . it must not lack either head or feet: it must have a
middle and extremities so composed as to suit each other and the whole
work." 167
Each logos is a "system," but the totality of logfli written by an author does
nol constitute a system. This is obviously true in the case of Plato's dialogues,
but it is equally true in the case of the lectures of Aristotle. For Aristotle's
writings are indeed neither more nor less than lecture-notes; and the error of
many Aristotelian scholars has been that they have forgotten this fact, and
imagined instead that they were manuals or systematic treatises, intended to
propose a complete exposition of a systematic doctrine. Consequently, they
have been astonished at the inconsistencies, and even contradictions, they
discovered between one writing and another. As Diiring168 has convincingly
shown, Aristotle's various logoi correspond to the concrete situations created
by specific academic debates. Each lesson corresponds to different conditions
and a specific problematic. It has inner unity, but its notional content docs
not overlap precisely with that of any other lesson . Moreover, Aristotle had
no intention of setting forth a complete system of reality . 1 69 Rather, he wished
to train his students in the technique of using correct methods in logic, the
natural sciences, and ethics. During gives an excellent description of the
Aristotelian method:
the most characteristic feature in Aristotle is his incessant discussion of
problems. Almost every important assertion is an answer to a question
put in a certain way, and is valid only as an answer to this particular
, question. That which is really interesting in Aristotle is his framing of
the problems, not his answers. It is part of his method of inquiry to
approach a problem or a group of problems again and again from
d i llcrcn t anglc..'S. His own words are a.U.17vapz q JI Tr0l1]C1aµEIJOl ["now,

of the soul . . . in each case the answer is the consequence of the manner
in which he posits the problem. In short, it is possible to explain this
type of inconsistencies as natural results of the method he applies. 170
In the Aristotelian method of "different starting-points," we can recognize
the method Aristophanes attributed to Socrates, and we have seen to what
extent all antiquity remained faithful to this method. 171 For this reason,
During's description can in fact apply, mutatis mutandis, to almost all the
philosophers of antiquity. Such a method, consisting not in setting forth a
system, but in giving precise responses to precisely limited questions, is the
heritage - lasting throughout antiquity - of the dialectical method; that is to
say, of the dialectical exercise.
To return to Aristotle: there is a profound truth in the fact that he himself
used to call his courses metlwdoi. 172 On this point, moreover, the Aristotelian
spirit corresponds to the spirit of the Platonic Academy, which was, above all,
a school which formed its pupils for an eventual political role, and a research
institute where investigations were carried out in a spirit of free discussion. 173
It may be of interest to compare Aristotle's methodology with that of
Plotinus. We learn from Porphyry that Plotinus took the themes for his
writings from the problems which came up in the course of his teaching. m
Plotinus' various logoi, situated as they are within a highly specific problem­
atic, are responses to precise questions. They are adapted to the needs of his
disciples, and are an attempt to bring about in them a specific psychagogic
effect. We must not make the mistake of imagining that they are the
successive chapters of a vast, systematic exposition of Plotinus' thought. In
each of these logoi, we encounter the spiritual method particular to Plotinus,
but there is no lack of incoherence and contradictions on points of detail when
we compare the doctrinal content of the respective treatises. 175
When we first approach the Neoplatonic commentaries on Plato and
Aristotle, we have the impression that their form and content are dictated
exclusively by doctrinal and exegetical considerations. Upon closer examin­
ation, however, we realize that, in ·each commentary, the exegetical method
and doctrinal content arc functions of the spiritual level of the audience to
which the commentary is addressed. The reason for this is that there existed
a cursus of philosophical instruction, based on spiritual progress. One did not
read the same texts to beginners, to those in progress, and to those already
having achieved perfection, and the concepts appearing in the commentaries
are also functions of the spiritual capacities of their addressees. Consequently,
doctrinal content can vary considerably from one commentary to another,
even when written by the same author. This docs not mean that the
commentator changed his doctrines, but that the needs of his disciples were
differcnt.176 In the literary genre of parene.fis, used for e x h o r ti n g beginners, one
could, in order to bring about 11 specific e ffect i n t he i n t erlnc u t or'N Nnu l , u t i lize

the arguments of a rival school. For example, a Stoic might say, "even if
pleasure is the good of the soul (as the Epicureans would ha1ve it), nevertheless
we must purify ourselves of passion." m Marcus Aurelius exhorted himself in
the same manner. If, he writes, the world is a mere aggregate of atoms, as the
Epicureans would have it, then death is not to be feared.178
Moreover, we ought not to forget that many a philosophical demonstration
derives its evidential force not so much from abstract reasoning as from an
experience which is at the same time a spiritual exercise. We have seen that
this was the case for the Plotinian demonstration of the immortality of the
soul. Let the soul practice virtue, he said, and it will understand that it is
immortal.179 We find an analogous example in the Christian writer Augustine.
In h i s On the Trinity, Augustine presents a series of psychological images of
the Trinity which do not form a coherent system , and which have con­
sequently been the source of a great deal of trouble for his commentators. In
fact, however, Augustine is not trying to present a systematic theory of
trinitarian analogies. Rather, by making the sou l turn inward upon itself, he
wants to make it experience the fact that it is an image of the Trinity. In his
words: "These trinities occur within us and are within us, when we recall ,
look a t , and wish for such things." 1 80 Ultimately, i t i s i n the triple act o f
remembering God, knowing God, and loving God that the soul discovers
itself to be the image of the Trinity.
From the preceding examples, we may get some idea of the change in
perspective that may occur in our reading and interpretation of the philosoph­
ical works of antiquity when we consider them from the point of view of the
practice of spiritual exercises. Philosophy then appears in i ts original aspect:
not as a theoretical construct, but as a method for training people to live and
to look at the world in a new way. It is an attempt to transform mankind.
Contemporary historians of philosophy are today scarcely inclined to pay
attention to this aspect, although it is an essential one. The reason for this is
that, in conformity with a tradition inherited from the Middle Ages and from
the modern era, they consider philosophy to be a purely abstract-theoretical
activity. Let us briefly recall how this conception came into existence.
It seems to be the result of the absorption of philosophia by Christianity .
Since its inception, Christianity has presented itself as a philosophia, insofar
as it assimilated into itself the traditional practices of spiritual exercises. We
see this occurring in Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Augustine, and monasti­
ci:im. 1"1 With the advent of medieval Scholasticism , however, we find a clear
distinction being drawn between theologia and philosophia. Theology became
conscious of its autonomy qua supreme science, while philosophy was emptied
of i t s spirit ual exercises which, from now on, were relegated to Christian
m ys ti cis m nnd ethics. Red uced to the rank of a "handmaid of theology,"

ht•ncc purely t hcoret ie.:nl
mnterinl . When, in the modern age, philosophy

108

Spiritual Exercises

regained its autonomy, it still retained many features inherited from this
medieval conception. In particular, it maintained its purely theoretical
character, which even evolved in the direction of a more and more thorough
systematization.182 Not until Nietzsche, Bergson, and existentialism does
philosophy consciously return to being a concrete attitude, a way of life and
of seeing the world. For their part, however, contemporary historians of
ancient thought have, as a general rule, remained prisoners of the old, purely
theoretical conception of philosophy. Contemporary structuralist tendencies
do not, moreover, incline them to correct this misconception, since spiritual
exercises introduce into consideration a subjective, mutable, and dynamic
component, which does not fit comfortably into the structuralists' models of
explanation.
We have now returned to the contemporary period and our initial point of
departure, the lines by G. Friedmann we quoted at the beginning of this
study. We have tried to reply to those who, like Friedmann, ask themselves
the question: how is it possible to practice spiritual exercises in the twentieth
century? We have tried to do so by recalling the existence of a highly rich and
varied Western tradition. There can be no question, of course, of mechan­
ically imitating stereotyped schemas. After all, did not Socrates and Plato urge
their disciples to find the solutions they needed by themselves? And yet, we
cannot afford to ignore such a valuable quantity of experience, accumulated
over millennia. To mention but one example, Stoicism and Epicureanism do
seem to correspond to two opposite but inseparable poles of our inner life:
tension and relaxation, duty and serenity, moral conscience and the joy of
existence.1K3
Vauvenargues said , "A truly new and truly original book would be one
which made people love old truths." 1 "" It is my hope that I have been "truly
new and truly original" in this sense, since my goal has indeed been to make
people love a few old truths. Old truths: . . . there are some truths whose
meaning will never be exhausted by the generations of man . It is not that they
are difficult; on the contrary, they are often extremely simple.m Often, they
even appear to be banal. Yet for their meaning to be understood, these truths
must be lived, and constantly re-experienced. Each generation must take up,
from scratch, the task of learning to read and to re-read these "old truths."
We spend our lives "reading," that is, carrying out exegeses, and sometimes
even exegeses of exegeses. Epictetus tells us what he thinks of such activities:
"Come and listen to me read my commentaries . . . I will explain
Chrysippus to you like no one else can, and I'll provide a complete
analysis of his entire text . . . If necessary, I can even add the views of
Antipater and Archedcmos" . So it's for this, is it, thnt you ng men

And yet we have forgotten how to read: how to pause, liberate ourselves from
our worries, return into ourselves, and leave aside our searc)J for subtlety and
originality, in order to meditate calmly, ruminate, and let the texts speak to
us. This, too, is a spiritual exercise, and one of the most difficult. As Goethe
said : "Ordinary people don't know how much time and effort it takes to learn
how to read. I've spent eighty years at it, and I still can't say that I've reached
my goal." I B7

1 977, shortly before his death, Friedmann was kind enough to write me to tell
me how much he had been "moved" by my reaction to his book. In the same
letter, he referred me to the final remarks he had presented at the close of the
Colloquium organdies by the CNRS [National Centre of Scientific Research],
3-5 May, 1977, to commemorate the tricentenary of the death of Spinoza.
There, apropos of a passage from Spinoza's Ethics, he spoke of the Stoicism of
the ancients. Cf. Georges Friedmann, "Le Sage et notre siecle," Revue de
SJmtlitse 99 ( 1 978), p. 288.
Friedmann, la P11issance, pp. 1 83-284.
Epictetus, Disco11rses, 3, 22, 20: "From now on my mind [tlianoia] is the material
with which I have to work, as the carpenter has his timbers, the shoemaker his
hides."
[Ignatius of Loyola (ca. 1 49 1 - 1 556), founder of the Jesuit Order, wrote his
handbook entitled Spirit11n l E.\·ercises beginning in 1 522. The goal of the work was
to purify its reader from sin and lead him to God, via a four-stage meditation:
beginning with meditation on sin, the reader progresses to considering the
kingdom of Christ, the passion, and finally the risen and glorified Lord. - Trans.]
In Latin literature, cf. , for example, Rufinus, History of the Monks [written
ca. AD 403], ch. 29, PL 2 1 , 4100: "Cum quadraginta annis fuisset in excrci­
tiis spiritualibus conversatus" ["After he had become t.-onversant with spiritual
exercises for forty years" - Trans.], and ch. 29 (ibid., col. 4530) : "Ad acriora
semetipsum spiritalis vitae cxtendit exercitia" ["He exerted himself to the more
zealous exercises of the spiritual life." - Trans.].
In the Greek world, we find this terminology already in Oement of Alexandria,
Stromata, 4, 6, 27, I. Cf. J. Leclercq, "Exercices spirituels," in Dict iormaire tie
Spiritualite, vol. 4, cols 1 902-8.
In his very important work Seelenfiihrung. Methodik der E:A.·erzitien in der Antike,
Munich 1 954, Paul Rabbow situated Ignatius of Loyola's Exercitia spiritualia back
within the ancient tradition .
There have been relatively few studies devoted to this subject. The fundamental
work is th11r of Rabbow, Seelerljuhrrmlf, cf. also the review of Rabbow's work by

"Vain is the word of that philosopher which does not heal any suffering of man."

17 Cf. below. We find the distinction between what depends on us and what does
not depend on us in Epictetus, Discourses, I, 1 , 7; I, 4, 27; I, 22, 9; 2, 5, 4; and
Epictetus, Manual, ch. 4.
18 Many Stoic treatises entitled On Exercises have been lost; cf. the list of titles in
Diogenes Laertius, 7, 1 66-7. A short treatise entitled On Exercise, by Musonius
Rufus, has been preserved (pp. 22-7 Hense). After a general introduction
concerning the need for exercises in philosophy, Rufus recommends physical
exercises: becoming used to foul weather, hunger, and thirst. These exercises
benefit the soul, giving it strength and temperance. He then recommends
exercises designed particularly for the soul, which, says Rufus, consist in steeping
oneself in the demonstrations and principles bearing on the distinction between
real and apparent goods and evils. With the help of these exercises, we will get
into the habit of not fearing what most people consider as evils: poverty,
suffering, and death. One chapter of Epictetus' Disco1mes is dedicated to askesis
(3, 1 2, 1-7). Cf. bc:low . The: t rea t i se 011 Exerdse by the PseudoPlutarch, preserved
in Arabic (cf. J. Gildmeister and F. Bilcheler, "PseudoPlutarchos Peri askisefis,"
Rheit1isches Museum NF 27 ( 1 872), pp. 520-38), is of no particular interest in this
context.

2 1 The word therapeiai can also mean acts o f worship, and this meaning would be
entirely possible in Philo's mind. Nevertheless, in the present context it seems to
me that it designates the therapeutics of the passions. Cf. Philo Judaeus, On 1/1e

24 The idea o f tension (tonos) i s particularly in evidence i n Epictetus, Discourses, 4,

examples in Plutarch, see Ingcnkamp, Plutarchs Schrifien, pp. 99ff.
36 Marcus Aurelius, Medi1a1ior1s, 1, 58: "In every contingency, keep before .vour e.ves
those who, when the same thing befell them, were saddened, astonished,
resentful. Where are they now? Nowhere." Epictetus, Manual, ch. 2 1 : "Keep
before .vour e.ves every day death and exile, and everything that seems terrible, but
most of all death; and then you will never have any abject thought, nor excessive
desire." On this exercise, see Rabbow, Seelenj'iihrU11g, p. 330.
37 Cf. the passage from Philo cited above. Hijmans, AJ:KEJ:IJ:, p. 69, calls attention
to the frequency of the expression "Remember!" i n Epictetus. It recurs quite
often in Marcus Aurelius, for instance, Meditations, 2, 4; 8, 1 5 ; 29. Cf. Galen,
Galer1 On the Passions and E"ors of the So11/, l , 5, 25, p. 1 9, 8- 1 0 Marquardt:
"With the help of memory, keep 'at hand' the ugliness of those who succumb to
anger, and the beauty of those who master it."
38 It is only after much hesitation that I have translated mtlete by "meditation. " In
fact, melett and iL'I Latin equivalent meditatifl designate "preparatory exercises,"
in particular those of rhetoricians. If 1 ha\•e finally resigned myself to adopting
the translation "meditation," it is because the exercise designated by mtltte
corresponds, in the last analysis, rather well to what we nowadays term
meditatio11: an effort to assimilate an idea, notion, or principle, and make
them come alive in the soul. We must not, however, lose sight of the term's am­
biguity: meditation is exercise, and exercise is meditation. For instance, the "pre­
meditation" of death is a "pre-exercise" of death; the (Oltidiana meditatio cited in
the following note could just as well be translated as "daily exercises. "
3 9 See Rabbow, See/enfiih rung, pp. 23- 1 50, 325-8; and Seneca, On Benefits, 1 , 2, 1 :
"These are the things that my friend Demetrius says the beginner in philosophy
must grasp with both hands, these arc the precepts that he must never let go.
Rather, he must cling fast to them and make them a part of himself, and by daily
meditation reach the point where thc.'lc salutary maxims occur to him of their
own accord." Cf. also Galen, Ga/e11 011 t/1e Passior1s anti E"nrs 1if tl1t Soul, l , 5,

Philo's ex press i on "indifference to indifferent things" corres pon d s exactly to the

soul finds within itself the power to live a perfec tly happy l i fe, if we can
remain in d i ffe re n t towards indifferent things." This formula seems to be a
reminiscence of the definition of the goal of human life according to Aristo of
Chios ( S VF, 1, §360, = Clement of Alexandria, Stromatfl, 2, 2 1 , 1 29, 6, p. 1 83,
1 4- 1 6 Stiihlin): "And why should I ment io n A risto? He sai d the goal was
indifference, but he leaves 'the indifferent' as simply 'the indifferent.' " On this
theme, see below. We must bear in mind that here "indifference" does not mean
a lac k of interest, but rather equal love for each of li fe's instants; that is, we are
not to make any "difference" between them.

On the one hand, it illustrates the fact that Epicurean physics was a true source
of pleasure for the sage: it allowed him to have a grandiose imaginative vision of
the formation and dissolution of the universe in the infinity of space. On the
other, it throws light on one of the most fundamental feelings of the human
experience: l1orror in the face of the enigma of nature. One thinks of Goethe's
formulation in

Faust, Part 2, 6272ff: "The shudder is the best part of man.

The prehistory of spiritual exercises is to be sought, first of all, in traditional rules
of life and popular exhortation (cf. I. Hadot, Seneca, pp. 1 0-22). Must we go back
further still, and look for it first of all in Pythagoreanism, and then, beyond
Pythagoras, in magico-religious/shamanistic traditions of respiratory techniques
and mnemonic exercises? This theory, defended by E.R. Dodds, The Greeks and
the lrratio11al (= Sather Classical Lectures 25), 3rd edn, Berkeley/London 1 963;

is entirely plausible. However, I shall not go into the matter here, first of all
owing to my lack of competence in the field of the anthropology of prehistory
and of archaic Greece, and secondly, because it seems to me that the problems
inherent in the history of Pythagoreanism are extremely complex, so that it
presupposes a rigorous criticism of our sources (many of which are late, idyllic
projections, reflecting Stoic and Platonic concepts). Thirdly, the spiritual exer­
cises under discussion here are mental processes which have nothing in common
with cataleptic trances, but, on th� contrary, respond to a rigorous demand for
rational control, a demand which, as far as we are concerned, emerges with the
figure of Socrates.
The historical Socrates is a probably insoluble enigma. But the figure of
Socrates, as it is sketched by Plato, Xenophon, and Aristophanes, is a well­
attested historical fact. When, in what follows, I speak of "Socrates," I
shall be referring to this figure o f Socrates. See below, ch. 5 , "The Figure of
Socrates."
By using quotation marks, I wish to underline the fact that we arc not
dealing with authentically Socratic dialoi,'U cs, but with literary composit ions
which imitate - more or less faithfully - the dinlogues o f SocrnteH, or in which
the figure of Socrates plays a ro l e h is in this sense thnt Plotn111 JinlogueR 11rc

82 Plato, Laches, 1 87e- 1 88b.
83 Aristotle, Soph istical Refutations, 1 83b8: "Socrates used to ask _questions and not
to answer them - for he used to confess that he did not 1'now." Cf. Plato,
Apology, 2 l d5: "I do not think that I know what I do not know."
84 Plato, Apology, 30e l-5: "If you put me to death, you will not easily find anyone
to take my place . . . God has specially appointed me to this city, as though it
were a large thoroughbred horse which . . . needs the stimulation of some
stinging fly."
85 On taking care of oneself, cf. Plato, Apology, 29d; 31 b; 36c.
86 Ibid, 29d5-e3 . Cf. 30a6-b l : "For I spend my time going about trying to persuade
you, young and old, to make your first and chief concern not for your bodies nor
for your possessions, but for the highest welfare of your souls."
87 Plato, Apo/11gy, 36b4-c6.
88 Plato, Symposium, 2 1 5e6-2 1 6a5.
89 In this respect, Stoic exhortation remains Socratic. More than one of Epictetus'
Di1&ourses seems to imitate the Socratic style; cf., for instance, Discourses, I, 1 1 ,
1 -40. Epictetus praises the Socratic method ,t 2, 1 2 , 5-1 6, but he empha.'lizes
that, in his day, it is no longer easy to practice it: "Nowadays, especially in Rome,
it is not at all a safe business" (2, 1 2, 1 7; 24). Epictetus pictures a philosopher
trying to have a Socratic dialogue with a consular personage, and ending up
receiving a fist in the face. If we can trust Diogenes Laertius, LiVts of th e
Philosophers, 2, 2 1 , a similar incident had happened to Socrates himself.
90 On the history of this theme, see Pierre Courcelle, Connais-toi toi-mime. De
So(rate ti sa int Bernard, 3 vols, Paris 1 974-- 5 .
91 Plato, Symposium, 1 74d.
92 Plato, ibid, 220c--d.
93 Aristophanes, Clouds, 700-6, · 76 1-3; cf. 740-5. As a matter of fact, the true
meaning of these verses is not entirely clear. They could be interpreted as an
allusion to an exercise of mental concentration; this is the view of G. Meautis,
l 'time hellb1ique, Paris 1 932, p. 1 83; A.-J . Festugiere, Contemplation ti vie
conttmplatit-e selon Platot1, 2nd edn, Paris 1 950, pp. 67-73; W. Schmid, "Das
Sokratcsbild der Wolken," Phitologus 91 ( 1 948), pp. 209-28; A.E. Taylor, Vaina
Socratica, Oxford 1 9 1 1 , pp. 1 29 7 5 . The terms ph rontizein and ekphrontizein,
used in Aristophanes' description, became - perhaps under Aristophanes'
influence - technical terms for designating Socrates' habits. Cf. Plato, Symposium,
220c: Socrates stays standing, phrontizot1 ti; Xenophon, Symposium, 6, 6: Socrates
is nicknamed the plirontislts. But it is not certain that, in Aristophanes, this
phrontizein corresponds to an exercise of meditation directed towards oneself. In
the first place, the comparison with the may-beetle gives us to understand that
thought takes flight toward "elevated" things. In his Symposium, Xenophon tells
us it relates to the "meteora," in other words to celestial phenomena (cf. Plato,
Ap11logy, 1 8b). Secondly, in the Clouds, Strepsiades phrontizei about the means he
will use to settle a business affair, not about himself. It is more a question of the
mcr hmlo lo1n· of research (cf. I . 742 : 1lit1ide nod e.wm1ine). The most interesting

"If an

idea gets you into

any difficulty, let go of it, withdraw for a bit, then submit it to your judgement

again, shift it around and weigh it carefully." This means that, when one
arrives at an aporia, one must take up the question again, from a new point of
departure. This method is constantly applied in the Platonic dialogues, as has
been shown by Rene Schaerer, La Question platonidenne.

This passage is quoted by Plato, Republic, 44 1b: "there Homer has clearly
represented that in us which has reflected about the better and the worse as
rebuking that which feels unreasoning anger as if it were a distinct and different
thing." Cf. Phaedo, 94d-e.

Plato, Statesman, 285c-d.
Ibid, 286d. In the words of Schaercr (La Question platonicienne, p. 87): "Defini­
tions arc worthless in and of themselves. Their entire value consists in the road
travelled to achieve them. Along the way, the interlocutor acquires more met11a l
penetration (Sophist, 227a-b), more cotifidence ( Theaetttus, 1 87b), and more
skillfulness in all things (Statesma n 285dff). His soul is thereby purified, as he
rejects the opinions which formerly barred the way co enlightenment (Sophist,
230b-c). But whatever words one uses to designate this dialectical progress, it
always takes place in the soul of the interlocutor - and, by the same token, in the
soul of the intelligent reader."
Cf. Schaerer, La Question platonicienne, pp. 38-44; Goldschmidt Les dialogues, pp.
79-80, 292, an d 34 1 : "The Republic solves the problem of Justice and its
advantages. At the same time, and by the same token, i t urges us on towards

conformed to "life," i.e. to the opinions of non-philosophers. But he did so with
indifference, that is, wjth an inner freedom which preserved his serenity and
peace of mind. This is, incidentally, the same Pyrrho who, when frightened by

Ancient Spiritual Exercises
and "Christian Philosophy"

It was the great merit of Paul Rabbow to have shown, in his Seelmfiihrung, 1
in what sense the methods of meditation set forth and practiced in Ignatius
of Loyola's Exercilia spirilua/ia2 were deeply rooted in the spiritual
exercises of ancient philosophy. Rabbow begins his book by discussing the
various techniques by means of which rhetoricians throughout antiquity
sought to persuade their audiences. These included, for example, oratorical
amplification and lifelike, stirring descriptions of events.3 Above all, Rabbow
gives a remarkable analysis of the exercises practiced by the Stoics and
Epicureans, emphasizing the point that they were spirilual exercises of
the same kind as we find in Ignatius of Loyola. On both these points,
Rabbow's book opened the way to new areas of research. It is possible,
however, that even the author himself did not foresee all the consequences of
his d iscovery.
In the first place, Rabbow seems to me to have linked the phenomenon of
spiritual exercises too closely to what he terms the "inward orientation"
(lnnenwendung)• which, he claims, took place in the Greek mentality in the
third century BC, and which manifested itself in the development of the Stoic
and Epicurean schools. As a matter of fact, however, this phenomenon was
much more widespread . We can already detect its outlines in the So­
cratic/Platonic dialogues, and it continues right up until the end of antiquity.
The reason for this is that it is linked to the very essence of ancient
philosophy. It is philosophy itself tha t the ancients thought of as a spiritual
exercise.
If Rabbow tends to limit the extent of spiritual exercises to the Hellenis­
tic/Roman period, the reason is perhaps that he restricts himself to consider­
ing their ethical aspect alone. Moreover, he considers eth ics only i n
philosophies like S toicism a n d Epicurcanism, which uppcnr to 1u:cord 1irc-

dominance to ethical questions in their instruction. In fact, Rabbow goes so
far as to define spiritual exercises as moral exercises:
By "moral exercise," we mean a procedure or determinate act, intended
to influence oneself, carried out with the express goal of achieving a
determinate moral effect. It always looks beyond itself, in as much as it
repeats itself, or at least is linked together with other acts to form a
methodical ensemble.5
With the advent of Christianity, Rabbow continues, these moral exercises
were transformed into spiritual exercises:
Spiritual exercises, then, which resemble moral exercises like a twin,
both in essence and structure, were raised to their classical rigor and
perfection in the Exercitia spiritua/ia of Ignatius of Loyola. Spiritual
exercises thus belong properly to the religious sphere, since their goal is
to fortify, maintain, and renew life "in the Spirit," the vita spiritualis. 6
Christian spiritual exercises did indeed take on a new meaning by virtue of
the specific character of Christian spirituality, inspired as it is by the death of
Christ and the Trinitarian life of the divine Persons. But to speak, apropos of
the philosophical exercises of antiquity, of simple "moral exercises" is to
misunderstand their importance and significance. As we showed above, these
exercises have as their goal the transformation of our vision of the world, and
the metamorphosis of our being. They therefore have not merely a moral, but
also an existential value. We are not just dealing here with a code of good
moral conduct, but with a way of being, in the strongest sense of the term. In
the last analysis, then, the term "spiritual exercises" is the best one, because
it leaves no doubt that we are dealing with exercises which engage the totality
of the spirit. 7
Secondly, one gets the impression from reading Rabbow that Ignatius of
Loyola rediscovered spiritual exercises thanks to the sixteenth-century
renaissance of rhetorical studies.8 In fact, however, rhetoric for the ancients
was only one of many ingredients of exercises which were first and foremost
philosophical in the strict sense of the term. Moreover, ever since the first
centuries of the church's existence, Christian spirituality has been the heir of
anc;.ient philosophy and its spiritual practices. There was thus nothing to
prevent Ignatius from finding the methodology for his Exercitia within the
Christian tradition itself. In the following pages, we hope to show, with
the help of a few quotations, in what way ancient spiritual exercises
were preserved and transmitted by an entire current of ancient
Christian tho u ic h t: t h a t current, namely, which defined Christianity itself as

Spiritual Exercises

Before we begin our study, we must be more specific about the notion of
spiritual exercises. "Exercise" corresponds to the Greek terms askesis or
melete. Let us be clear at the outset about the limits of the present inquiry:
we shall not be discussing "asceticism" in the modem sense of the word, as
it is defined, for instance, by Heussi: "Complete abstinence or restriction in
the use of food, drink, sleep, dress, and property, and especially continence
in sexual matters. " 9 Here, we must carefully distinguish between two
d ifferent phenomena. On the one hand, there is the Christian
and
subsequently modem - use of the word "asceticism", as we have just seen it
defined. On the other, there is use of the word askesis in ancient philosophy.
For ancient philosophers, the word askesis designated exclusively the spiritual
exercises we have discussed above: 1 0 inner activities of the thought and the
will. Whether or not sexual or alimentary practices analogous to those of
Christian asceticism existed among certain ancient philosophers - the Cynics,
for example, or the Neoplatonists - is a wholly different question. Such
practices have nothing to do with philosophical thought-exercises. This
question has been competently dealt with by many authors,1 1 who have shown
both the analogies and the differences between asceticism (in the modern
sense of the word) in ancient philosophy and in Christianity. What we
propose to examine here is rather the way in which as/mis, in the philosophical
sense of the term, was received into Christianity.
In order to understand the phenomenon under consideration, it is essential
to recall that there was a widespread Christian tradition which portrayed
Christianity as a philosop�y. This assimilation began with those Christian
writers of the second century who are usually referred to as the Apologists, and
in particular with Justin. The Apologists considered Christianity a philosophy,
and to mark its opposition to Greek philosophy, they spoke of Christianity as
"our philosophy" or as "Barbarian philosophy." 12 They did not, however,
consider Christianity to be just one philosophy among others; they thought of
it as the philosophy. They believed that that which had been scattered and
dispersed throughout Greek philosophy had been synthesi7.ed and systematized
in Christian philosophy. Each Greek philosopher, they wrote, had possessed
only a portion of the Logos, 13 whereas the Christians were in possession of the
logos itself, incarnated in Jesus Christ. If to do philosophy was to live in
accordance with the law of reason, then the Christians were philosophers, since
they lived in conformity with the law of the divine Logos. 1•
Clement of Alexandria dwells at length on this theme. He establishes a close
link between philosophy and paideia, by which he means the education of
mankind. Already within Greek philosophy, the Logos, or divine pedagogue,
had been at work educating humanity, but Christianity itself, as the complete
revelation of the logos, was the true philosophy1 5 which "teaches us to
conduct ourselves so that we may resemble God , and to n cce p l the d iv i n e plan
[oikonomia l as the guiding princi p le of a l l our cd uc111 ion . 11 16

The identification of Christianity with true philosophy inspired many
aspects of the teaching of Origen, and it remained influentiaL throughout the
Origenist tradition, especially among the Cappadocian Fathers: Basil of
Caesarea, Gregory Nazianzen, and Gregory of Nyssa. It is also in evidence in
John Chrysostom. 17 All these authors speak of "our philosophy"; of the
"complete philosophy"; or of "the philosophy according to Christ. "
We may well ask ourselves if such an identification was legitimate, and
wonder whether it did not contribute to a large extent to the notorious

"Hellenization" of Christianity, about which so much has been written. I will
not go into this complex problem here, but shall limit myself to pointing out
that in portraying Christianity as a philosophy, this tradition was the heir almost certainly consciously so - of a tendency already at work in the Jewish
tradition, particularly in Philo of Alexandria. 18 Philo portrayed Judaism as a
patrios phi/osophia: the traditional philosophy of the Jewish people. The same
terminology was used by Flavius Josephus. 19
When, a few centuries later, monasticism came to represent the culmination
of Christian perfection, it, too, could be portrayed as a philosophia. From the
fourth century on, this is exactly how it was in fact described, by church
Fathers such as Gregory Nazianzen,20 Gregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysos­
tom,2 1 and especially by Evagrius Ponticus.22 This viewpoint was still current
in the fifth century, for instance in Theodoret of Cyrrhus.13
Here again, it was Philo of Alexandria who had shown the way. He had
given the name "philosophers" to the Therapeutae, who, according to his
description,24 lived in solitude, meditating on the law and devoting themselves
to contemplation. Jean Leclercq25 has shown that, under the influence of
Greek tradition, the monastic life continued to be designated by the term
phi/osophia throughout the Middle Ages. Thus, a Cistercian monastic text tells
us that Bernard of Clairvaux used to initiate his disciples "into the disciplines
of celestial philosophy. " 26 Finally, John of Salisbury maintained that it was
the monks who "philosophized" in the most correct and authentic way.27
The importance of this assimilation between Christianity and philosophy
cannot be over-emphasized . Let us be clear on one point, however: there can
be no question of denying the incomparable originality of Christianity. We
shall return to this point later; in particular, we shall emphasize the
specifically Christian character of this "philosophy," as well as the care
Christians have taken to connect it with the biblical/ evangelical tradition.
Moreover, the tendency to assimilation was confined within strict historical
limits, and always linked more or less closely to the tradition of the Apologists
and of Origen. This tendency did, however, exist; its importance was
considerable, and its result was the introduction of philosophical spiritual
exe rc i ses into Christianity .

from primitive Christianity. This fact is highly significant: it shows that if
Christianity was able to be assimilated to a philosophy, the reason was that
philosophy itself was already, above all else, a way of being and a style of life.
As Jean Leclercq points out: "In the monastic Middle Ages, just as much as
in Antiquity, philosophia did not designate a theory or a means of knowledge,
but a lived, experienced wisdom, and a way of living according to reason. " za
We remarked above29 that the fundamental attitude of the Stoic philosopher
was prosoche: attention to oneself and vigilance at every instant. For the Stoics,

the person who is "awake" is always perfectly conscious not only of what he
does, but of what he is. In other words, he is aware of his place in the universe
and of his relationship to God. His self-consciousness is, first and foremost,
a moral consciousness.
A person endowed with such consciousness seeks to purify and rectify his
intentions at every instant. He is constantly on the lookout for signs within
himself of any motive for action other than the will to do good . Such
self-consciousness is not, however, merely a moral conscience; it is also cosmic
consciousness. The "attentive" person lives constantly in the presence of God
and is constantly remembering God, joyfully consenting to the will of
universal reason, and he sees all things with the eyes of God himself.
Such is the philosophical attitude par excellence. It is also the attitude of the
Christian philosopher. We encounter this attitude already in Clement of
Alexandria, in a passage which foreshadows the spirit which was later to reign
in philosophically-inspired monasticism : "It is necessary that divine law
inspire fear, so that the philosopher may acquire and conserve peace of mind
[amerimtiia], by dint of prudence [eulabeia] and attention to himself [prosoche],
and that he may remain exempt from sins and falls in all things." JO For
Clement, the divine law is simultaneously the universal reason of the
philosophers, and the divine word of the Christians. It inspires fear, not in
the sense of a passion - which, as such, would be condemned by the Stoics but rather in the sense of a certain circumspection in thought and action.
Such attention to oneself brings about amerimnia or peace of mind, one of the
most sought-after goals in monasticism.
Attention to oneself is the subject of a very important sermon by Basil of
Caesarea.31 Basil bases his sermon on the Greek version of a passage from
Deuteronomy: "Give heed to yourself, lest there be a hidden word in your
heart." 32 On this basis, Basil develops an entire theory of prosoche, strongly
influenced by ·the Stoic and Platonic traditions. We shall return to this point
later. For the moment, let us simply note that Basil's reason for commenting
on this particular passage of Deuteronomy is that, for him, it evokes a technical
term of ancient philosophy. For Basil, attention to oneself consists in
awakening the rational principles of thought an d action wh ich God has placed
in our souls.33 We arc to watch over 011rselves that is, over our 11piri1 and our
soul - nnd nol over th111 w h ic h i11 m m (our bod y) or 1 hn 1 whkh iN rllmul 11/11mt

us (our possessions).3'1 Thus, prosoche consists i n paying attention to the
beauty of our souls, by constantly renewing the examination 06 our conscience
and our knowledge of ourselves.35 By so doing, we can correct the judgments
we bring upon ourselves. If we think we are rich and noble, we are to recall
that we are made of earth, and ask ourselves where are the famous men who
have preceded us now. If, on the contrary, we are poor and in disgrace, we
are to take cognizance of the riches and splendors which the cosmos offers us:
our body, the earth, the sky, and the stars, and we shall then be reminded of
our divine vocation.36 It is not hard to recognize the philosophical character
of these themes.
Prosoche or attention17 to oneself, the philosopher's fundamental attitude,
became the fundamental attitude of the monk. We can observe this phenome­
non in Athanasius' Life of Antony, written in AD 357. When describing the
saint's conversion to the monastic life, Athanasius simply says: "He began to
pay attention to himself." 38 Antony himself, we read later, is supposed to have
said to his disciples on his deathbed : "Live as though you were dying every
day, paying heed to yourselves fprosechontes heautois] and remembering what
you heard from my preaching." 39
In the sixth century, Dorotheus of Gaza remarked: "We are so negligent
that we do not know why we have gone ou t of the world . . . That is why we
are not making progress . . . The reason for it is that there is no prosocke in
our hearts." "° As we have seen;• attention and vigilance presuppose continuous
concentration on the present moment, which must be lived as if it were,
simultaneously, the first and last moment of life. Athanasius tells us that
Antony used to make no attempt to remember the time he had already spent
at his exercises, but rather made a brand new effort every day, as if starting
afresh from zero.42 In other words, he lived the present moment as if it were
his first, but also his last. We also saw that Antony told his disciples to "Live
as though you were dying every day." 43 Athanasius reports another of
Antony's sayings: "If we live as if we were going to die each day, we will not
commit sin. " -H We arc to wake up thinking it possible that we may not make
it until the evening, and go to sleep thinking that we shall not wake up.45
Epictetus had spoken along similar lines: "Let death be before your eyes every
day, and you will never have any abject thought nor excessive desire." 46
In the same vein, Marcus Aurelius wrote: "Let your every deed and word
and thought be those of one who might depart from this life this very
moment." 47 Dorotheus of Gaza also established a close link between prosocke
and the imminence of death: "Let us pay heed to ourselves, brothers, and be
vigilant while we still have time . . . Look! Since the time we sat down at this
conference we have used up two or three hours of our time and got that much
nearer to death . Y ct though we see that we are losing time, we are not
afraid l " 48 And again: "Let us pay heed to ourselves and be vigilant, brothers.
Who w i l l l(ivc UK hack t he present time if we w111nc it?" 4'1

132

Spiritual Exercises

Attention to the present is simultaneously control of one's thoughts,
acceptance of the divine will, and the purification of one's intentions with
regard to others. We have an excellent summary of this constant attention to
the present in a well-known Meditation of Marcus Aurelius:
Everywhere and at all times, it is up to you to rejoice piously at what is
occurring at the present moment, to conduct yourself with justice towards
the people who are present here and now, and to apply rules of
discernment [emphilotekhnein] to your present representations [ phanta­
sia1] , so that nothing slips in that is not objcctive.50
We encounter the same continuous vigilance over both thought and
intentions in monastic spirituality, where it is transformed into the "watch of
the heart," s i also known as nepsis 52 or vigilance. We are not dealing here with
a mere exercise of the moral conscience. Rather, prosoche relocates man within
his genuine being: that is, his relationship to God. It is thus equivalent to the
continuous exercise of the presence of God. In the words of Plotinus' disciple
Porphyry: "Let God be present as overseer and guardian of every action, deed
and word! " s3 Here we have one o f the fundamental themes o f philosophical
prosoche: presence both to God and to oneself.
"Have your joy and your rest in one thing only: in progressing from
one action done for the sake of others to another such act, always accom­
panied by the remembrance of God." 5� This Meditation of Marcus Aurelius
has to do, once again, with the theme of exercises involving the presence of
God. At the same time, it introduces to us an expression which was later
to play an important role in monastic spirituality. The "remembrance of
God" is a perpetual reference to God at each instant of life. Basil of
Cacsarca links it explicitly with the "watch of the heart": "We must keep
watch over our heart with all vigilance . . . to avoid ever losing the
thought of God . " ss Diadochus of Photicc often evokes this theme. For him,
the remembrance of God is entirely equivalent to prosocl1e: "Only they know
their failures who never let their intellects be distracted from the remem­
brance of God ." 56 "Since then [i.e. since its fall], it is only with difficulty that
the human intellect can remember God and His commandments."57 We are
to
close off all the intellect's avenues of escape, by means of the remem­
brance of God.58
What distinguishes a man who is virtue's friend is that he constant­
ly consumes everything that is earthly in his heart by means of
the remembrance of God, so that, bit by bit, the evi l in it is d is­
persed by t h e fire of t h e 1·cmembrnncc of t he Uood , nn<l hi11 11oul

returns in perfection to its natural brilliance; nay, even with increased
splendor.59
Clearly, remembrance of God is, in some sense, the very essence of prosoche.
It is the most radical method for ensuring one's presence to God and to
oneself.6Cl Vague intentions, however, are not sufficient for true attention to
one's self. We noted that Diadochus of Photice speaks of the "remembrance
of God and of His commandments." In ancient philosophy as well, prosoche
required meditating on and memorizing rules of life (kanones), those prin­
ciples which were to be applied in each particular circumstance, at each
moment in life. It was essential to have the principles of life, the fundamental
"dogmas," constantly "at hand. "
W e encounter this same theme once again in the monastic tradition. Here,
however, philosophical dogmas are replaced by the Commandments as an
evangelical rule of life, and the words of Christ, enunciating the principles of
Christian life. Yet the rule of life could be inspired not only by the evangelical
commandments, but also by the words of the "ancients;" in other words, of
the first monks. We have only to recall Antony, on his deathbed, recommend­
ing that his disciples remember his exhortations. 6 1 Evagrius Ponticus declares:
" It is a very nece&-sary thing . . . to examine carefully the ways of the monks
who have traveled, in an earlier age, straight along the road and to direct
oneself along the same paths." 62
Both the evangelical commandments and the words of the ancients were
presented in the form of short sentences, which - just as in the philosophical
tradition - could be easily memorized and meditated upon. The numerous
collections of Apophlhegmata and of Kephalaia we find in monastic literature
are a response to this need for memorization and meditation . Apophthegmata63
were the famous sayings which the ancients - that is to say, the Desert
Fathers - pronounced in specific circumstances. This literary genre was
already in existence in the philosophical tradition, and we find numerous
examples of it in the works of Diogenes Laertius. As for Ke_phalaia,64 these
are collections of relatively short sentences, usually grouped into "centuries. "
This, too, was a literary genre much in vogue in traditional philosophical
literature; some examples are Marcus Aurelius' Meditations and Porphyry's
Sentences. Both these literary genres are responses to the requirements of
meditation.
Like philosophical meditation, Christian meditation flourished by using
al l available means of rhetoric and oratorical amplification, and by mobilizing
all possible resources of the imagination. Thus, for example, Evagrius
Ponticus used to invite his disciples to imagine their own death, the
decomposition of their bodies, the terrors and sufferings of their souls in Hell,
ilnd eternal fire; then, by way of contrast, they were to picture the happiness
of 1 hc ju111 .M

Meditation must, in any case, be constant. Dorotheus of Gaza insists
strongly on this point:
Meditate constantly on this advice in your hearts, Brothers. Study the
words of the holy Elders.66
If we remember the sayings of the holy Elders, brothers, and meditate
on them constantly, it will be difficult for us to sin.67
If you wish to possess these sayings at the opportune moment, meditate
on them constantly. 68
In the spiritual life, there is a kind of conspiracy between, on the one
hand, normative sayings, which are memorized and meditated upon, and, on
the other, the events which provide the occasion for putting them into
practice. Dorotheus of Gaza promised his monks that, if they constantly
meditated on the "works of the holy Elders," they would "be able to profit
from everything that happens to you, and to make progress by the help of
God." 69 Dorotheus no doubt meant that after such meditation, his
monks would be able to recognize the will of God in all events,
thanks to the words of the Fathers, which were likewise inspired by the will
of God.
Vigilance and self-attention clearly presuppose the practice of examining
one's conscience. We have already seen, in the case of Basil of Caesarea,711 the
close link between prosoche and the examination of conscience. It seems that
the practice of the examination of the conscience occurs for the first rime,
within the Christian tradition, in Origen 's Commentary on the Song of Songs. 7 1
In the course of his interpretation of verse l : 81 "Unless thou know thyself,
0 fair one among women," 72 Ori gen explains that the soul must examine its
feelings and actions. Does it have the good as a goal? Does it seek after the
various virtues? Is it making progress? For instance, has it completely
suppressed the passions of anger, sadness, fear, and love of glory? What is its
manner of giving and receiving, or of judging the truth?
This series of questions, devoid as it is of any exclusively Christian feature,
takes its place in the philosophical tradition of the examination of conscience,
as it had been recommended by the Pythagoreans, the Epicureans, the Stoics
- especially Seneca and Epictetus - and many other philosophers, such as
Plutarch and Galen .7l We find the practice recommended again by John
Chrysostom,7� and especially by Dorotheus of Gaza:
We ought not only to examine ourselves every day but also every season,
every month, and every week, and ask ourselves: "What stage nm I at
now with regards to the pm1sion by which I waN overcome luNt week ? "

Ancienl Spiritual Exercises

135

Similarly every year: "Last year I was overcome b y such and such a
passion; how about now?"
The Fathers have told us how useful it is for each of us to puri fy
himself in tum, by examining, every evening, how we have spent the
day, and every morning, how we have spent the night . . . . Truly,
however, we who sin so much and are so forgetful, really need to
examine ourselves every six hours also, so that we may know how we
have spent these hours and in what way we have sinned.75
In this regard there is an interesting detail in Athanasius' Life of Antony.
According to his biographer, Antony used to recommend to his disciples that
they take written notes of the actions and movements of their souls. It is
possible that written examinations of conscience were already part of the
philosophical tradition;76 they would have been useful, if not necessary, in
order to ensure that the investigation was as precise as possible. For Antony,
however, the important aspect was the therapeutic value of writing: "Let each
one of us note and record our actions and the stirrings of our souls as though
we were going to give an account of them to each other. " 77 Surely, he
continues, we would not dare to commit sins in public, in full view of others:
"Let this record replace the eyes of our fellow ascetics." According to Antony,
the act of writing gives us the impression of being in public, in front of an
audience. We can also discern the therapeutic value of writing in a passage in
which Dorotheus of Gaza reports that he felt "help and relier• 78 by the mere
fact of having written to his spiritual director.
Another interesting psychological point: Plato and Zeno had remarked that
the quality of our dreams allows us to judge the spiritual state of our soul.79
We find this observation repeated by Evagrius Ponticus80 and Diadochus of
Photice.81
Finally, prosoche implies self-mastery. That is, it implies the triumph of
reason over the passions, since it is the passions that cause the distraction,
dispersion, and dissipation of the soul. Monastic literature insists tirelessly on
the misdeeds of the passions, which were often personified in demoniacal
form.
Many recollections of ancient philosophy were preserved in monastic
exercises of self-mastery. For instance, we find Dorotheus of Gaza, like
Epictetus, advising his disciples to begin by training themselves in little
th,ings, so as to create a habit,82 before moving on to greater things. Similarly,
he advises them to diminish the number of their sins bit by bit, in order to
defeat a passion.u We find Evagrius Ponticus proposing that one passion
ought to be combated by means of another - fornication, for instance, by the
concern for one's good reputation - as long as it remains impossible to combat
t h e passion directly by the virtue which is opposed to it. This was the method
alread y KUl(Ke11tcJ by Cicero in hiK 1i11rn/a11 Disp"tations.84

Spiritual Exercises

We said above that Christianity's acceptance of spiritual exercises had
introduced into it a certain spiritual attitude and style of life which it had
previously lacked. As an example, let us consider the concept of exercises as
a whole. In the very process of performing repetitious actions and undergoing
a training in order to modify and transform ourselves, there is a certain
re flectiv ity and distance which is very different from ev angel ica l spontaneity.
Attention to oneself - the essence of prosoche - gives rises to a whole series of
techniques of introspection. It engenders a n extraordinary finesse in the
exami nation of conscience and spiritual discernment. Most significantly, the
ideal sought after in these exercises, and the goals proposed for the spiritual
life, became tinged with a strong Stoico-Platonic coloration; that is to say,
since by the end o f antiquity Neoplatonism had integrated Stoic ethics within
itself, that they were deeply infused with Neoplatonism. This is the case, for
i nstan ce, in Dorotheus of Gaza, who d esc ri bes spiritual perfection in com­
pletely Stoic terms: it is the transformation of the will so that it becomes
identified with the D i v in e Will :
He who has no will of his own always does what he wishes. For since
he has no will of h i s own, everything that ha ppen s satisfies him. He
finds himself doing as he wills all the time, for h e does not want things
to be as he wills them, but he wills that they be just as they arc.85
The most recent editors of Dorotheus compare this text with a passage from
the Manual of Epictetus: "Do not seek to have everything that happens
happen as you wish , but wish for everything to happen as it actually does
happen, and your life will be serene." Rb
S pi r i tua l pe rfecti o n is also depicted a s apalheia - th e comp l ete absence of
passions - a Stoic concept taken up by Ncoplatonism. For Dorotheus of Gaza,
apatheia is the end-res ul t of the annihilation of one's own will: "From this
cutting off of self-will a man procures for h i mse l f detachment [aprospatheia],
a nd from detachment he comes, with the he l p of God, to perfect apatheia. " R7
We may note in passing that the means Dorotheus recommends for cutting
off self-will are wholly identical to the exercises of self-mastery of the
phi losophi cal tradition. In order to cure curiosity, for instance, Plutarch
advised people not to read funeral epitaphs, not to snoop on their neighbors,
and to turn their backs on street scenes.RR Similarly, Dorotheus advises us not
to look in the direction where we want to look; not to ask the cook what he's
prep ar i n g for d in n er ; and not to join in a conversation we find already
underway.89 This is what Dorotheus means by "cutting off self-will. "
I t is with Evagrius, however, that w e can see most clearly just how c lose ly
Christian apatheia can be linked to philosop h ica l concepts. I n E va gri us '
Praktikos, we find th e following definition : "The K inicdom of Heaven is
apalheia of the soul a lo n g w i th true know lcd1o1c of c 1 d111 i n 1o1 1 h i n1i111. ' ""1 W hen

1 37

Ancient Spiritual Exercises

we turn to comment on a formula such as this, we find how great is the

distance separating such speculations from the evangelical spir) t. As we know,
the evangelical message consisted in the announcement of an eschatological

event called "the Kingdom of Heaven" or "the Kingdom of God . " Evagrius
begins by differentiating between the two expressions, and interpreting them
in a highly personal way . Enlarging upon the Origenist tradition,91 he
considers that the two expressions designate two inner states of the soul. More
precisely, they designate two stages of spiritual progress:
The Kingdom of Heaven is

apatheia

of the soul along with true

knowledge of existing things.
The Kingdom of God is knowledge of the Holy Trinity co-extensive
with the capacity of the intelligence and giving it a surpassing incorrup­
tibility .92
Two levels of knowledge are distinguished here: the knowledge of beings and
the knowledge of God . We then realize that this distinction corresponds
exactly to a d ivision of the parts of philosophy which was well known to
Origen, and is attested in Platonism at least since the time of Plutarch .93 In
chis division, three separate stages or levels of spiritual progress are distin­
guished, which correspond to the three parts of philosophy: ethics - or
" practics,'' as Evagrius calls it - physics, and theology. Ethics corresponds to
initial purification, physics to definitive detachment from the sensible world
and contemplation of the order of nature; finally, theology corresponds to
contemplation of the principle of all things. According to the Evagrian
schema, however, ethics corresponds to

praktike,

physics to "the Kingdom of

Heaven," which includes the true knowledge of beings, and theology corres­
ponds to "the Kingdom of God ," which is the knowledge of the Trinity . In
Neoplatonic systematization, these degrees also correspond to degrees of
virtue. Accord ing to Porphyry,94 the soul begins by utilizing the
virtues to dominate the passions
the level of the

kathartic

via

political

the state of metriopatheia. It then rises to

virtues. These virtues begin to detach the soul from

the body , but do not yet do so completely; this is only the beginning of

apatheia. Not until the level of the theoretical virtues
full apatheia and perfect separation from the body. It

does the soul attain to
is at this level that the

soul is able to contemplate the forms within the divine intellect, which are the
moqels for the phenomenal world . 95 This level, characterized by

apatheia

and the contemplation of existents, corresponds to Evagrius' "Kingdom
of Heaven . "

According

to

Evagrius,

the

soul

now

contemplates

the

m u ltiplicity of physeis ("natures"; hence the denomination "physical"): on the

one hand, the intelligible forms, and on the other the logoi of sensible
bcings.''6 The final stage, noetic in nature, is the contemplation of God

up h is thought in these terms: "Christianity is

the doctrine of Christ our Savior. It is composed of praktike, of physics, and
of theology. " 97
Apatheia plays an essential role, not only in theoretical constructions such
as Evagrian metaphysics, but also in monastic spirituality. There, its value is
closely linked to that of peace of mind and absence of worry: amerimnia98 or
tranqui/litas.99 Dorotheus of Gaza100 does not hesitate to declare that peace of
mind is so important that one must, if necessary, drop what one has
undertaken if one's peace of mind is endangered. Peace of mind tranquillitas
animi
had, moreover, always been a central value within the philosophical
tradition.101
For Porphyry, as we have seen , apatlreia was a result of the soul's
detachment from the body. Here we touch once again upon the philosophical
exercise par excellence. As we saw above, Plato had declared: "those who go
about philosophizing correctly are in training for death." 102 As late as the
seventh century, we still find the echo of this saying in Maximus Confessor:
"In conformity with the philosophy of Christ, let us make of our life a
training for death ." ioJ
Yet Maximus himself is only the inheritor of a rich tradition, which
repeatedly identified Christian philosophy with training for death. We en­
counter this theme already in Clement of Alexandria, 1114 who understood such
training in a thoroughly Platonic sense, as the attempt spiritually to separate
the soul from the body. For Clement, perfect knowledge, or gnosis, is a kind
of death. It separates the soul from the body, and promotes the soul to a life
entirely devoted to the good, allowing it to devote itself to the contemplation
of genuine realities with a purified mind . Again, the same motif recurs in
Gregory Nazianzen : "Make of this life, as Plato said , a training for death, while
- to speak in his terms - separating the soul from the body as far as
05
possible." 1 "This," he tells us, "is the practice of philosophy. " Evagrius, for
his part, expresses himself in terms strikingly similar to Porphyry's:
-

-

To separate the body from the soul is the privilege only of Him who
has joined them together. But to separate the soul from the body lies as
well in the power of the person who pursues virtue. For our Fathers
gave to the training for death and to the flight from the body a special
name: anachoresis [i.e. the monastic life]. 1 06
It is easy to see that the Platonic concept of the flight from the body, which
exercised such an attraction upon the young Augustine, was an element added 0'1
to Christianity, and not essential to it. Nevertheless, this concept determined the
orientation of the whole of Christian spirituality in a quite specific direction.
So far, we have noted the permanent survival of ce r t ain philosophical spiritual
exercises in Christianity and mono11tici11m, nnd we hnvc tried to make

Ancient Spiritual Exercises

1 39

comprehensible the particular tonality that their reception introduced into
Christianity. We must not, however, exaggerate the i"'l>ortance of this
phenomenon. In the first place, as we have said, it manifested itself only in a
rather restricted circle: among Christian writers who had received a philosoph­
ical education. Even in their case, however, the final synthesis is essentially
Christian .
To be sure, our authors strove to Christianize their borrowings as much as
possible; but this is perhaps the least important aspect of the matter. They
believed they recognized spiritual exercises, which they had learned through
philosophy, in specific scriptural passages. Thus, we saw Basil of Caesarea
making a connection between prosoche and a text from Deuteronomy . 107 Then,
in Athanasius' Life of Antony, and throughout monastic literature, prosoche
was transformed into the "watch of the heart," under the influence of
Proverbs, 4:23: "Above all else, guard your heart." 1118 Examination of one's
conscience was often justified by the Second Letter to the Corinthians, 1 3 : 5 :
"Examine yourselves . . . and test yourselves." 109 Finally, the meditation on
death was recommended on the basis of First Corinthians, 1 5 : 3 1 : "I die every
day." u o
Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to believe that these references were
enough, all by themselves, to Christianize spiritual exercises. The reason why
Christian authors paid attention to these particular biblical passages was that
they were already familiar, from other sources, with the spiritual exercises of
prosoche, meditation on death, and examination of the conscience. By them­
selves, the texts from scripture could never have supplied a method for
practicing these exercises. Often, in fact, a given scriptural passage has only
a distant connection with a particular spiritual exercise.
More important is the overall spirit in which Christian and monastic
spiritual exercises were practiced. They always presupposed the assistance of
God's grace, and they made of humility the most important of virtues. In the
words of Dorotheus of Gaza: "The closer one comes to God, the more one
sees oneself as a sinner." 1 1 1 Such humility makes us consider ourselves
inferior to others. It leads us to maintain the greatest reserve in both conduct
and speech, and to adopt certain significant bodily positions, for instance
prostration before other monks.
Two .other fundamental virtues were penitence and obedience. Penitence,
inspired by the fear and love of God, could take the form of extremely severe
self-mortification. The remembrance of death was intended not only to make
people realize the urgency of conversion, but also to develop the fear of God.
In turn, it is linked to meditation on the Last Judgment, and thereby to the
v i rtue of penitence. The same holds true of the examination of conscience.
Obedience - the renunciation of one's own will, in complete submission to
the orders of o s up e rio r - completely transformed the philosophical practice
of s1> i r i l ual d i recl ion. We can Nee 10 juHI wh a t ex t re m es such obedience could

140

Spiritual Exercises

be taken in Dorotheus' Life ofDositheus. 112 The director of conscience had an
absolute power of decision over his disciple's possessions, eating habits, and
entire way of life.
In the final analysis, all these virtues were transfigured by the transcendent
dimension of the love of God and of Christ. Thus, to train for death, or to
separate the soul from the body, was at the same time to participate in the
death of Christ. To renounce one's will was to adhere to divine love.
Generally speaking, we can say that monasticism in Egypt and Syriam was
born and developed in a Christian milieu, spontaneously and without the
intervention of a philosophical model. The first monks were not cultivated
men, but Christians who wanted to attain to Christian perfection by the
heroic practice of the evangelical prescriptions, and the imitation of the Life
of Christ. It was, therefore, natural that they should seek their techniques of
perfection in the Old and the New Testament. Under Alexandrian influence,
however - the distant influence of Philo, and the more immediate influence
of Origen and Clement of Alexandria, magnificently orchestrated by the
Cappadocians - certain philosophical spiritual techniques were introduced
into Christian spirituality. The result of this was that the Christian ideal was
described, and, in part, practiced, by borrowing models and vocabulary from
the Greek philosophical tradition. Thanks to its literary and philosophical
qualities, this tendency became dominant, and it was through its agency that
the heritage of ancient spiritual exercises was transmitted to Christian
spirituality: first to that of the Middle Ages, and subsequently to that of
modern times.

The Figure of Socrates

Since the dawn of Greek thought, the sage has functioned as a living, concrete
model. Aristotle testifies to this in a passage from his Protrepticus: "What more
accurate standard or measure of good things do we have than the Sage?" 1
There were several reasons for the fact that my research on the sage as a model
gradually became fixed upon Socrates. In the first place, I found in him a
figure who had exercised a widespread influence of the greatest importance on
the entire Western tradition. Secondly, and most importantly, the figure of
Socrates - as sketched by Plato, at any rate - had, it seemed to me, one unique
advantage. It is the portrait of a mediator between the transcendent ideal of
wisdom and concrete human reality. It is a paradox of highly Socratic irony
that Socrates was not a sage, but a "philo-sopher": that is, a lover of wisdom.
To speak about Socrates is, of course, to expose oneself to all sorts of
historical difficulties. The accounts we have of him by Plato and by
Xenophon have transformed, idealized, and deformed the historical Socrates.2
I shall not attempt here to uncover or reconstruct the historical Socrates.
Instead, what I shall try to set forth is the figure of Socrates, as it has
influenced our Western tradition. Since this is a phenomenon of imme nse
proportions, however, I shall restrict myself to two of its aspects: the figure
of Socrates as depicted in Plato's Symposium, and as it was perceived by those
two great Socratics, Kierkegaard3 and Nietzsche. 4

Silenus

Socrates thus functions as a mediator between ideal norms and human reality.
The concepts of "mediation" and "intermediate" call to mind the ideas of
equilibrium and the Golden Mean. We should therefore expect to see in
Socrates a harmonious figure, combining divine and human characteristics in
llcl icutc

n u 1mccN.

148

Figures

Nothing could be further from the truth. The figure of Socrates is
ambiguous, troubling, and strangely disconcerting. The first surprise in store
for us is his physical ugliness, which is well attested by the testimony of Plato,
Xenophon, and Aristophanes.5 "It is significant," wrote Nietzsche, "that
Socrates was the first great Hellene to be ugly." 6 "Everything in him is
exaggerated, bujfo, a caricature." 7 Nietzsche goes on to evoke his "crab-like
eyes, puffed-up lips, and hanging belly," 8 and he takes pleasure in telling the
story of how the physiognomist Zopyrus once told Socrates he was a monster,
keeping hidden within himself the worst vices and appetites. Socrates, says
Nietzsche, simply replied: "How well you know me! " 9 If Socrates really did
resemble a Silenus, as he is depicted in Plato's Symposium,10 such suspicions
were quite understandable. In popular imagination, Sileni and satyrs were
hybrid demons, half-animal, half-men, who made up the escort of Dionysos.
These impudent, ribald buffoons also constituted the chorus of satyr-plays, a
literary genre of which Euripides' Cyclops is one of the few remaining
examples.
The Sileni were purely natural beings. They stood for the negation of
culture and civilization, for grotesque buffoonery, and for the license of the
instincts.1 1
To use Kierkegaard's expression, Socrates was a cobold. 12 To b e sure, Plato
gives us to understand that Socrates' resemblance to Silenus was only an
appearance, beneath which something else was hidden. Alcibiades, in his
famous speech in praise of Socrates at the end of the Symposium, 1 .i compares
Socrates to the little statues of Sileni that could be found in sculptors' shops,
which concealed little figurines of the gods inside themselves. Similarly,
Socrates' exterior appearance - ugly, buffoon-like, impudent, almost mon­
strous - was only a mask and a facade.
Here we are led to another paradox: Socrates was not only ugly, but a
dissimulator as well. Nietzsche writes: "Everything in him is concealed ,
ulterior, subterranean . " 14 Socrates masks himself, and at the same time is used
as a mask by others.
Socrates masks himself: here we encounter that famous Socratic irony, the
meaning of which we shall have to clarify later on. Socrates pretends to be
ignorant and impudent. "He spends his whole life," says Alcibiades, "playing
the part of a simpleton and a child. " i; "The nouns and verbs which form the
outer envelope of his words arc like the hide of an impudent satyr. "11' His
ignorant appearance and amorous attentions "are what he has wrapped around
himself, like a carved Silenus." 17
Socrates pulled off his enterprise of dissimulation so well that he succeeded
in definitively masking h imself from history. He wrote nothing, engaging only
in dialogue. All the testimonies we possess about him hide him from us more
than they reveal him, precisely because Socrates hns n lw ny N been UNed 11s n
mask by those who have spoken nhoul h i m .

The Figure of Socrates

Because he was himself masked, Socrates became the prosopon, or mask, of
personalities who felt the need to take shelter behind hinl. It was from him
that they got the idea both to mask themselves, and to u�e Socratic irony as
a mask. We have here a phenomenon extremely rich in its literary, pedagog­
ical, and psychological implications.
The original nucleus of this phenomenon was the irony of Socrates himself.
Socrates, the eternal interrogator, used skillful questions to bring his inter­
locutors to admit their ignorance. By so doing, he disturbed them so much
that they were eventually led to question their entire lives. After Socrates'
death, the memory of his Socratic conversations inspired a new literary genre,
the logoi sokratikoi, which imitated the conversations Socrates had had with a
wide variety of interlocutors. In these logoi sokratikoi, Socrates became a
prosopon - an interlocutor or character - and hence, if we recall the meaning
of prosopon in the ancient theater, a mask. Especially in the subtle, refined
form given it by Plato, the Socratic dialogue was i ntended to provoke in its
readers an effect analogous to that produced by the living discourse of
Socrates himself. Thus, the reader of these dialogues finds himself in the same
situation as Socrates' interlocutors: he does not know w�ere Socrates'
questions are going to lead him. Socrates' elusive, unsettling prosopo n /mask
sows disquiet in the soul of the reader, leading it to a heightening of
consciousness which may go as far as far as a philosophical conversion. As
Konrad Gaiser has convincingly shown,'8 the reader himself is invited to take
refuge behind the mask of Socrates. In almost all Plato's Socratic dialogues,
there comes a moment of crisis, when the interlocutors are overcome by
discouragement. They no longer have confidence in the possibility of
continuing the discussion, and it seems as though the dialogue is about to be
broken off. This is where Socrates intervenes: he takes the others' doubt,
uneasiness, and discouragement upon himself. He assumes all the risks of the
dialectical adventure, and carries out a complete switching of roles. If the
enterprise fails, it will henceforth be his responsibility. In this way, he shows
his interlocutors a projection of their own selves. They can now transfer their
personal uneasiness onto Socrates, and regain confidence in dialectical
research and in the logos itself.
In his dialogues, Plato too uses Socrates as a mask, or, in Nietzsche's
terminology, as a "semiotics. " 19 As Paul Friedlander2° has pointed out,
whereas the "ego" had long since made its appearance in Greek literature ,Hesiod, Xenophanes, Parmenides, Empedocles, the Sophists, and even Xeno­
phon do not hesitate to speak in the first person - Plato completely effaces
himself beh ind Socrates in his dialogues, and systematically avoids the use of
the fi rst person s i n g u lar We arc d e al i n g here with an cxl rcmcly subtle

for members of the Academy, and his written dialogues, in which he utilized
the mask of Socrates to exhort his readers to philosophy? Alternatively,
should we conclude that Plato uses the figure of Socrates to set forth his
doctrines with a certain degree of distance and irony? In any case, this initial
situation has indelibly influenced Western consciousness. Whenever thinkers
have been aware of - and frightened by - the radical renewal of which they
were the bearers, they too have used a mask to confront their contemporaries.
They have usually chosen to use the ironic mask of Socrates.
When, in the nineteenth century, j.G. Hamann praised Socrates in his
Socratic Memorabilia, he did so, to use his own term, to mimike. 22 In other
words, Hamann himself took up the mask of Socrates - the rationalist par
excellence in the eyes of the eighteenth ccntury21 - in order to make people
see, behind the mask, a figure prophetic of Christ.
What, for Hamann, was only a temporary expedient became a fundamental,
existential attitude for Kierkegaard. Kierkegaard's penchant for masks is most
evident in his use of pseudonyms. As is well known, most of Kierkegaard's
works were first published under a variety of pseudonyms: Victor Eremita,
Johannes Oimacus, etc. Wc are not dealing here with an editorial caprice.
Rather, for Kierkegaard, all these pseudonyms correspond to different levels
- the "aesthetic," "ethical," and "religious" - at which the author was
supposed to be situated . Kierkegaard speaks successively of Christianity as an
aesthete, then as a moralist, in order to force his contemporaries into the
awareness that they are not true Christians. "He hid himself beneath the mask
of an artist and half-believing moralist to speak about what he believed most
deeply." 24
Kierkegaard was perfectly aware of the Socratic character of his method:
From the point of view of my whole activity as an author, integrally
conceived, the aesthetic work is a deception, and herein is to be found
the deeper significance of the use of pseudonyms. A deception, however,
is a rather ugly thing. To this I would make answer: One must not let
oneself be deceived by the word "deception. " One can deceive a person
for the truth's sake, and (to recall old Socrates) one can deceive a person
into the truth. Indeed, it is only by this means, i.e. by deceiving him,
that it is possible to bring into the truth one who is in an illusion.25
Kierkegaard's goal was to make the reader aware of his mistakes, not by
directly refuting them, but by setting them forth in such a way that their
absurdity would become clearly apparent. This is as Socratic as can be. At the
same time, Kierkegaard used pseudonymy to give voice to all the d i ffere n t
characters within him. In the process, he objectified h i s various sel ves,

skillful questions, objecti fied the self of hii; intc1·locutor11 wit hout recol(n i z i n l(

himself i n any of them. Thus we find Kierkegaard writing: "Because o f my
melancholy, it was years before I was able to say 'thou' to � yself. Between
my melancholy and my 'thou,' there was a whole world of fantasy. I exhausted
it, in part, in my pseudonyms. " 26 Yet Kierkegaard was not content to mask
himself behind pseudonyms. His real mask was Socratic irony itself; it was
Socrates himself: "0 Socrates! Yours and mine are the same adventure! I am
alone. My only analogy is Socrates. My task is a Socratic task." 27
Kierkegaard termed this Socratic method his "method of indirect com­
munication." 28 We encounter it once again in Nietzsche, for whom it is the
method of the great educator: "An educator never says what he himself
thinks, but always only what he thinks of a thing in relation to the
requirements of those he educates. He must not be detected in this dissimu­
lation. " 29 This method is justified by the educator's transcendent mission :
"Every profound spirit needs a mask; better yet, around every profound spirit
a mask is continually growing, thanks to the constantly false - that is to say,
superficial - interpretation of his every word, step, and manifestation of
life." JO The mask of the Socratic Silenus served as the model for Nietzsche's
theory of the mask. As he wrote in the unpublished writings of the last period
of his life:
I believe that this was the magic of Socrates: he had one soul, and
another one in behind it, and behind it still another one. It was in the
first one that Xenophon lay down to sleep; in the second, Plato; and in
the third one Plato again, but this time Plato with his own second soul.
Plato himself is a man with many a hidden cave behind and facades out
front.31
As for Kierkegaard, so for Nietzsche: masks were a pedagogical necessity,
but also a psychological need. Nietzsche himself could be included in his
category of "men who want only to be seen shining through others. And
there's a lot of wisdom in this. " 32 In his Ecce Homo,-13 Nietzsche himself
admits that he used his masters Schopenhauer and Wagner as masks in
writing his Untimely Meditations, just as Plato had used Socrates as a
"semiotics." There is indeed a relationship comparable to that between Plato
and Socrates here: Nietzsche was speaking of an ideal Wagner and an ideal
Schopenhauer, who were really nothing other than Nietzsche himself. As
Bertram34 has convincingly shown, one of Nietzsche's masks was certainly
Soc rates himself; Socrates, whom he pursued with the same amorous hatred
that Nietzsche feels for Nietzsche; that same Socrates who, he tells us, "is so
close to me, that I am almost always fighting with him." 35 The side of
S oc mteH Nietzsche hates is identical with the Nietzsche who dissolves myths,
rcplndng the l(od11 by the knowledge of good a nd evil; the Nietzsche who

Socrates which Nietzsche loves, and of which he is jealous, is what he himself
would like to be: the seducer, the educator, and the guide of souls. We shall
have occasion to return to this amorous hatred.
The Socratic mask is the mask of irony. If we examine the texts - by Plato,36
Aristotle,37 or Theophrastus38 - in which the word eironeia appears, we can
conclude that irony is a psychological attitude in which the individual uses
self-deprecation in an attempt to appear inferior to what he really is. In the
art and usage of discourse, it takes the form of pretending to concede that
one's interlocutor is right, and to adopt the point of view of one's adversary.
The rhetorical figure of eironeia, then, consists in using words or speeches
which the audience would rather have expected to hear coming from the
mouth of one's adversary.39 This is certainly the form assumed by Socratic
irony. In the words of Cicero: "By disparaging himself, Socrates used to
concede more than was necessary to the adversaries he wanted to refute.
Thus, thinking one thing and saying another, he enjoyed using the kind of
dissimulation which the Greeks call 'irony'." 40 Socratic irony is thus a feigned
self-deprecation, which consists primarily in passing oneself off as someone
completely ordinary and superficial. As Alcibiades puts it in his praise of
Socrates:
His speech is for all the world like those Sileni that open up down the
to it for the first ti m e , you j ust can't h el p
finding it absolutely ridiculous. He talks about pack asses and black­
smiths and shoemakers and tanners, and he always seems to be repeating
the same thing, so that anyone who wasn't used to his style and wasn't
very quick on the uptake would naturally take it for the most utter
nonsense.4 1

middle. When you listen

Not only was Socrates guilty of banality in the subjects he discussed, but
his interlocutors were banal, as well. He sought out and found his audience
in the marketplace, the gymnasia, artists' workshops, and shops. He was a
street person. In the words of Nietzsche: "Mediocrity is the most appropriate
mask the superior spirit can wear. " 42 Socrates talked and debated, but he
refused to be considered a master. "When people came to sec him," remarks
Epictetus, "and asked him to introduce them to other philosophers, he
complied readily, and willingly accepted to pass unnoticed hi m s e l f. " 43
Here we touch the heart of Socratic irony: if Socrates refused to teach or
be considered a master, it was because he had nothing to say or to
communicate, for the excellent reason that, as he frequently proclaimed , he
did not know anything. Since he had nothing to say, and no thesis to defend ,
all Socrates could do was to ask questions, even thoul(h he himsel f r e fus ed to
answer th em . In the first book of the Rep u/Jlir, ThrR11ymRcll llt1 cries out : "Y c
gods! Herc w e have the well-known rirm1ri11 of Sorn1 1 l•111 "till I k nrw ii und

predicted that when it came to replying you would refuse and dissemble and
do anything rather than answer any question that anyo\le asked you." 44
Aristotle described the situation even more clearly: "Socrates used to ask
questions and not answer them - for he used to confess that he did not
know . " 45
Obviously, we cannot know exactly how Socrates' discussions with the
Athenians took place. Plato's dialogues - even the most "Socratic" - are only
a doubly weak imitation of them. In the first place, they are not spoken, but
written, and, as Hegel remarked,

"in

printed dialogue, answers are altogether

under the author's control; but to say that in actual life people are found to
answer as they arc here made to do, is quite another thing. " 46 Moreover,
beneath the surface charm of literary fiction, we can recognize in P lato's
dialogues the trace of the scholastic exercises of the Platonic Academy.
Aristotle codified the rules of these dialectical jousts in his

Topics.41 There

were

well-defined roles for both questioner and respondent in these argumentation
exercises, and the rules of this intellectual fencing were rigorously defined.
It is not our task here to try to disentangle what may be properly "Socratic"
in the conversations reported by Plato; rather, we arc concerned to uncover
the significance of Socratic i rony as it was known to trad ition, and the
movements of consciousness to which it corresponds.

Otto Apelt48 has given a good description of the mechanism of Socratic

irony: Spa/tung

und Verdoppelung.49

Socrates splits h imself into two, so that

there are two Socrates: the Socrates who knows in advance how the discussion
is going to end, and the Socrates who travels the entire dialectical path along
with his interlocutor. Socrates' interlocutors do not know where he is leading
them, and therein lies the irony. As he travels the path along with his
interlocutors, Socrates constantly demands total agreement from them . He
takes his partner's position as his starting point, and gradually makes him
admit all the consequences of his position . This a priori agreement is founded
on the rational demands of the Logos,50 or reasonable discourse. By constantly
demanding assent, Socrates leads his interlocutor to recognize that his initial
position was contradictory, and he thereby objectifies their common under­
taking. As a rule, Socrates chooses an activity familiar to his interlocutor as
the

subject of discussion,

and tries to define, together with him, the practical

knowledge required to carry out this activity. For example, a general must
know how to fight bravely, and a soothsayer must behave piously towards the

go<Js. A t the end of the road ,
of what cou rage really is, and

however, the general turns out to have no idea
the soothsayer docsn 't know what piety is.

It

is

t hen that the interlocutor rcali7..cs that he doesn't really know the reasons

Thus, the interlocutor, too, is cut in two: there is the interlocutor as he was
before his conversation with Socrates, and there is the interlocutor who, in the
course of their constant mutual accord, has identified himself with Socrates,
and who henceforth will never be the same again.
The absolutely essential point in this ironical method is the path which
Socrates and his interlocutor travel together. Socrates pretends he wants to
learn something from his interlocutor, and this constitutes his ironic self­
deprecation. In fact, however, even while Socrates appears ro identify himself
with the interlocutor, and enter completely into his· discourse, in the last
analysis it is the interlocutor who unconsciously enters into Socrates' dis­
course and identifies himself with him. Let us not forget: to identify oneself
with Socrates is to identify oneself with aporia and doubt, for Socrates doesn't
know anything; all he knows is that he knows nothing. Therefore, at the end
of the discussion, the interlocutor has not learned anything; in fact, he no
longer even knows anything. And yet, throughout the duration of the
discussion, he has experienced what true activity of the mind is. Better yet,
he has been Socrates himself. And Socrates is interrogation, questioning, and
stepping back to take a look at oneself; in a word, he is consciousness.
Such is the profound meaning of Socratic maieutics. In a famous passage
of the Theaetetus,51 Socrates tells how he practices the same trade as did his
mother, who was a midwife, attending corporeal births. Socrates himself, he
claims, is a midwife of the mind, and it is to the birth of minds that he
attends. Socrates himself does not engender anything, since he knows
nothing; he merely helps others to engender themselves. As Kierkegaard was
well aware, Socratic maieutics stands the master-disciple relationship on its
head:
to be a teacher does not mean simply to affirm that such a thing is so,
or to deliver a lecture, & etc. No, to be a teacher in the right sense is to
be a learner. Instruction begins when you, the teacher, learn from the
learner, put yourself in his place so that you may understand what he
understands and in the way he understands it. 52
The disciple is the opportunity for the master to understand himself, as
the master is the opportunity for the disciple to understand himself.
When he dies, the master has no claim on the disciple's soul, no more
than the disciple has on that of the master . . . The best way to
understand Socrates is precisely to understand that we do not owe him
anything. That is what Socrates preferred, and it is good that he was
able to prefer this. 53
Here we touch upon one of the p oss i b le rncnningN of Socratcfi' cnigmat k
declaration : " I o n l y k no w one t h ing: th111 iM, 1 h111 I llun'I know 11 n y 1 him(. " 1•

This statement could be interpreted as meaning that Socrates did not possess
any transmissible knowledge, and was unable to cause ideas to pass from his
mind into that of others. As Socrates is made to say in Plato's Symposium, "My
dear Agathon . I only wish that wisdom were the kind of thing that flowed
. . . from the vessel that was full to the one that was empty." 55
In Xenophon's Memoirs of Socrates, Hippias tells Socrates that, instead of
always asking questions about justice, he would do better simply to say, once
and for all, whar j ustice is. Socrates replies: "If I don't reveal my views on
justice in words, I do so by my conduct. " 56 To be sure, Socrates was a
passionate lover of words and dialogue. With j ust as much passion, however,
he sought to demonstrate to us the limits of language. What he wanted to
show us is that we can never understand justice if we do not live it. Justice,
like every authentic reality, is indefinable, and this is what Socrates sought to
make his interlocutor understand, in order to urge him to "live" justice. The
questioning of discourse leads to the questioning of the individual, who must
decide whether or not he will resolve to live according to his conscience and
to reason. In the words of one of Socrates' interlocutors: "Anyone who enters
into conversation with Socrates is liable to be drawn into an argument, and
whatever subject he may start, he will be continually carried round and round
by him, until at last he finds that he has to give an account both of his present
and past life. " 57 The individual thus finds himself called into question in the
most fundamental bases of his action, and he becomes aware of the living
problem he himself represents for himself. All values are consequently turned
upside down, as is the importance previously accorded them . As Socrates says
in Plato's Apology:
.

.

I care nothing for what most people care about: money-making,
administration of property, generalships, success in public debates,
magistracies, coalitions, and political factions . I did not choose that
path, but rather the one by which I could do the greatest good to each
of you in particular: by trying to persuade each of you to concern
himself less about what he has that about what he is, so that he may
make himself as good and as reasonable as possible. 58
.

.

The Socratic enterprise is existential in that it appeals to the individual.
This is why Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, each in his own way, tried to repeat
it .. In the following text by Nietzsche, where he describes the "Schopenhauer­
ian man," isolated in the midst of his contemporaries, it is hard not to think
of Socrates' constant appeal to "take care of yourself," 59 and his continual
calling into question of the individual:

their comedy and not at all of themselves. To the question: "To what
end do you live?" they would all quickly reply with pride: "To become
a good citizen, or scholar, or statesmanl " 60
the objective of all human arrangements is through distracting one's
thoughts to cease to be aware of life.61
Haste is universal because everyone is in flight from himself.62
Already in Plato's Symposium, Alcibiades had said: "Socrates makes me admit
to myself that, even though I myself am deficient in so many regards, I
continue to take no care for myself, but occupy myself with the business of
the Athenians." 113 This passage allows us to glimpse the political consequences
of such a reversal of values and upending of the guiding norms of life.
Concern for one's individual destiny cannot help but lead to conflict with
the state. 64 This is the deepest meaning of the trial and death of Socrates.
Socratic irony becomes especially dramatic when, thanks to the evidence of
Plato's Apology of Socrates, we sec it being used at the expense of the
philosopher's accusers, and, in a sense, bringing about his condemnation to
death.M
Here we have an instance of the "seriousness of existence" of which
Kierkegaard speaks."" For Kierkegaard, Socrates' merit was that he was an
exis1i11g thinker, not a speculative philosopher who has forgotten what it
means to exist. Kierkegaard's fundamental category of existence is the
individual, or the unique, isolated in the solitude of his existential respons­
ibility. For Kierkegaard, Socrates was its discoverer.1'7
Here we come upon one of the most profound reasons for Socratic irony:
direct language is not adequate for communicating the experience of existing,
the authentic consciousness of being, the seriousness of life as we live it, or
the solitude of decision making. To speak is to be doubly condemned to
banality. In the first place, there can be no direct communication of existential
experience, and in this sense, every speech-act is "banal." Secondly, however,
it is this same banality which, in the form of irony, can make indirect
communication possible.611 In the words of Nietzsche: "I believe I sense that
Socrates was profound; his irony was above all the necessity to pass himself
off as superficial, in order to be able to associate with people at all." 69 For the
existential thinker, banality and superficiality are a vital necessity. The
existentialist must remain in contact with mankind, even if the latter is at a
level of less-than-adequate consciousness. At the same time, however, we have
here to do with a pedagogical artifice. The circuitous detours of irony, and
the shock of aporit1, can cause the reader to attnin 10 the seriousness of
existential consciousness, especially if, 1ts we s h11l l 11cc l111c1", 1· h c p o we r of l•:ros
is thrown in for icood measure.

The Figure o/Socrates

Socrates had no system to teach. Throughout, his philosophy was a
spiritual exercise, an invitation to a new way of life, active reflection, and
living consciousness.
Perhaps the Socratic formula: "I know that I know nothing" ought to be
given a deeper meaning. We are thus brought back to our starting point:
Socrates knows that he is not a sage.70 As an individual, his conscience was
aroused and spurred on by this feeling of imperfection and incompleteness.
In this regard, Kierkegaard can help us to understand the significance of
the figure of Socrates. Kierkegaard asserts that he knows only one thing: that
he is not a Christian . He was intimately convinced of this fact, because to be
a Christian is to have a genuine personal and existential relationship with
Christ; it is to intcriorize Christ in a decision emanating from the depths of
the self. Since such interiorization is so very difficult, it is virtually impossible
for anyone truly to be a Christian. The only true Christian was Christ. At any
rate, the least we can say is that the best Christian is he who is aware of not
being a Christian, insofar as he recognizes that he is not a Christian.71
Like every existential consciousness, Kierkegaard's was divided. It existed
only in its consciousness of not truly existing. Kierkegaardian consciousness
is identical to Socratic consciousness:
0 Socrates, you had the accursed advantage of making it painfully

obvious, by means of your ignorance, that others were even less wise
than you. They didn't even know that they were ignorant. Your
adventure was the same as mine. People become exasperated with me
when they sec that I can show that others are even less Christian than
I; I who respect Christianity so much that I see and admit that I am not
a Christian!72

Socratic consciousness is also torn and divided: not by the figure of Christ,
but by the transcendent norm of the figure of the sage.
justice, as we have seen, cannot be defined . It must be lived . All the human
discourse in the world could never su ffice to express the depth of one person's
resolution to be just. All human decisions arc, howc �er, fragile and precarious.
When a person chooses to be just in the context of a particular act, he has the
inkling of an existence which could be just in the full sense of the term . Such
a fully j ust existence is that of the sage, who is not sop/10s, but philo-sophos: not
a wise man, but one who desires wisdom, precisely because he lacks it. Paul
Friedlander puts it well: "Socratic irony, at its center, expresses the tension
between ignorance - that is, the impossibility ultimately to put into words
'what justice is' - and the direct experience of the unknown, the existence of
the just man, whom justice raises to the level of the divine. " 73

being wise. An immense desire arises from such an awareness of privation,
and this is why, for Western consciousness, Socrates the philosopher takes on
the features of Eros, the eternal vagabond in search of true beauty.

2

Eros

It could be said that Socrates was the first individual in the history of Western
thought. Werner Jaeger,. was right to point out that Plato and Xenophon, in
their Socratic writings, strive to make the reader sense Socrates' originality
and uniqueness as they sketch his literary portrait. This need of theirs was
certainly the result of the extraordinary experience of having known an
incomparable personality, and, as Kierkegaard pointed out, 75 it is the true
explanation of the terms atopos, atopia, and atopotatos, which recur so often
in the Platonic corpus76 to describe Socrates' character. In the Theaetetus, for
instance, Socrates declares: "They say I am atopotatos, and all I create is
aporia." 77 Etymologically, atopos means "out of place," hence strange, extrava­
gant, absurd, unclassifiable, and disconcerting. In the Symposium, Alcibiades
insists on this point in his speech in praise of Socrates. Normally, he
says, there are classes of men, ideal types to which individuals correspond .
For example, there i s the type o f the "great general, noble and courageous,"
represented in Homeric antiquity by Achilles, and among contemporary
figures by the Spartan leader Brasidas. Then there is the type of the "clever
and eloquent statesman," represented in antiquity by Nestor the Greek and
Antenor the Trojan, and by Pericles among contemporaries. Socrates, how­
ever, docs not fit into any category. He cannot be compared to any man,
concludes Alcibiades; only to Sileni or satyrs.78
Socrates was indeed an individual : that individual so dear to Kierkegaard
that he would have liked to have as an epitaph: "He was That Individual. " 79
And yet, although Socrates was unlike anyone else, we shall now see him
take on the m y thic characteristics of Eros;80 an Eros, that is, conceived as a
projection of the figure of Socrates.
In Socrates, erotic irony is intimately connected to dialectical irony, and it
leads to reversals of situation quite analogous to those caused by the latter.
Let us be quite clear: the love in question here is homosexual love, precisely
because it is educative love. In the Greece of Socrates' day, masculine love
was a vestige and remainder of archaic warrior edU<."ll tion, in which the young
nobleman was trained in the aristocratic virtues, within the frame­
work of virile friendship, and under the direction of an older man . The
master-disciple relationship was conceived during the period of th e Sophists,
on the model of this archaic relationship, and ii waN freq uen t l y spoken of in
erotic terms. We must not, of co u rse , for1tct t lw rolt• t'l11 ycd hy rhetoric nnd

The Figure of Socrates

Socrates' erotic irony consisted in pretending to be in love until, thanks to
the reversal brought about by irony, the object of his amoreus attentions fell
in love himself. Such is the story Alcibiades tells in his speech in praise of
Socrates. Alcibiades, believing in the sincerity of the numerous declarations
of love Socrates had made to him, invited Socrates home one night in order
to seduce him. He slipped into bed with him, and wrapped his arms around
nim. Much to Alcibiades' surprise, however, Socrates remained in complete
control of himself, and did not let himself be seduced at all. "Since that time,''
declares Alcibiades,
I am the one who has been reduced to slavery, and I'm in the state of a
man bitten by a viper.82
I've been bitten in the heart, or the mind, or whatever you like to call
it, by Socrates' philosophy . . . the moment I hear him speak I am
smitten with a kind of sacred rage, worse than any Corybant, and my
heart jumps into my mouth and the tears start into my eyes . . . I'm not
the only one, either; there's Charmides, and Euthydemus, and ever so
many more. He's made fools of them all, just as if he were the beloved,
not the lover.83

·

It is hard to imagine a better commentary on this passage than the following
one, by Kierkegaard:
one might possibly call him a seducer, for he deceived the youth and
awakened longings which he never satisfied . . . He deceived them all in
the same way as he deceived Alcibiades who . . . observes that instead of
the lover, Socrates became the beloved . . . he attracted the youth to
him, hut when they looked up to him, when they sought repose in him,
when forgetting all else they sought a safe abode in his lov�, when they
themselves ceased to exist and lived only in being loved by him - then
he was gone, then the enchantment was over, then they felt the deep
pangs of unrequited love, felt that they had bee n deceived and that it
was not Socrates who loved them but they who loved Socrates.8•
Socrates' erotic irony consisted in pretending to be in love. In dialectic
irony, Socrates pretended, as he asked his questions, that his real desire was
that his interlocutor communicate to him his knowledge or wisdom. In fact,
however, this game of questions and answers resulted in the interlocutor
realizing that he was incapable of curing Socrates' ignorance, for he in fact
had neither wisdom nor knowledge to give to Socrates. What the interlocutor
renlly desired, 1 hen, wns to enrol in Socrates' school: the school of the
conHcim111m·NN 1 11' 11111 -know inl(.

1 60

In erotic irony, Socrates used amorous declarations to pretend that he
wanted his ostensible lover to hand over to him not his knowledge, but his
physical beauty. This situation is understandable: Socrates was not attractive,
whereas the young man was. In this case, however, the beloved - or
supposedly beloved - discovered through Socrates' attitude that he was
incapable of satisfying Socrates' love, because there was no true beauty within
him. Upon discovering his shortcomings, the beloved would then fall in love
with Socrates. It was not beauty with which the beloved fell in love - Socrates
did not have any - rather, he fell in love with the love which, according to
Socrates' definition in the Symposium,85 is desire for the beauty which all of
us lack. To be in love with Socrates, then, was to be in love with love.
This is precisely the meaning of the Symposium.86 The whole dialogue is
constructed so as to make the reader guess the identity between the figures of
Socrates and Eros. Plato depicts the guests taking turns, going from left to
right, giving speeches in praise of Eros. In succession, we hear Phaedrus and
Pausanias, then Eryximachus the doctor, Aristophanes the comic poet, and
finally the tragic poet Ariston. When Socrates' turn comes, he does not give
a straightforward speech in praise of love, for that would be contrary to his
method. Instead, he reports the conversation he had once had with Diotima,
a priestess from Mantinea, who told him the myth of the birth of Eros.
Theoretically, the dialogue would have ended here, were it not for Alcibiades'
sudden intrusion into the banquet room. Crowned with violets and ivy leaves
and rather drunk, Alcibiades submits to the rules of the banquet, but instead
of praising Eros, he gives a speech in praise of Socrates.
The identity between Socrates and Eros is underlined in several ways: not
only does the speech in praise of Socrates take its place in the series of
speeches already given in praise of Eros, but, in addition, there are many
significant features in common between the portrait of Eros, as sketched by
Diotima, and the portrait of Socrates given by Alcibiades.
On the day of Aphrodite's birth, recounts Diotima, the gods had a banquet.
Penia - that is, "Poverty" or "Privation" - came begging at the end of the
meal. There she espied Poros - "Means," "Expedient," or "Wealth" - drunk
on nectar and asleep in Zeus' garden. As a way out of her destitution, Penia
decided to have a child by Poros, so she lay with him while he slept, and
conceived Eros.
This account of the genealogy of Eros allows Diotima to give a description
of him so subtle that it can be interpreted on a variety of levels. In the first
place, following the exact words of the myth, we can recognize in Eros the
features of both his mother and his father. From his father's side, he gets his
clever, inventive mind (in Greek euporit1). From his mother, he inherits the
condition of a poverty-stricken beggar: t1p11rit1. Behind this d es t.T i p t ion , we can
d istinguish a quite pnrticulnr co ncc p 1 ion of love. W here111; 1he other guests had
described Eros in an idt.'l1 li:1.ctl w il y , Sm· 1·11 t l'll l'l'l'ou n l N hiN l'nnverHll t inn w i t h

Diotima in order t o introduce some realism i nto the vision o f love. Contrary
to what the other guests assume, says Socrates, it is not the case that love is
beautiful. If it were, it would no longer be love, for Eros is essentially desire,
and the only thing that can be desired is that which one does not have. Eros,
then, cannot be beautiful: as the son of Penia, he lacks beauty, but as the son
of Poros, he knows how to remedy his lack. Agathon has confused love with
its object, the beloved .
For Socrates, love is a lover. It is therefore not, as most people think, a god,
but only a daimon; a being intermediate between the human and the divine.
This is why there is something comic about Diotima's description of Eros.
In it, we can perceive the beggarly existence to which love can condemn us.
This is the familiar theme of "Militat omnis amans": 37 in which the lover
stands guard on his beloved's doorstep, or spends the night sleeping on the
ground. Eros is both beggar and soldier, but also inventor, sorcerer, magician,
and clever talker, for love makes him ingenious. For him, life is an
uninterrupted suite of discouragement and hope, need and satisfaction, which
succeed one another in accordance with the successes and defeats of his love.
This is Eros in his monstrous aspect - good-for-nothing, shameless,
obstinate, loud-mouthed and savage - whose misdeeds are depicted with such
relish in Greek poetry, right down to the Byzantine period.88
And yet, with astonishing skill, Plato makes the features of Socrates "the
philosopher" appear beneath the figure of Eros the hunter. Agathon may
think Eros is delicate and lovely, but Diotima asserts he is, in reality, always
poor, rough , dirty, and barefoot. In his speech in praise of Socrate.'>,
Alcibiades likewise portrays Socrates as barefoot, covered only by a coarse
coat which barely protects him from the winter cold .89 From the context of
the dialogue, we learn that Socrates has, exceptionally, taken a bath before
coming to the symposium.'111 The comic poets, too, had a good laugh at the
expense of Socrates' bare feet and old cloak.91
The figure of Socrates as Eros the beggar was subsequently taken up by the
Cynic philosophers, in particular Diogenes. Diogenes, who seems to have
designated himself as a "furious Socrates," used to go wandering with only
his cloak and knapsack, bereft of hearth and home:92 As Friedlander points
out,93 barefooted Eros also calls to mind primitive man, as he is depicted by
Plato in the Protagoras (32 l c5) and the Statesman (272a5).
We arc thus brought back to the figure of that purely natural being, Silenus,
with his primitive strength, more primal than culture and civilization. The fact
that this element enters into the complex portrait of Socrates/Eros is n ot a matter
of indifference. Rather, it corresponds perfectly to the reversal of values brought
about by Socratic L'Onsciousness. For the person concerned about his soul, what
is essent ia l is not 10 be found in appearance, dress, or comfort, but in freedom.
And yet, I >iol imn Hl rcs.o;es that Eros has inherited some features from his
fn l hcr: "lw Kl' I N 1 1·111ll1 for noble 1muls, for he is bol d , headstrong, and full of

1 62

Figures

endurance. He's a dangerous hunter, always plotting some trick; he lusts
after cleverness,"' is full of resources, and is always thinking up some scheme;
he's a terrible sorcerer, magician, and sophist." 95 We could very well be
listening to Strepsiades in Aristophanes' Clouds, describing what he wants
to become after his Socratic education: "audacious, glib, daring and head­
strong . . . never at a loss for words, a real fox." 96 In his speech prais­
ing Socrates, Alcibiades had called him an impudent Silenus,97 and
Agathon had bestowed upon Socrates the epithet of hybristes.98 For
Alcibiades, Socrates is a magician99 and a smooth talker, skilled in attracting
pretty boys. 1 00

Eros' toughness appears once again in the portrait which Alcibiades
sketches of Socrates on campaign with the army. He could, Alcibiades says,
put up with cold, hunger, and fear, and hold his wine as easily as he endured
long bouts of meditation. 1 61 During the retreat from Delion, Alcibiades tells
us, Socrates walked as calmly as if he were in the streets of Athens, where
Aristophanes describes h im as "holding his head high . . . rolling his eyes,
barefoot, looking solemn." 102 As we can see, this portrait of Socrates/Eros is
not very flattering; we are clearly smack in the midst of Platonic - if not
Socratic - irony. Nevertheless, this image is not without its profound
psychological truth.
Eros, Diotima tells us, is a daimon: that is, a being intermediate between
gods and men. Once more, we are forced to consider the problem of
intermediary states, and we realize once more just how uncomfortable such a
situation is. Eros the daimon, as Diotima describes him to us, is undefinable
and unclassifiable: he too, like Socrates, is alopos. He is neither god nor man,
fair nor ugly, wise nor foolish, good nor evil. 103 Yet he still embodies desire,
for, like Socrates, he is aware that he is neither handsome nor wise. This is
why he is a philo-sopher - a lover of wisdom. In other words, he desires to
attain to the level of being of divine perfection. Thus, according to Diotima's
description, Eros is the desire for his own perfection, which is to say, for his
true self. He suffers from being deprived of the plenitude of being, and he
strives to attain it. When other men fall in love with Socrates/Eros - that is,
when they fall in love with love, such as Socrates reveals it to them - what
they love in Socrates is his love for, and aspiration toward, beauty and the
perfection of being. In Socrates, they find the path toward their own
perfection.
Eros, like Socrates, is merely a call and a possibility; he is neither wisdom
nor beauty itself. To be sure, if one opens up the little Sileni mentioned by
Alcibiades, they turn out to be full of statues of gods. 104 The Sileni, however,
are not themselves the statues. They only open up so that one can get at them .
The etymological meaning of Poros, Erm;' father, is " m ea n s of access" or
"way out . " Socrat·es is o n l y n SilenuK, opcn i n ic up onto somet h i n g beyond
h i msel f.

The Figure of Socrates

1 63

The philosopher, too, is nothing other than this: a summons to existence.
As Socrates puts it ironically to the handsome Alcibiades: "If you love me, it
must be because you have seen in me a beauty which bears no resemblance
to your own physical beauty . . . But consider the matter more carefully, lest
you make a mistake both about me and about me and about my real
,,
nothingness. 1 05 Here Socrates gives Alcibiades a warning. In loving Socrates,
he is really only loving Eros: not Aphrodite's son, but the son of Poros and
Penia. The cause of his love is that he senses that Socrates can open up to

him a path toward an extraordinary beauty, transcending all earthly beauties.
Socrates• virtues - those statues of the gods hidden within the ironical Silenus
- which Alcibiades admires so much, 106 are only a reflection and a foretaste of
that perfect wisdom which Socrates desires, and which Alcibiades desires
through Socrates.
In Socratic Eros, we find the same basic structure as in Socratic irony: a
divided consciousness, passionately aware that it is not what it ought to be. It
is from this feeling of separation and lack that love is born .
One of Plato's greatest merits will always be that he was able, via the myth
of Socrates/Eros, to introduce into the philosophical life the dimension of
love - that is, of desire and the irrational. He accomplished this in several
ways: in the first place, in the experience of dialogue itself, in which two
interlocutors experience a passionate will to clarify a problem together. Qµite
apart from the dialectical movement of the logos, the path traveled together
by Socrates and his partner, and their common will to come to an agreement,
arc already a kind of love. There is a great deal more philosophy in spiritual
exercises like Socrates' dialogues than in the construction of a philosophical
system . The task of dialogue consists essentially in pointing out the limits of
language, and its inability to communicate moral and existential experience.
Yet the dialogue itself, qua event and spiritual activity, already constitutes a
moral and existential experience, for Socratic philosophy is not the solit­
ary elaboration of a system, but the awakening of consciousness, and accession
to a level of being which can only be reached in a person-to-person
relationship.
Just like ironical Socrates, Eros teaches nothing, for he is ignorant. He does
not make people more wise; he makes them other. He, too, is maieutic: he
helps souls to engender themselves.
It is touching to trace the influence of Socratic Eros throughout his­
tory. 107 In third-century Alexandria, for instance, the Christian
writer Gregory Thaumaturgus praised his master Origen in the following
terms:
And thus, like some spark lighting upon our inmost soul, love was
within us - a love at once for the Logos . .

approach us in the genuine Socratic fashion, and trip us up by his
argumentation whenever he saw us getting restive under him, like so
many unbroken horses.108
As Bertram has shown in some splendid pages, 1 09 we encounter the tradition
of Socratic Eros and the educative daimon in Nietzsche. According to
Bertram, three sayings sum up perfectly this erotic dimension of pedagogy.
One is by Nietzsche himself: "The deepest insights spring from love alone." 1 1 0
Another is by Goethe: "We learn only from those we love. " 1 1 1 Finally, there
is Holderlin's dictum: "Mortal man gives his best when he loves." 1 1 2 These
three maxims go to show that it is only through reciprocal love that we can
accede to genuine consciousness.
Using Goethe's terminology, we could characterize this dimension of love,
desire, and the irrational as the "demonic." Plato had encountered this
dimension in the person of Socrates himself. As is well known, Socrates'
daimon was a kind of inspiration which sometimes . came over him in a
completely irrational way, as a negative sign telling him not to do such and
such a thing. It was, in a sense, his real "character," or true self. Moreover,
this irrational element in Socratic consciousness is probably not without
relation to Socratic irony. It is possible that Socrates' reason for asserting that
he did not know anything was that, when it came time for action, he trusted
in his own daimon, as he also trusted in the daimon of his interlocutors. In any
case, as James Hillman pointed out in 1 966, if Plato was able to bestow upon
Socrates the figure of the great daimon Eros, it was probably because, in
Socrates, he had encountered a demonic man . ' 13
How can we describe this dimension of the demonic? No one could be a
better guide for us in this matter than Goethe, who was fascinated and
troubled by the mystery of the "demonic" all throughout his life. His first
encounter with the demonic had probably been Socrates' daimon, as depicted
in Hamann's Socratic Memorabilia. 1 14 Socrates fascinated Goethe to such an
extent that we find the following extraordinary exclamation in his letter to
Herder of 1 772: "If only I could be Alcibiades for one day and one night, and
then die!" 115 For Goethe, the demonic had all the ambiguous and ambivalent
features of Socratic Eros. It is, as he writes in Book 20 of Poetry and Truth, 1 1 6
a force which is neither divine nor human, neither diabolical nor angelic,
which simultaneously unites and separates all beings. Just as in the case of
Eros in the Symposium, it can only be defined by simultaneous and contradic­
tory negations. Yet it is a force which gives its holders an incredible power
over beings and things. The demonic represents a k ind of natural magic
within the dimension of the irrational and inex plicable. Th i s irrational
element is the motor force indispensable for 1111 cre11tion; it is the bl i n d ,
inexorable dynamic which we cannot cscllpl', but muNt r1 Hhcr lc11rn how to
u11e. In hi11 l lm•111·11•, Goet hl' wri tc!i 1111 follm\'N 11ho11 t t ill' "'""'"" of i n d i v idunlN:

So must you be; you cannot escape yourself.
. . . no time nor power may destroy
Form marked with a seal, which develops as it lives. 1 1 7
In Goethe, the creatures who most faithfully represent this demonic element
take on the features of Eros in the Symposium. As Raabe has demonstrated,
this is particularly true in the case of Mignon. 1 1 8 Mignon, like Eros, is
indigent, but she aspires to purity and beauty. Although her clothing is poor
and coarse, her musical gifts reveal her inner riches. Like Eros, she sleeps on
the bare ground, or on Wilhelm Meister's doorstep. Finally, like Eros, she is
the projection and incarnation of Wilhelm Meister's nostalgia for a higher
form of life.
Another demonic figure in Goethe is Ottilia, heroine of the Elective Affinities.
She is depicted as a natural force, powerful, strange, and fascinating. Her
profound relationship to Eros is more discreetly indicated than in the case of
Mignon, but it is no less real. Mention should also be made of the
hermaphroditic figure of Homunculus, whose relationship to Eros is emphas­
ized so clearly in Act II of the Second Fausl . 1 19
As an ambiguous, ambivalent, indecisive element, the demonic is neither
good nor evil. Only mankind's moral decision can give it its definitive value.
And yet, this irrational, inexplicable element is inseparable from existence.
The encounter with the demonic, and the dangerous game with Eros, cannot
be avoided .

3 Dionysos

We shall now return to Nietzsche's odd, amorous hatred for Socrates. To be
sure, Bertram has already stated the essential on this point, 1 20 but perhaps
Nietzsche's complex attitude can be better understood by considering some
of the less frequently noticed elements which go to make up 'the Socrates of
the Symposium.
Nietzsche was quite familiar with the strange seductive powers of Socrates,
whom he termed "This mocking and enamored monster and pied piper of
Athens, who made the most overweening youths tremble and sob . " 1 2 1 Nietz­
sche tries to define the mechanism of this seduction: "I have made under­
standable how it was that Socrates could repel : it is therefore all the more
necessary to explain his fascination." 122 N ietzsche then goes on to propose
several explanations: Socrates flattered the Greeks' taste for combat with his
dialectics; he was a great erotic; he understood his historical role of counter­
acting instinctive decadence by means of rationality. The truth is that none of
these expl11nnt ion11 iN particularly fascinating. Nietzsche does, however, suggest
11 more 1m1fouml t•11 uNe: the 11eduction Socrates exercised on all posterity came

1 66

Figures

from his attitude in the face of death. More specifically, it came from the
semi-voluntary nature of his death. As early as his first work, The Birth of
Tragedy, Nietzsche summed up the last pages of the Phaedo and the
Symposium in a grandiose image:
that he was sentenced to death, not exile, Socrates himself seems to have
brought about with perfect awareness and without any natural awe of
death. He went to his death with the calm with which, according to
Plato's description, he leaves the Symposium at dawn, the last of the
revelers, to begin a new day, while on the benches and on the ground
his drowsy table companions remain behind to dream of Socrates, the
true Eroticist. The dying Socrates becomes the new ideal, never seen
before, of noble Greek youths. m
Nietzsche sensed and foresaw, in the concluding scene of Plato's Sympo­
sium, a symbol of Socrates' death. Taken by itself, Plato's description of the
scene was as simple as could be:
Only Agathon, Aristophanes and Socrates were still awake, and they
were passing a huge bowl from left to right, and drinking from it.
Socrates was holding a discussion with them . . . he was gradually
forcing them to admit that one and the same author ought to be able to
compose both comic and tragic poetry . . . Aristophanes was the first to
fall asleep, and then, when the sun had already risen, Agathon. Socrates
. . . then got up and left. He headed for the Lyceum, and, after splashing
himself with water, he spent the rest of the day just like he would have
any other. m
The ambiguous symbolism latent in this sober passage has not been lost on
modern poets. C.F. Meyer, for instance, gave the following picture of the
figure of the dying Socrates, in that dawn when only the philosopher is still
awake:

While Socrates' friends drank with him
And their heads sank down on their pillows
A young man came in I remember it well
Along with two lithe flute-players.
We drained our cups to the dregs,
And our lips, tired from so much talk, fell silent
A song hovered above the withered garlands , ,
Silence! The Nlccpy fl utes of dcnth nre Nmmd inl(l 1 1 '
-

.

The Figure of Socrates

By contrast, what Holderlin saw in this episode was Socrates the lover of life:
Yet each of us has his measure.
For hard to bear
Is misfortune, but harder still good fortune.
Yet one wise man was able
From noon to midnight, and on
Till morning lit up the sky
To keep wide awake at the banquet . 126
Herein lies the enigma Socrates posed for Nietzsche. How could someone
who loved life as much as Socrates loved it seem, by his will to die, to hate
existence? For Nietzsche was quite familiar with the Socrates who loved life;
indeed, he loved him:
If all goes well, the time will come when one will take up the
Memorabiliam of Socrates rather than the Bible as a guide to morals and
reason, and when Montaigne and Horace will be employed as forerunners
and signposts to an understanding of Socrates, that simplest and most
imperishable of intercessors. The pathways of the most various philosoph­
ical modes of life lead back to him . . . Socrates excels the founder of
Christianity in possessing a joyful kind of seriousness and that wisdom full
of roguishness that constitutes the finest state of the human soul. 1 28
W e can see Socrates' "wisdom full of roguishness" i n Xenophon's depiction of

Socrates dancing; 129 in the jesting, ironical Socrates of the Platonic dialogues;
and in the figure of the life-loving philosopher in Holderlin's poem "Socrates
and Alkibiades":
"Holy Socrates, why do you always
Pay court to this young man?
Do you know nothing greater?
Why do your eyes gaze lovingly· on him
As on a god?"
"He who has thought most deeply
Loves that which is the most alive.
He who has seen the world
Can understand lofty Youth.
And often, in the end,
The wise bow down before the fair."1.10

extraordinary passage, Nietzsche has recourse to Holderlin's verses in order
to describe the sage's gaiety:
Nothing better or happier can befall a man than to be in the proximity

they have thought
most deeply, must love what is most living and, as sages, incline in the end to
the beautiful . . They are active and truly alive . . . which is why, in their

.

proximity, we feel human and natural for once, and feel like exclaiming
with Goethe: "How glorious and precious is a living thing! how well

adapted to the conditions it lives in, how true, how existent! " 1 3 1
In

The Birth of Tragedy,132

Nietzsche thought he could foresee the coming

of a musical Socrates. Socrates the musician, he thought, would answer the
call which, in Socrates' dreams, had invited the philosopher to devote himself
to music; he would thereby reconcile the ironic lucidity of rational conscious­
ness with demonic enthusiasm. S uch a figure, says Nietzsche in his unpub­
lished writings, would be a true example of "tragic man . " N ietzsche projected
his own dream of a reconciliation between Apollo and Dionysos into this
image of Socrates as musician.
In the dying Socrates, Nietzsche saw yet another reflection of his own
drama. Socrates

wa111ed

to die - this is what was so shocking to Nietzsche -

and at the moment of his death his spoke these enigmatic words: "0 Crito,
we owe a rooster to Asclepius. " 1 33 It was as if he had been cured from some
illness, and owed a debt to the god of healing.
This ridiculous and terrible "last word" means, for those who have ears:

"0 Crito, life is a disease." Is it possible that a man like him . . . should
have been a pessimist? He had merely kept a cheerful mien while
concealing all his life long his u ltimate judgment, his inmost feeling.
Socrates, Socrates

suffered life! And then he still

revenged himsel f - with

this veiled, gruesome, pious, and blasphemous saying . . . I wish he had
remained taciturn also at the last moment of his life; in that case he
might have belonged to a still higher order of spirits. 1 34
As Bertram has shown so well, Nietzsche here gives us the clue to his own secret,
intimate doubt, and to the drama of his entire existence. Nietzsche would have
liked to be the bard of the joy of life and existence; yet, in the final analysis,

wasn't he, too, afraid that life might be nothing but a disease? By letting what he

thought of terrestrial existence be known, Socrates gave his secret a way . Yet

In the Twilight of the Idols, we find one final reversal in N ietzsche's
reinterpretation of Socrates' last words. Here, the sick�ess from which
Socrates is to be cured is not life itself, but the kind of life Socrates led:
" 'Socrates is no physician,' he said softly to himself; 'here death alone is the
physician. Socrates himself has merely been sick for a long time. ' " 136 On this
interpretation, Socratic lucidity and Socratic morality correspond to a sickness
gnawing away at life. Yet, here again, might not Socrates' illness be the same
as that of Nietzsche himself? This myth-dissolving lucidity, this pitiless
consciousness; are they not those of Nietzsche himself? Nietzsche's amorous
hatred for Socrates was, in the last analysis, identical with the amorous hatred
Nietzsche felt for himself. Perhaps the ambiguity of the figure of Socrates in
Nietzsche was rooted in the ambiguity of the central figure of N ietzschean
mythology: Dionysos, god of death and of life.
For reasons which, in the last analysis, remain rather mysterious for us,
Plato in his Symposium surrounded Socrates with a whole cluster of Dionysiac
symbols. 137 In fact, the entire dialogue could have been entitled The Judgment
of Dionysos, since Agathon tells Socrates that, when it comes to finding out
who is wiser, he or Socrates, they will leave the question up to Dionysos. In
other words, whoever drinks the most will win this contest of sophia - wisdom
and knowledge - placed as it is under the sign of the god of wine. m When
Alcibiades later bursts into the banquet room, he is crowned with violets and
ivy leaves, just like Dionysos. 1 39 As soon as he comes in, Alcibiades places a
crown of headbands around Socrates' head, as it was the custom to do for the
victor in poetry contests. 1 40 We recall that Dionysos was the god both of
tragedy and of comedy. In the course of his speech in praise of Socrates,
Alcibiades composes what Socrates later terms "a drama of satyrs and
Sileni,'' 14 1 since these are the beings to which he compares Socrates. Again,
we recall that satyrs and Sileni formed the accompanying entourage of
Dionysos, and that the centre of satyric drama was, originally, the passion
of Dionysos. In the final scene of the Symposium, we find Socrates alone with
the tragic poet Agathon and the comic poet Aristophanes, gradually convinc­
ing them that one and the same man should be able to be both a tragic
and a comic poet. 142 Agathon, in his praise of Eros, ·had said that love was the
greatest of poets. 143 Thus, Socrates, who excels in the field of Eros, also
excels in that of Dionysos. After all, he has no rival when it comes to holding
his wine, 1 44 and if, as a result of the "Judgment of Dionysos," he wins the
wisdom contest, it is because he is the only one still awake at the end of the
banquet. 145 Can we discern yet another Dionysiac characteristic in his
prolonged ecstasies and transports, which are mentioned twice in the dia­
logue? 1 41,
Thus, we find in Plato's Symposium what seems to be a conscious and
dclihcrntc e nsemble of nllusions to the Dionysiac nature of the figure of
Socnl l c N . Thi11 l'l1Nl'lllhk c u l m i n a tes in t h e final scene of the dialogue, i n

Figures

which Socrates emerges victorious from the judgment of Dionysos, as the best
drinker and the best poet.
We should not be surprised if, paradoxically, secretly, and

perhaps

unconsciously, the figure of Socrates comes, for Nietzsche, to coincide with
the figure of Dionysos.
At the end of

Beyond Good and Evil,

Nietzsche dedicates to Dionysos an

extraordinary panegyric of the "genius of the heart," which he repeats, as
evidence of his skill in psychological mastery, in the

Ecce Homo,'41

although

this time he makes a point of refusing to say whom he is addressing. In this
hymn, it is as though we hear an echo of the

Veni Sa ncte Spiritus,H8

that old

medieval encomium of the Holy Ghost (of which Hamann149 considered
Socrates'

daimon

to be a prefiguration): "Flecte quod est rigidum, fove quod

est frigidum, rege quod est devium. " 1 5° For Nietzsche, the genius of the heart
has the same marvelously delicate power of softening, warming, and straighten­
ing. In his portrait of the spiritual guide with demonic powers, Nietzsche
intended to describe the action of Socrates. But as Bertram has suggested,151
wasn' t he also thinking - consciously or unconsciously - of Socrates?
We will conclude with Nietzsche's encomium, since it sums up admirably
all the themes of our discussion :
The genius of the heart, as that great concealed one possesses it, the
tempter god and born pied piper of consciences, whose voice knows how
to descend into the netherworld of every soul; who docs not say a word or
cast a glance in which there lies no secret goal of seduction . . . the genius

of the heart who silences all that is loud and self-satisfied, teaching it to
listen; who smooths rough souls and lets them taste a new desire - to lie
still as a mirror, that the deep sky may mirror itself in them . . . the genius
of the heart from whose touch everyone walks away richer, not having
received grace and surprised, not as blessed and oppressed by alien goods,
but richer in himself, newer to himself than before, broken open and
sounded out by a thawing wind; more uncertain, perhaps; tenderer, more
fragile, more broken, but full of hopes that as yet have no name.152

Marcus Aurelius

1

The Meditations as a Spiritual Exercise

The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius - a better translation of the Greek

title would be Exhortalions lo Himself were first published in the West by
the Zurich humanist Andreas Gesner, in 1 558-9. Since their first appearance,
the Meditations have continued to fascinate readers. Not all of these
readers, however - and this includes many historians as well - have
always understood what Marcus Aurelius intended to accomplish by writ­
ing this book. The seventeenth-century English editors and translators
Meric Casaubon and Thomas Gataker still had an intimate sense for ancient
realities, and were well aware of the nature of the work with which they were
dealing. The Meditat ions, they realized, were a collection of hypomnemata
(commentaria in Latin): notes written on a daily basis for the author's personal
use.
Many authors allude to the existence of this literary genre in antiquity.
Since they were not intended for publication, however, such writings were
destined to disappear. We owe the preservation of Marcus' Meditations to
some happy set of circumstances, quite possibly to the piety of one of the
members of the emperor's immediate entourage.
Most historians, however, have anachronistically projected the literary
prejudices of their own epoch back upon the Meditations. In the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, when systematic treatises were considered the
perfect form of philosophical production, it was generally thought that the
Meditations should be brought into relation with the composition of some
such treatise. Scholars consequently imagined that the Meditations were the
extracts or disjecta membra of such a hypothetical opus, or perhaps a series of
notes written with a view to its publication.
In the nineteenth century, characterized as it was by romanticism, it was
widely rccogn i:r.ed that the Meditations were a collection of hypomnemata or
per1mnul notc11. Frrquen t l y , however, as in Renan's great study Marcm

Aurelius or the End of the Ancient World, 1 it was maintained that Marcus had
written "a personal diary of his inner states. "
I n the twentieth century, the age o f psychology, psychoanalysis, and
suspicion, the very fact of having written this personal diary has been
interpreted as the symptom of a psychological malaise. It has become a clichC
to speak of the "pessimism" of Marcus Aurelius. E. R. Dodds,2 for example,
insisted on the perpetual self-criticism which Marcus carried out upon
himself, and related this tendency to a dream of Ma rc u s ' , w h ic h i s p reserved
for us by Dio Cassius.3 On the night of his adoption, says Dio, the emperor
dreamed that his shoulders were made of ivory. According to Dodds,� this
suggests that Marcus suffered from an acute identity crisis.
In a collaborative s t u dy, H. van Effentcrre and the ps ych osomat i s t R. Dailly
undertook to diagnose t h e p athol ogical aspects - both psychic and ph ysi o l o­
gical - of w ha t th ey termed "the case of Marcus Aurelius. " ; Basing
themselves on the testimony of Dio Cass iu s ,6 th ey supposed t ha t Marcus
suffered from a ga s tri c ulcer, and that the emperor's pe rson al i t y corresponded
to the psychological correlates of this i l lness:

The ulcer-sufferer is someone closed in on himself, worried, and uneasy
. . . a kind of hypertrophy of the self renders him unable to see his fellow
men . . . in the last analysis, it is hi mse l f that he is looking for in others
. . . He is conscientious to the point of punctiliousness, and is more
interested in the technical perfection of administration than in human
re la t ion sh i p s , a lt h ou gh the former should be only the sum total of the
latter. If h e is a thinking man, the u lce r-s u ffe re r will be inclined to
search for justifications, to fabricate superior personalities, and to adopt
S to i c or P h a risa ic a t t it u des. 7
For t h e se authors, Marcus' Meditalions arc a res po n se to his need for
"self-persuasion" and "justification in his own e yes . " H
The acme of this kind of i n terpre ta ti on is no doubt the article by Thomas
W. Africa, entitled "The opium addiction of Marcus Aurelius." 9 Basing
himself on passages in Galen and Dio Cassius, the author tries to detect a
ge n u i n e addiction to opium on the part of Marcus Aurelius, and he b eli e ves
he can discover its symptoms in the Meditations. In fact, h ow ever , the texts
he cites do not constitute conclusive p roo f of M arcus ' drug ad d ic ti on . As for
t h e texts from t he Meditations themse l ves cited as symptoms of into xi cation ,
Africa's i n terp reta tion of th e m is pure nonsense.
Dio Cassius does not mention opium at al l ; he only mentions that, during
th e Danubian campaign, Marcus did not eat at ni ght , and during the day
consumed onl y a bit of theriac to e a se his chest a n d stomach . ID Galen docs
indeed mention opium, 1 1 but in such a way t hnt it is impossible to ded uce
from h i s words a ge n u i n e addict ion to opi u m . I le merel y 11nys thn t , d u ring

the Danubian campaign, Marcus took a little bit of theriac every day - "in
the quantity of an Egyptian bean" - for reasons of security. This was a
frequent custom among Roman emperors, since theriac was considered an
excellent antidote against poisons. Because theriac contained poppy-juice that is, opium - Marcus experienced chronic fatigue during the day when he
took it. He therefore had the poppy-juice removed from the mixture, but then
began to suffer from insomnia. He again returned to taking theriac with
poppy-j uice, but this time the thcriac was aged and much less strong. After
the death of Marcus' official doctor Demetrius, Galen himself was charged
with the composition of the emperor's theriac, and Marcus was entirely
satisfied with his services. Galen explained to him that his theriac was the
best, precisely because it was composed according to traditional proportions.
Marcus' problems with fatigue and insomnia were, as we can sec, merely
temporary. Marcus never sought out opium for its own sake, but for its
medicinal effects, and thanks to Galen he seems to have found the proper
balance in his dosage.
In the last note to his article, Africa himself admits that, even if one
consumed as much thcriac as Marcus did, the quantity of opium it contained
was, in all probability, insufficient to produce an opium addiction. But, he
adds, we must suppose that the prescribed doses were not always respected,
because we must find some way of explaining the strangeness of the emperor's
Meditations and the bizarre nature of the visions he describes.
Here the weakness of Africa's reasoning leaps to the eyes. We are not at all
certain, he argues, that Marcus Aurelius was an opium addict, but we have
to presume that he was, since we have somehow to explain the strangeness of
the Medittttions. This is a double sophism: first, even if Marcus' visions in the
Meditations are bizarre, nothing obliges us to explain them by means of
opium; after all, Dailly and van Effenterre were content to explain them by a
gastric ulcer!
Africa thinks he can detect analogies between the Meditations and Thomas
De Quincey's Confessions of an English Opium-eater. But is such a comparison
really possible?
We shall let Africa speak for himself: 12
Marcus' vision of time as a raging river carrying all before it into the
abyss of the future was no school doctrine of life viewed from the Porch
but an attempt to express the extended perspectives of time and space
which opium had opened up to him. Temporal and spatial dimensions
were accelerated until Europe was but a speck and the present a point
and men insects crawling on a clod. History was no longer a reference
hut an actual pageant of the past and Marcus shared the exacerbated
scns;UionN of h i s follow-add ict, De Quincey: "The sense of space, and
in the eml t ill' sense of time, were both powerfully affected . Buildings,

1 82

Figures

landscapes, etc., were exhibited in proportions so vast as the bodily eye is
not fitted to receive. Space swelled and was amplified to the extent of
unutterable and self-repeating infinity. This disturbed me very much less
than the vast expansion of time. Sometimes I seemed to have lived for
seventy or a hundred years in one night; nay, sometimes had feelings
representative of a duration far beyond the limits of human experience." 13
The passages from Marcus Aurelius to which Africa refers are the following:
Eternity is a kind of river of events, and a violent torrent; no sooner has
each thing been seen, than it has been carried away; another is being
carried along, and it too will be swept away. 14
Think often of the speed with which all that is and comes to be passes
away and vanishes; for Being is like a river in perpetual flux, its activities
are in constant transformation, and its causes in myriad varieties.

Scarcely anything is stable, even that which is close at hand. Dwell, too,
on the infinite gulf of the past and the future, in which all things vanish
away.15
Pace Mr Africa, this theme is abundantly attested in Stoicism. Talce, for
example, the following passages from Seneca:

Place before your mind's eye the vast spread of time's abyss and
embrace the universe; and then compare what we call human life with
infinity . . . r n
Everything falls into the same abyss . . . time passes infinitely quickly . . .
Our existence is a point; nay, even less; but nature, by dividing this
puny thing, has given it the appearance of a longer duration. 17
This image is a venerable one; we find it in the following fine verses of
Leonidas of Tarentum: "0 man, infinite was the time before you came to the
dawn, and infinite will be the time awaiting you in Hades. What portion of
life remains for you, but that of a point, or if there is anything tinier than a
point?" 1 8 To be sure, Marcus' river is none other than the Stoic river of
being, which "flows without ceasing," 19 but in the last analysis, it is also the
river of Heraclitus, who, Plato tells us, compared all beings to a river's flow.20
It is also, moreover, the river of the Platonists as mentioned by Plutarch: "All
things simultaneously come to be and perish : actions, words, and feelings for Time like a river carries everything away." 2 1 The same river is mentioned
by Ovid : "Time itself flows on in constant mot i on , just l i ke a river . . . wave
is p u s h ed on by wavc." 21

Marcus Aurelius

1 83

When, in the passage quoted above, Seneca uses the expression propone
"place before your mind's eye'', that is, "represent to yourself the abyss of
time" - he makes it clear that he is talking about an exercise of the
imagination which the S toic must practice. It is an instance of the same kind
of exercise when, in his Meditations, Marcus Aurelius tries to embrace the
dimensions of the universe in his imagination, and to look at things from on
high, 2l in order to reduce them to their true value.
-

Think of the whole of being, in which you participate to only a tiny
degree; think of the whole of eternity, of which a brief, tiny portion has
been assigned to you; think about fate, of which you are such an
insignificant part. 24
If you were to find yourself suddenly raised up into the air, and
observed from on high the busy hodgepodge of human affairs, you
would despise them, as you saw at the same time how vast is the domain

of the beings inhabiting the air and the ether.25
You have the power to strip off many superfluous things that are
obstacles to you, and that depend entirely upon your value-judgements;
you will open up for yourself a vast space by embracing the whole
universe in your thoughts, by considering unending eternity, and by
reflecting on the rapid changes of each particular thing; think of how
short is the span between birth and dissolution, and how vast the chasm
of time before your birth, and how the span after your dissolution will
likewise be infinite.26
The rational soul . . . travels through the whole universe and the void
that surrounds it . . . it reaches out into the boundless extent of infinity,
and it examines and contemplates the periodic rebirth of all things. 27
Asia and Europe arc little corners of the world; every sea is a droplet in
the world; each present instant of time is a point in eternity; everything
is puny, unstable, and vanishing.28
How puny a portion of infmite, gaping eternity has been assigned to each
man; it vanishes with all speed into the Unending. How puny a portion
of the substance of the All; how puny a portion of the soul of the All. Of
the whole of the earth , how puny is the lump you are crawling on!29

of his impressions. For Marcus, by contrast, the consideration of the infinity
of time and space is an active process; this is made quite clear by his repeated
admonitions to "represent to himself" and "think of" the totality of things.
We have to do here with a traditional spiritual exercise which utilizes the
faculties of the imagination. De Quincey speaks of a distortion of the instant,
which takes on monstrous proportions. Marcus, by contrast, speaks of an
effort to imagine the infinite and the all, in order that all instants and places
may be seen reduced to infinitesimal proportions. In Marcus' case, this
voluntary exercise of the imagination presupposes a belief in the classical Stoic
cosmological scheme: the universe is situated within an infinite void, and its
duration is comprised within an infinite time, in which periodic rebirths of
the cosmos are infinitely repeated. Marcus' exercise is intended to provide
him with a vision of human affairs capable of replacing them within the
perspective of universal nature.
Such a procedure is the very essence of philosophy. We find it repeated in identical form, beneath superficial differences of vocabulary - in all the
philosophical schools of antiquity.30 Plato, for instance, defines the philosoph­
ical nature by its ability to contemplate the totality of time and being, and
consequently to hold human affairs in contempt.31 We encounter this same
theme32 among Platonists like Philo of Alexandria·13 and Maximus of Tyre;34
in Neopythagoreanism35 among the Stoics,36 and even among the Epicureans,
as we have seen in the passage from Metrodorus quoted above. 37
In Cicero's Dream of Scipio, the grandson of Scipio Africanus contemplates
the earth from on top of the Milky Way. The earth appears so small to him
that the Roman empire seems imperceptible, the inhabited world resembles a
tiny island in the midst of the ocean, and life itself seems less substantial than
a point.38 This theme was kept alive throughout Western tradition. One thinks
of Pascal's "two infinities": "Let the earth seem like a point . . . compared to
the vast orbit described by this star . . . " 39
Marcus Aurelius' notes to himself give us very little information about his
personal experiences. To be sure, in some chapters of the Meditations we can
discern some minimal autobiographical data, but these are few and far
between (only 35-40 chapters, out of 473, contain such information). Often,
these details consist in no more than a name, such as Pantheia, mistress of
Lucius Verus, who sat next to her lover's tomb, or the mimes Philistion,
Phoibos, and Origanion. Marcus tells us practically nothing about himself.
But what about those numerous statements by Marcus which seem steeped
in pessimism? Don't they tell us anything about his psychological states? If
one gathers them together, they certainly give the impression of a complete
disdain for human affairs. We seem to find in them the expression of
bitterness, disgust, and even "nausea" 40 in the face of hum an existence: "Just
like your bath-water appears to you - oil, sweat, fi l th, d i rt y water, all k inds
of loathsome stuff - such is enc h port ion of l i fe, 11nd every Nllh11t11ncc. " 41 In

Marcus Aurelius

1 85

the first instance, this k i n d of contemptuous expression is reserved for the
fles h and the body, which Marcus calls " m u d , " "dirt," and "impure blood. " 42
Yet the same treannent is reserved for things mankind usually considers as
i m p ortan t val u es :
These foods and dishes . . . are only dead fish, birds and pigs; this
Fa lem ian wine is a bit of grape-juice; this purple-edged toga is some
s heep' s hairs dipped in the blood of shellfish; as for sex, it is the rubbing
together of pieces of gut, followed by the spasmodic secretion of a little
bit of slime.43
Marcus takes a similarly illusion-free view of h uman activities: "Everything
h i gh l y prized in life is empty, petty, and putrid; a pack of l i ttl e dogs biting
each other; little children who fight, then laugh, then burst out crying. " 44 T he
war in which Marcus defended the borders of the empire was, for him, like
a hunt for Sarmatian slaves, not unlike a spider's hunt for flies . 45 Marcus cast
a pitiless glance on the chaotic agi ta tion of human m ar i on ettes : "Think about
what they're like when they're eating, s leep i n g , copulating, defecating. Then
think of what t h e y ' re like when they' re acting proud and important, when
they get angry and upbraid their inferiors. " "" Human a gi ta t ion is all the more
ridiculous beca u se it lasts only an instant, and ends up as very little indeed:
" Yesterd ay , a little bit of slime, tomorrow ashes or a mummy." 47
Two words suffice to sum up the human comedy: all is banal, and all is
e p hemera l . Banal, because nothing is new under the sun:
Al wa y s bear in mind that everything is e x actl y the way it comes to pass
right now; it has happened that way before, and it will happen that way
a ga i n . Make them come alive before your mind's eye, these monotonous
dramas and scenes, which y o u know through your own e xp er i e nce or
th rou gh ancient history; picture the whole court of Hadrian, of Antoni­
nus, of P hi lip , Alexander, an d Croesus. All these spectacles were
identical; the only thing that changed were the actors.48

Banality and boredom reach the poi nt of bei n g sickening:
Just as you get sick of the games in the arena and such places, because
they arc always the same, and their monotony makes the spectacle
tedious, so feel the same way about l ife as a whole. From top to bottom,
everything is th e same, and comes from the same causes. How long will
this go on?49
N ot on ly arc hu m 1tn nffnirs tedious: t h ey arc also t ra ns i t ory. Marcus tries to

the days of Trajan or Vespasian, with their weddings, illnesses, wars, feasts,
trading, agriculture, ambition, and intrigues. All these human masses have
disappeared without a trace, observes Marcus, along with their activities.
Marcus also tries to imagine this incessant process of destruction at work
upon those around him.51
Marcus has no patience for those who would try to console themselves for
the brevity of existence by the hope that they will survive in the name they
leave to posterity. "What's in a name?" he asks: "A mere noi se , or a faint
echo. " 52 At best, this miserable, fleeting thing will be transmitted to a few
generations, each of which will last as long as a lightning-flash in the infinity
of time.53 We ought not to be fooled by such an illusion: "How many do not
even know your name, and how many will very soon forget it." 54 "Soon you
will have forgotten everything; soon, too, everything will have forgotten
you." ss
Such an accumulation of pessimistic utterances is indeed impressive. We
should be careful, however, of deducing from them over-hasty conclusions
about Marcus' own psychology. It is too facile for us to imagine that, like
many modem authors, ancient writers wrote in order directly to communicate
information, or the emotions they happened to be feeling. We assume, for
instance, that Marcus' Meditations were intended to transmit his everyday
feelings to us; that Lucretius was himself an anxious person, and used his
poem On the Nature of Things to try to combat his anxiousness; that
Augustine was really confessing himself in his Confessions. In fact, however,
it is not enough to consider the obvious, surface meaning of the phrases in an
ancient text in order fully to understand it. Rather, we must try to understand
why these phrases were written or spoken; we must discover their finality.
Generally speaking, we can say that Marcus' seemingly pessimistic declara­
tions are not expressions of his disgust or disillusion at the spectacle of life;
rather, they are a means he employs in order to change his way of evaluating
the events and objects which go to make up human existence. He does this
by defining these events and objects as they really are - "physically," one
might say - separating them from the conventional representations people
habitually form of them. Marcus' definitions of food, wine, purple togas, or
sexual union arc intended to be "natural. " They are technical, almost medical
definitions of objects which, when considered in a purely "human" way,
provoke the most violent passions, and we are to use them to free ourselves
from the fascination they exercise upon us. Such definitions do not express
Marcus' impressions; on the contrary, they correspond to a point of view
intended to be objective, and which is by no means Marcus' invention. Already
in antiquity, for instance, Hippocrates and Democritus were said to have
defined sexual union as "a little epilepsy."
When Marcus pitiles.11 ly imagines the i ntimate life of the arrogant "ea t i ng,
sleeping, copulating, defecating," he iH t ry i ng lo ((ivc 11 p/011fral v iNinn of

1 87

human reality. We find a similar reflection in Epictetus, concerning people
who are content just to discourse about philosophy: "I'd like to stand over
one of these philosophers when he's having sex, so as to see how he sweats
and strains, what kind of grunts and groans he utters; whether he can even
remember his own name, much less the philosophical discourses he has heard,
declaimed, or read! " 56 Marcus applies the same method to our idea of death:
"consider what it is to die; and that, if one looks at death in and of itself,
dissolving the images associated with death by taking apart our common

conception of it, he will not suspect it to be anything other than a product of
Na tu re. " 57
As we have seen, Marcus' effort to confront existence in all its naked reality
leads him to glimpse processes of decay and dissolution already at work in the
people and things around him, or to make the court of Augustus come alive
before his eyes for an instant, so as to realize that all these people, so alive in
his imagination, are in fact long dead. Yet we have no more right to interpret
this as obsession with death or morbid complacency than when, in the film
Dead Poets ' Socie�y, Robin Williams makes his students study a picture of the
school's old boys. Williams' character is trying to make his charges under­
stand the meaning of carpe diem ("seize the day"), the irreplaceable value of
each instant of life, and it is with this goal in mind that he emphasizes that
all the faces in the class photograph, so young and alive, arc now long dead.
Moreover, when Marcus speaks of the monotony of human existence, it is
not in order to express his own boredom, but in order to persuade himself
that death will not deprive us of anything essential. In Lucretius, the same
argument is used by nature herself, to console man for the misfortune of
death: "There is no new invention I can think up to please you; everything
is always the same . . . what lies in store for you is always the same
even
if you were never to die." 58
In the case of Marcus Aurelius, all these declarations are the conscious,
voluntary application of a method which he formulates in the following terms:
.

.

.

always make a definition or description of the object that occurs in your
representation, so as to be able to see it as it is iri its essence, both as a
whole and as divided into its constituent parts, and say to yourself its
proper name and the names of those things out of which it is composed,
and into which it will be dissolved.59
This method is quintessentially Stoic: it consists in refusing to add subjective
value-judgments - such as "this object is unpleasant," "that one is good,"
"this one is bad," "that one is beautiful," "this is ugly" - to the "objective"
represen tation of things which do not depend on us, and therefore have no
morn! v11l uc.·. The StoicK' notorious phantasia kata/eptike

refrain from adding any judgment value to naked reality.60 In the words of
Epictetus: "we shall never give our assent to anything but that of which we
have an objective representation," 61 and he adds the following illustration:
So-and-so's son is dead.
What happened?
His son is dead.
Nothing else?
Not a thing.
So-and so's ship sank.
What h a ppened?
His ship sank.
So-and-so was carted off to prison.
Wh at happened?
He was carted off to prison.
- But if we now add to this "He has had bad luck," then each of us is
adding this observation on his own account.62
In these objective/realistic definitions, some historians63 believe they can
discover the traces of an attitude of repugnance in the face of matter and the
objects of the physical world. Thus, according to this view, Marcus Aurelius
renounced the Stoic doctrine of the immanence of divine reason in the world
and in ma tter , and there is no longer any trace in him of the admiration felt
by Chrysippus for the phenomenal world. We can therefore, it is alleged, find
traces in Marcus of a tendency to affirm the transcendence of a divinity
existing apart from the phenomenal world.
Some passages in Marcus do indeed seem provocative in this regard, but
they require the most painstaking interpretation. When, for instance, Marcus
evokes "the putridity of the matter underlying all things . . . liquid, dust,
bones, stench," M he does not mean to say that matter itself is putrefaction;
rather, he wants to emphasize that the transformations of matter, qua natural
processes, are necessarily accompanied by phenomena which seem to us to be
repugnant, although in reality they too are natural.
The passage we have cited above65 may seem even more provocative: "Just
like your bath-water appears to you - oil, sweat, filth, dirty water, all kinds
of loathsome stuff - such is each portion of life, and every s u bs tanc e . " This
concise text can be interpreted in several different ways. In the first place, we
could say that Marcus is here applying his method of objective definitions.
What he means to say would be this: "when I observe p hysica l and
physiological phenomena as t h ey truly are, I h a v e to admit that t h e re nre
many aspects of them which seem to me to he d iNl(UNt inl( or 1 rlvi11l: 1 hcy

Marcus Aurelius

1 89

consist of dust, the filth which covers abandoned objects, bad smells, and
stenches. Our objective representation must recognize all .these aspects of
reality, without seeking to conceal any of them." Yet this realist vision has a
threefold function. In the first place, it is intended to prepare us to confront
life such as it is. As Seneca remarks,
To be offended by these things is just as ridiculous as to complain that
you got splashed in the bath, or that you got pushed around in a crowd,
or that you got dirty in a mud-puddle. The same things happen in life
as in the baths, in a crowd, or on the road . . . Life is not a delicate
thing .66
Secondly, the realistic outlook is not intended to deny the immanence of
reason in the world, but to persuade us to search for reason where it can be
found in its purest state: in the daimon or inner genius, that guiding principle
w i thi n man, source o f freedom an d pri nci p l e o f the moral life .
Finally, by reinforcing the sombre tones of disgust and repulsion, such
definitions are intended to provide a contrast with the splendid illumination
which transfigures all things when we consider them from the perspective of
universal reason. Elsewhere, Marcus does not hesitate to declare:
Everything comes from above, whether it has originated directly in that
common directing principle, or whether it is a necessary consequence
thereof. Thus, the gaping jaws of a lion, poison, and all kinds of
unpleasant things, like thorns and mud, are by-products of those
venerable, beautiful things on high. Don't imagine, therefore, that these
unpleasant things are alien to that principle you venerate, but rather
consider that source of all things.67
Here it is quite clear that filth, dust, and other such apparently repulsive
aspects of reality are the necessary consequence of a natural process which, in
the last analysis, goes back to universal reason. It is thus not matter itself
which seems repulsive to us, but the accessory phenomena which accompany
its transformations. Here Marcus68 is in complete accord with Stoic ortho­
doxy, according to which matter is docile and subservient to reason, which
molds and governs it. The function of Marcus' physico/objective definitions
is precisely to make us realize that the feelings of repulsion we feel in the
presence of some phenomena which accompany natural processes are nothing
but an anthropocentric prejudice. In the following charming passage, Marcus
expresses his belief that nature is beautiful in all its aspects:
There iK Komc:t hing p le asa n t and attractive about even the incidental
hy-prudm· 1 11 of 1111 1 u r 1d l'hc:nomc:na. For instance, when bread is being

Figures

190

baked, some parts of it split open, and it is precisely those parts which
split apart in this way, and which, in a sense, have nothing to do with
bread-making itself, which are somehow quite appropriate, and excite
our appetite in a most particular way. The same is true of figs: it is when
they are at their ripest that they burst open. In the case of very ripe
olives, it is precisely their proximity to decay which adds to them a
certain beauty. The same is true with ripe ears of corn which bend
towards the ground; with the lion's wrinkled fo rehead ; with the foam
spuming forth from the mouths of wild pigs, and many other such
things: if we look at them in isolation, they are far from being beautiful.
Nevertheless, because they are incidental by-products of natural pro­
cesses, they add to the beauty of these processes and have an attractive
effect on us. Thus, as long as one has a feeling for, and a deep
understanding of Nature's processes, there is scarcely any of the things
that occur as incidental by-products which will not present itself to one
as pleasant, at least in some of its aspects. Such a person . . . will look
upon the actual gaping jaws of wild beasts with no less pleasure than
upon all the imitations of them that sculptors and painters offer us. With
his wise vision, he will be able to discern the rich maturity of old men
and women, as well as the lovely charm in young children; and there
arc many such things, which do not appeal to everyone; only to that
person who has truly familiarized himself with nature and its workings.69
It is instructive to compare this text with the passage from Aristotle quoted
abovc.70
Already in Aristotle, but especially in Marcus Aurelius, we can see a
revolution taking place. In the place of an idealistic aesthetics, which considers
as beautiful only that which is rational and functional, manifesting beautiful
proportions and an ideal form, there appears a realistic aesthetics which finds
beauty in things just the way they are, in everything that lives and exists. We
know from Aulus Gellius,71 moreover, that Marcus' distinction between
nature's original plan and the unforeseen consequences resulting from this
plan goes back to Chrysippus. Thus, in this case as well, Marcus stands firmly
within orthodox Stoic tradition.
To return to the "provocative" passage with which we began:72 it appears
that Marcus' meaning is as follows. When dealing with what the Stoics
termed indiflerentia73 that is, things which depend not upon us, but upon
universal nature- we must not make any distinction between what is repulsive
and what is pleasant; any more than does nature itself.74 Dirt, mud, and
thorns, after all, come from the same source as the rose and the springtime.
Thus, from the point of view of nature, and therefore also of whoever is
familiar with nature, there is no d isti nction t.o he made between hat h-water
and the rest of ercntion : cvcryth i n l{ iN l'lJ U n l l y "nnt u r11I . "

Marcus Aurelius

We can hardly hope to deduce Marcus' psychological states from any of
the preceding. Was he an optimist or a pessimist? Did he suffer from a
stomach ulcer? The Meditations do not allow us to respond to these questions.
All we can learn from them is about spiritual exercises, as they were
traditionally practiced by the Stoics.
2

Epictetus

In Marcus Aurelius' day, the greatest authority in questions of Stoicism was
Epictetus. As the slave of Epaphroditus, one of Nero's freedmen, Epictetus
had attended the classes of the Stoic Musonius Rufus. When Epictetus in turn
was subsequently freed by Epaphroditus, he opened a philosophy school at
Rome. In AD 93-4, Epictetus fell victim to the edict by which the emperor
Domitian banished philosophers from Rome and Italy, and he set himself up
in Nicopolis in Epirus. There he opened another school, where one of his
regular students was the future civil servant and historian Arrian of Nicom­
edia. It was Arrian who was responsible for transmitting what we know about
Epictetus' teaching; for Epictetus, like many philosophers in antiquity, never
wrote anything down.
What Arrian thus preserved for us was not the technical part of Epictetus'
philosophical instruction - his commentaries on Stoic authors such as
Chrysippus, for example, or his more general explanations of doctrine.
Rather, what Arrian copied down was the discussions which, as was usual in
ancient philosophical schools, took place after the technical part of the class.
In these discussions, the master would reply to q u est ions from his audience,
or enlarge upon particular points which were of importance for leading a
philosophical life.75 It is important to emphasize this point, for it means that
we must not expect to find technical, systematic expositions of every aspect
of Stoic doctrines in Epictetus' Discourses. Instead, they deal with a rather
limited number of problems, for the most part restricted to ethical matters.
This does not prove, of course, that Epictetus did not take up the whole of
the Stoic system in the course of his theoretical teaching. Besides, only the
first four books of Arrian's work have survived. We know from a passage in
Aulus Gellius,76 who cites an extract from the fifth book of Epictetus'
Discourses, that a part of the work has been lost. For these two reasons, then,
we must be wary of concluding, on the basis of these collections of Arrian's
notes, that theoretical philosophical teaching gradually became impoverished
in the course of later Stoicism.
What we can say is that Epictetus did insist very strongly upon a concept
that was traditional in Stoicism:n the difference between discourse about
philosophy and the practice of philosophy itself.

physics and logic; that is, the study of nature and of the rules of d iscourse.
On the other, there was the practical part of philosophy, corresponding to
ethics. This is incorrect. Rather, both theoretical philosophical discourse

and

philosophy itself as it was lived and experienced were made up of three
constituent parts.
In theoretical philosophical discourse, the three parts of philosophy were
necessarily distinguished. They were made the object of separate explanations,
developed according to a logical principle of succession, and they laid the
foundations for and developed the basic principles of Stoic doctrine. On the
level of theoretical discourse, then, the parts of philosophy were in a sense
external to one another, in accordance with the requirements of didactic

act, renewed at each instant, and it may be j ust as well described as the
exercise of logic, physics, or ethics, according to the subject-matter on which
it is exercised, without its unity being in any way diminished. On this level,
we are no longer concerned with theoretical logical - that is, the theory of
correct reasoning - rather, we are concerned not to let ourselves be deceived
in our everyday lives by false representations. We arc no longer concerned
with theoretical physics - the theory of the origin and evolution of the cosmos
- we are concerned with being aware at every instant that we are
cosmos, and that

we

parts

of the

must make our desires conform to this situation . We no

longer do ethical theory - the definition and classification of virtues and
duties - we simply

act

in an ethical way.

Concrete philosophical praxis requires that we always bear in mind
the S toics' fundamental dogmas. These dogmas were i ntended to con­
stitute the basis for our rectitude of judgment, our attitude toward the
cosmos, and the conduct we should adopt towards our fellow citizens within
the city. Philosophy as it was lived and experienced thus implied continuous
exercises of meditation and constant vigilance, in order to keep alive in one's
mind the principles taught by theoretical discourse.
If we want to understand why Epictetus attaches so much importance to
what he terms "the three areas of exercises," we shall have to bear in mind
this distinction between theoretical philosophical discourse and concrete
philosophy as it is lived and experienced . In the

Discourses

as reported by

Arrian, these three areas are presented with such systematic rigor that we are
j ustified in suspecting that this doctrine had an important role to play in
Epictetus' theoretical teaching.
Epictetus bases his doctrine on the traditional Stoic distinction between

things which depend on us and things which do not: "What depends on us
is value-judgments, inclinations to act, desires, aversions, and, in a word ,
everything that is our doing. What does not depend on us is the body, wealth,
glory, high poli tical positions, and, in a word , everything that is not our own

doing . " 78 What depends u1,on us is t he nets of our own soul , hcc11 u11c we 11rc

Marcus Aurelius

1 93

able freely to choose them. What does not depend on us is those things that
depend on the general course of nature and of fate. Among the acts of the
soul which do depend on us, some correspond to the area of judgment and
assent, others to the area of desire, and, finally, still others correspond to the
area of inclinations to action.
For Epictetus, then, it is these three areas, acts of the soul, or aspects of
"that which depends on us" which define the three forms of philosophical
exercises. By comparing the relevant passages in Epictetus' Discourses,19 we
can present the theory of the three forms or areas of philosophical exercises
as follows.
The first area is that of desire and aversion. People are unhappy because
they desire things they may either lose or fail to obtain, and because they try
to avoid misfortunes which are often inevitable. This happens because such
desiderata as wealth and health, for example, do not depend on us. The
discipline of desire consequently consists in accustoming ourselves to the
gradual renunciation of such desires and aversions, so that, in the end, we
shall desire only that which does depend on us - moral virtue - and shall also
avoid only that which depends on us - moral evil . We are to regard everything
which does not depend on us as indifferent; that is to say, we must not make
any difference between such things. Rather, we must accept them all, willed as
they are by universal nature. The discipline of desire concerns the passions
or emotions ( pathe) which we feel as a result of what happens to us.
The second area of exercises is that of motivating inclinations, or action.
For Epictetus, this area is related first and foremost to human relationships
within the city. It corresponds to what the Stoics traditionally called "the
duties" (ta kathekonta): those actions which are appropriate to the inclinations
of our nature. Duties are actions - they thus fall under the category of things
which depend on us - bearing upon objects which do not depend on us - such
as other people, politics, health, art, etc. As we have seen, such objects ought
to be matters of indifference; yet, by dint of a reasonable justification, they
can be considered as corresponding to that deeply-embedded instinct which
impels rational human nature to act for its own conservation. Duties are thus
actions "appropriate" to our rational nature, and they consist in placing
ourselves in the service of the human community, in the form of the city/state
and of the family.
The third area of exercises is that of assent (sunkatathesis). Epictetus urges
us to criticize each representation ( phantasia) as it presents itself to us, and
give our assent only to that which is "objective." In other words, we are to
set aside all subjective value-judgments. Epictetus formulates the principle
guiding this exercise as follows: "People are not troubled by things, but by
their j ud gemen ts abo111 things. " 80
For Epk-u:tu11, these three areas (topoi) of exercise correspond to the
t hree 1111pcL' I N 1 11 ' 11hil111111phy as it is l i ved and experienced , as opposed to

1 94

Figures

the three parts of philosophical discourse. This becomes clear from a passage
in the Discourses in which he criticizes pseudo-philosophers, who are content
just to read theoretical discourses about philosophy. Here we can clearly see
that the second and third areas correspond respectively to ethics and to
dialectics. The connection between logic and the third of our topoi is
particularly evident:
It is as if, in the area of the exercise of assent, we were surrounded by
representations, some of them "objective" and others not, and we did not
want to distinguish between them, but preferred to read treatises with
titles like On Comprehension! How does this come about? The reason is
that we have never carried out our reading or our writing in such a way
that, when it comes to action, we could use the representations we receive
in a way consonant with nature; instead, we arc content when we have
learned what is said to us, and can explain it to others; when we can
analyze syllogisms and examine hypothetical arguments.81
In this passage, Epictetus underlines the opposition between, on the one hand,
theoretical logic, as it was set forth in treatises with titles like On Comprehen­
sion; and, on the other, what we might term "lived logic," or logic as applied
to life, which consists in the discipline of assent, and the critique of those
representations which actually do present themselves to us. In the rest of this
passage, we find the same opposition between theoretical discourse and
practical, "lived" exercises, this time with regard to the second area. Epictetus
shows that the only justification for reading theoretical treatises like On
Inclination or On Duties is so that, in concrete situations, we can act in
conformity with mankind's rational nature.
In the tripartite division of philosophy,112 the areas of logic and ethics are
followed by that of physics. Can physics, then, be made to correspond to the
discipline of desire? It would seem as though the passage we have just quoted
prohibits such an identification. When, in the context of the discipline of
desire, Epictetus speaks of treatises entitled On Desire and Aversion, we have
every reason to believe these were treatises relating to ethics. However, even
though the abstract theory of "desire" as such, insofar as it is an act of the
soul, pertains to the areas of ethics and psychology, the lived attitude which
corresponds to the discipline of desire does indeed seem to be a kind of
applied physics, which one lives and experiences in the manner of a spiritual
exercise. On several occasions, Epictetus insists that the discipline of desire
consists in "learning to desire that everything happen just the way it does
happen." 83 We are to "keep our will in harmony with what happens," JH and
to "be well-pleased with the divine government of things . " Hl "If a good man
could foresee the future, he wou l d cooper11 te w i t h Nick ness, death , and

order of things, and that the whole is more important than its parts." 86 We
have here a true case of physics lived and experienced as a spiritual exercise.
Since, in order to discipline their desires, people need to be intensely
conscious of the fact that they are a part of the cosmos, they must replace
each event within the perspective of universal nature.
Such, for Epictetus, is the practice and exercise of philosophy, and we find
this fundamental scheme repeated throughout the Discourses. Epictetus'
disciple Arrian, who was responsible for the redaction of both the Discourses
and the Manual, made no mistake in this regard, when he chose to group the
sayings which make up the Manual according to the three disciplines or areas
we have just distinguished. 87

Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus

It is fair to say that the essential substance of Marcus Aurelius' Meditations c.-omes
from Epictetus. In the first place, it is probably from Epictetus that Marcus got
the very idea of the literary genre of meditation by means of writing: "These are
the kinds of things on which lovers of wisdom ought to meditate; they ought to
write them down every day, and use them to train themselves." 811 "Let these
thoughts be 'at hand' for you, day and night Write them down and re-read them;
talk about them, both to yourself and with others." 119
The idea of dialogue with oneself had existed for a long time; one thinks
of Homer's depiction of Odysseus admonishing himself: "Bear up, my
heart." 90 The custom of writing down, for one's personal use, either one's
own thoughts or the sayings one has read is also no doubt extremely old .
Nevertheless, we have every reason to believe that it was from Epictetus that
Marcus derived the idea of this particular form of self-exhortation and
conversation with oneself, bearing as it does upon the same rules of life and
principles of action upon which Epictetus had advised his readers to meditate.
The object of Marcus' meditations and exercises was none other than
Epictetus' three fundamental themes: the discipline of desire, the discipline
of inclinations, and the discipline of judgment. This conceptual structure is
peculiar to Epictetus, and is found nowhere else in the philosophical literature
of antiquity.91 Moreover, in the course of a series of quotations from
Epictetus, Marcus cites a fragm e n t which clearly sets forth the three themes
we have been examining:
What must be found is a method with regard to assent [to sugkatatit/1es1hai ]. In the area [topos] of the inclinations [honnai ], we must keep
vigilant our attentive faculty, so that these inclinations may operate with
reserve:, in l hc 11crvicc of the community, and in a way corresponding to
t he v11lur uf l h l'i r ohjcclN. Finally, when it comes to t h i n gs that do not

1 96

Figures

depend on us, we must abstain totally from desire [orekseos apekhesthai ]
and feel no aversion towards any of them.92
Additionally, Marcus repeatedly formulates the triple rule of life himself. We
can easily recognize it in the following passages:
What is enough for you?
- Your present value-judgement, so long as it is

objective;

- The action you are accomplishing at the present moment, so long as it
is done for the benefit of the human community;
- Your present inner disposition, as long as it rejoices in every event
brought about by causes outside yoursclf.93
A rational nature is proceeding as it should if it fulfills the following
conditions:
- If, in its representations [ phantasiai ], it does not give its assent
[sugkatatithemene] either to what is false, or to what is unclear;
- If it guides its inclinations [honnas] only towards those actions which
serve the human community;
- If it has desire [orekseis] or aversion only for things that depend on us,
while joyfully greeting everything allotted to it by universal nature.94
Wipe out your representations [ phantasian].
Check your inclinations [honnaij.
Extinguish your desire [oreksin].
Keep your directing principle [hegemonikon] under your control.95
On what, then, should we exert our efforts? Only this:
- correct intentions;
- actions [prakseis] carried out in the service of the community;
- speech [logos] which could never be used to deceive;
- an inner disposition [diathesis] which joyfully greets each event like
something necessary and familiar, since it flows from so grand a
principle, and so great a source.'16
The reader will perhaps have noticed that, although it is quite obvious that
Marcus Aurelius took over his tripartite structure from Epictetus, there is
nevertheless a difference in tone and emphasis in Marcus' presentation of it.
When, for instance, Marcus speaks of the discipline of desire, he does not, a s
Epictetus had done, insist on the necessity of desiring only those t h i n gs which
depend on us - that is, moral good so that our desires may n ot be frustrated .
Rather, Marcus, in n m u c h more e xp l i ci t way thlln EpictctuK, concei ves of this
-

exercise as putting our desires in harmony with the will of fa te 1111d of

Marcus Aurelius

1 97

universal reason. Its goal is to bring about within us an attitude of indifference
to indifferent things; that is, whatever does not depend on us. For Marcus,
much more than for Epictetus, the discipline of desire takes on the form of
applied "physics," or physics transformed into a spiritual exercise.
The discipline of desire culminates in a joyful, loving satisfaction97 in
the events willed by nature. But in order to achieve this state, we must
totally change our way of looking at things. We must consider them from the
point of view of universal nature, and this implies learning to recognize the
chain of causes which produce each event. We are to consider each event as
woven by destiny, and as flowing forth by natural necessity from the first
causes. The discipline of desire thus obliges us to relocate the totality of
human life within a coi.m ic perspective, and become aware of the fact that we
are a part of the world : "He who doesn't know what the world is doesn't
know where he himself is, either. He who doesn't know for what purpose the
world exists, doesn't know who he is himself. Whoever doesn't know the
answer to one of these questions is unable to say for what purpose he himself
exists." 98
In order to practice this kind of "physics," Marcus, as we have seen, tries
to follow a rigorous method of definition,99 which consists in relocating all
objects within the totality of the universe, and all events within the nexus of
causes and effects. They are to be defined in and for themselves, and
separated from the conventional, anthropomorphic representations mankind
habitually makes of them.
Here we can perhaps glimpse in what way the three disciplines, like the
three parts of philosophy, imply one another within the single act of
philosophizing. The method of "physical" definition discussed by Marcus
corresponds to the discipline of assent, which prescribes that we must give
our assent only to those representations which are objective and freed from
all subjective value-judgments.
Once prolonged experience has allowed us to come to know nature's ways
and laws, "physics," when practiced as a spiritual exercise, leads us to
"familiarity" with nature . 11lD Thanks to this familiarity, we can perceive the
links between all phenomena which seem strange or repugnant to us, and
between these phenomena and universal reason, the source from which they
flow. From such a perspective, every event will seem to us beautiful and
worthy of our affectionate assent. To be indifferent to indifferent things means
to make no difference between them; in other words, to love them equally, just
as nature does: " 'The earth loves the rain; she also loves the venerable
Ether.'1 0 1 And the Universe, too, loves to produce all that must be produced.
Thus, I say to the Universe: 'I love along with you!' Isn't this, after all, the
mean i n g of of the phrase, 'Such-and-such an event "loves" to happen?' " 1 02
W hen , in ancient G reek, one wished to say that something "usually occurs,"
m "iN lll'CUNtomcd to occur," n co m mon idiom made it pm;siblc to sny the

198

Figures

event "loves" to occur ( philei ginesthai). Here, Marcus gives us to understand
that events literally "love" to happen. We are to "love" to see them happen,
because universal nature "loves" to produce them.
In the last analysis, such an attitude of joyful consent to the world
corresponds to an attitude of obedience to the divine will. This is why Marcus
sometimes describes the discipline of desire as an invitation to "follow the
gods" or "God," as in the following presentation of the three disciplines:
"Keep the daimon within you in a state of serenity; so that it may follow God
in an appropriate way, neither saying anything contrary to the truth, nor doing
anything contrary to justice." 103 In the formulation of the second theme,
Epictetus placed more emphasis on the fact that our inclinations and actions
must be related to our duties (kathekonta) toward our fellow-men. Marcus, by
contrast, speaks more often about just actions, done in the service of the
human community. As was the case with the first theme, the second theme
takes on a strongly emotional tonality for Marcus: we must love other people
with all our hearts, he writes,1°" for rational beings are not only parts of the
same whole, but the limbs of the same body. Moreover, we arc to extend our
love even toward those who commit injustices against us, bearing in mind that
they belong to the same human race as we do, and that, if they sin, they do
so involuntarily, and out of ignorance.105
Marcus differs the least from Epictetus in his presentation of the third
theme, the discipline of assent. The discipline Marcus imposes on himself
relates, however, not only to the inner logos - that is, to the assent we give
to our representations (phantasia1) - but also to the outer logos; that is, our
manner of expressing ourselves . 1111• Herc, the fundamental virtue is that of
truth, understood as rectitude of thought and speech. Lies, even when
involuntary, arc the result of the deformation of our faculty of judgment.107
When formulating the triple rule of life, Marcus also likes to insist on the fact
that we must concentrate on the prese111 moment: the present representation, the
present action, and the present inner disposition (whether of desire or of aversion).
We find nothing of the sort in Epictetus, yet Marcus' attitude here is in complete
accord with the fundamental Stoic attitude of attention (prosoche) as directed
toward the present moment. 'Oii Nothing must escape the vigilance of conscious­
ness : neither our relationship to destiny and the way of the world - this is the
discipline of desire - nor our relationship with our fellow men (discipline of the
active will), nor, finally, our relationship to ourselves (discipline of assent).
Elsewhere, Marcus links the three philosophical exercises to their corres­
ponding virtues. We thus have the following schema:
Discipline

Corresponding virtue

Of desire
Of inclinations
Of assent

Temperance (sophro�J'1fe); absence of worries (al<1rtu·ia)
Justice (dikaitJ�J'llt')
Truth (11/etl1ei<1); 11hi;cncc of h urry (t1prt1ptosi11).

Marcus Aurelius

1 99

Marcus enumerates the three virtues corresponding to the three disciplines in
the following terms: "Absence of hurry, love of our fellow-men, obedience to
the gods." 109
This vocabulary is totally absent from Epictetus' Discourses. How are we to
explain these differences in the way Marcus and Epictetus present the three
fundamental exercises of philosophy?
In the first place, it seems certain that Marcus possessed more information
about Epictetus' teachings than we do today. In the first book of his

Meditations,1 10 Marcus tells us that he came to know the writings of Epictetus
thanks to Quintus Junius Rusticus, a statesman who had taught Marcus the
fundamentals of Stoic doctrine before going on to become one of his
counsellors. Marcus states that Rusticus loaned him his personal copy of
Epictetus' hypomnemata; that is, a book of notes taken down at his classes.
This statement can be interpreted in two ways:

The book in question could be a copy of the work by Arrian. In the
prefatory letter he placed at the beginning of his edition of Epictetus'
Discourses, Arrian himself describes his work as a collection of hypomnemata:
Whatever I heard him say, I tried to write down, using his very words
as far as possible, so that I should have in the future some "notes
intended to help me remember" [hypomnemata] of his thought and his
frankness. As was to be expected, these notes often have the appearance
of an improvised, spontaneous conversation between two men, not such
as one would write if he was expecting them to be read one day. 1 1 1
Now, Arrian had come to attend the classes o f Epictetus sometime between
AD 1 07 and 1 09. His prefatory letter to Lucius Gellius was probably
written after Epictetus' death, some time between 1 25 and 1 30, and the
Discourses themselves were published ca. AD 1 30. Aulus Gellius recounts l lZ
that, in the year he spent studying at Athens - around AD 1 40 he had
been present at a discussion in the course of which the famous millionaire
Herod Atticus had brought to him from a library a copy of what Gellius
refers to as the dissertationes of Epictetus, arrange i:l (digestae) by Arrian. He
also tells how, on the way from Cassiopeia to Brindisium, he came across
a philosopher who had a copy of the same work in his baggage. This shows
that is was at least possible that Marcus read a copy of this book, which
had been loaned to him by Rusticus.
-

2 We might also consider another suggestion, which has already been
proposed by Farquharson. What Rusticus loaned to Marcus, on this
hypothesis, would have been Rusticus' own notes, which he himself had
taken d u rinic Epictetus' lectures. From the chronological point of view, if
we R l'1111t 1 h11 t l•: 11i,•1ct us died between AD 1 25 and 1 30, and if Rusticus was

200

Figures

born at the beginning of the second century, as we are entitled to deduce
from his official cursus, it would then be entirely possible for Rustious to
have been Epictetus' student. Moreover, it is hard to imagine that there
was no copy of Epictetus' Discourses available in Rome around AD 1 45-6,
even though the work had been widely diffused in Greece by 140. Besides,
Marcus represents Rusticus' gift as something exceptional; we are thus
entitled to wonder if the gift may not, after all, have been Rusticus' own
notes. It is, moreover, more or less certain that Marcus had read Arrian's
work, since the Meditations are full of literal citations taken from it.
Whether Marcus had read only the Discourses as arranged by Arrian, or
whether he had read Rusticus' notes as well, one thing is beyond doubt:
Marcus was familiar with more texts concerning Epictetus' teaching than we
are today. We possess only a part of Arrian's work; and if Rusticus' notes did
in fact exist, they may well have revealed to Marcus some aspects of
Epictetus' teachings which had not been noted down by Arrian.
It is thanks to Marcus that we know some otherwise unknown fragments
of Epictetus, such as the following: "You are a little soul, bearing the weight
of a dead body." 1 13 This fragment also goes to show that "pessimistic"
features are not exclusively characteristic of Marcus Aurelius, as has often
been claimed. Thus, we may suppose that the differences in presentation of
the three exercises which we find in Marcus and in the extant works of
Epictetus can be explainc:d by the influence of passages of Epictetus which
were known to Marcus, but subsequently were lost.
Finally, we must not forget that there is a profound difference between the
literary genre of Epictetus' Discourses and Marcus Aurelius' Meditations.
Arrian's work, even if it was more extensively rearranged than its author is
willing to admit in his preface, is quite literally a series of Discourses given
before an audience. Their subject-matter was inspired by specific circum­
stances: questions directed to the master, or visits of people from outside the
school. The argumentation was adapt<.>d to the capacities of the audience, and
its goal was to persuade them.
By contrast, Marcus wa"> alone with himself. For my part, I cannot discern
in the Meditations the hesitations, contradictions, and strugglings of a man
abandoned to his solitude, which some scholars have thought to detect in
them. 1 1� O n the contrary, one is rather astounded by the firmness of thought
and technical nature of the philosophical vocabulary one encounters from
beginning to end of the Meditations. Everything points to the conclusion that
either Marcus had perfectly assimilated the teachings of Rusticus and
Epictetus, or else that he always had Epictetus' own texts at hand, for the
practice of his meditation exercises. One is also astonished, moreover, by the
extraordinary l i te ra ry quality of t he majori t y of the Medittitions. M 11rcus'
former teacher of rhetoric, Fmn10, had tnuicht him how tu finely ch iHd his

Marcus Aurelius

20 1

sentences, and Marcus always sought to give to his thoughts the clarity, rigor,
and striking formulations necessary to give them the sought-after therapeut­
ical and psychagogic effect. After all, it is not enough merely to repeat some
rational principle to oneself, in order to be persuaded of it; 1 15 everything
depends on how you formulate it. The

Meditations

have the appearance of

variations, sometimes executed with supreme virtuosity, on a small number of
fundamental themes; indeed, they are variations almost exclusively on the three
themes first taken up by Epictetus. In some passages, such as those we have seen
cited above, the triple schema, enunciating the three philosophical exercises we
must practice at each instant, is presented in its entirety, with only some slight
variations. Elsewhere, only two of the themes, or even a single one, are presented.
As for the variations: sometimes they develop one or another of the three themes,
at other times they set

forth

motifs associ ated with these principal themes. For

instance, under the heading of the discipline of desire, we are presented with the
theme of destiny weaving for us

in

advance all that is going to happen to us;1 16

or a discussion of the "physical" definition of objects;1 1 7 the natural character of
the accessory phenomena which accompany natural phenomena; 1 1 8 or the theme
of death. 1 1 9 Under the heading of the second discipline, that of inclinations, we
find the associated themes of love for others, 1 20 or of rational action. 121
Thus Marcus, in the course of his solitary meditations, was led to
orchestrate and make explicit everything that was implied by the doctrine of
the three disciplines as proposed by Epictetus. Often, Marcus does little more
than expand upon brief notes which were already sketched in the

Discourses

arranged by Arrian : this is the case for the theme of joyous satisfaction with
the events willed by universal reason, for example, or with the theme of

obedience to the gods. 1 22

To conclude: each time Marcus wrote down one of his

Meditatiom,

he knew

exactly what he was doing: he was exhorting himself to practice one of the
disciplines : either that of desire, of action, or of assent. At the same time, he
was exhorting himself to practice philosophy itself, in its divisions of physics,

ethics, and logic. 1 23

Perhaps now we are in a better position to understand what it is that gives
Marcus Aurelius'

Meditations

the fascinating power· they have exerted over

generations of readers. It is precisely the fact that we have the feeling of
witnessing the practice of spiritual exercises - captured live, so to speak.
There have been a great many preachers, theoreticians, spiritual directors, and
censors in the history of world literature . Yet it is extremely rare to have the
chance to see someone in the process of training himself to be a human being:
"When you have trouble getting up in the morning, let this thought be in
your mind: I'm waking up in order to do a man's work . " 1 24
We have already stressed that Marcus seldom seems to hesitate, stumble,
or foci his way as he practices exercises which follow the directions Epictetus

had skctclml in 1ul v11ncc so precise l y . Nonetheless,

we feel a quite particular

Figures

202

emotion as we catch a person in the process of doing what we are all trying
to do: to give a meaning to our life, to strive to live in a state of perfect
awareness and to give each of life's instants its full value. To be sure, Marcus
is talking to himself, but we still get the impression that he is talking to each
one of us as well .

Reflections on the Idea of the
"Cultivation of the Self"

In his preface to The Use of Pleasure, as well as in a chapter of The Care of
the Self,1 Michel Foucault made mention of.my article 'Exercices spiritucls',
the first version of which dates back to 1976.2 Foucault seems to have been
particularly interested by the following points, which I developed in this
article: the description of ancient philosophy as an art, style, or way of life;
the attempt I made to explain how modern philosophy had forgotten this
tradition, and had become an almost entirely theoretical discourse; and the
idea I sketched out in the article, and have developed more fully above, that
Christianity had taken over as its own certain techniques of spiritual exercises,
as they had already been practiced in antiquity.
Here, I should like to offer a few remarks with a view to delineating the
differences of interpretation, and in the last analysis of philosophical choice,
which separate us, above and beyond our points of agreement. These
differences could have provided the substance for a dialogue between us,
which, unfortunately, was interrupted all too soon by Foucault's premature
death.
In The Care of the Self, Foucault meticulously describes what he terms the
" practices of the sel f " (pratiques de soi), recommended in antiquity by Stoic
philosophers. These include the care of one's self, which can only be carried
out under the direction of a spiritual guide; the attention paid to the body
and the soul which the "care of the self" implies; exercises of abstinence;
examination of the conscience; the filtering of representations; and, finally,
the conversion toward and possession of the self. M. Foucault conceives of
these practices as "arts of existence" and "techniques of the self. "
I t i s quite true that, i n this connection, the ancients d i d speak o f a n "art o f
living. " It s e em s to me, however, that the description M . Fouca u l t !( i v e s of
w h a t I h11d t e rmed "spi r i t ual e x ercises , " anti w h ich he prcfc1·11 111 cil l l

Reflections on the Idea of the "Cultivation of the Self"

"techniques of the self," is precisely focused far too much on the "self," or at
least on a specific conception of the self.
In particular, Foucault presents Greco-Roman ethics as an ethics of the
pleasure one takes in oneself: "Access to the self is liable to replace this kind
of violent, uncertain, and temporary pleasures with a form of pleasure one
takes in oneself, serenely and forever." 3 To illustrate his point, Foucault cites
Seneca's twenty-third Letter, where he speaks of the joy one can find within
oneself, and specifically within the best portion of oneself. In fact, however,
I must say that there is a great deal of inexactitude in this way of
presenting the matter. In Letter 23, Seneca explicitly opposes voluptas
and ga udium - pleasure and joy - and one cannot, therefore, speak of
"another form of pleasure," as does Foucault (Care of the Self, p. 83)
when talking about joy. This is not j ust a quibble over words, although
the Stoics did attach a great deal of importance to words, and care­
fully distinguished between hedone - "pleasure" - and eupatheia "joy".4 No,
this is no mere question of vocabulary. If the Stoics insist on the word
gaudimn/"joy," it is precisely because they refuse to introduce the principle
of pleasure into moral life. For them, happiness does not consist in pleasure,
but in virtue itself, which is its own reward. Long before Kant, the
Stoics strove jealously to preserve the purity of intention of the moral
consciousness.
Secondly and most importantly, it is not the case that the Stoic finds his
joy in his "self;" rather, as Seneca says, he finds it "in the best portion of the
self," in "the true good . " 5 Joy is to be found "in the conscience turned
towards the good; in intentions which have no other object than virtue; in just
actions." 6 Joy can be found in what Seneca calls "perfect reason" 7 (that is to
say, in divine reason)8 since for him, human reason is nothing other than
reason capable of being made perfect. The "best portion of oneself," then, is,
in the last analysis, a transcendent self. Seneca does not find his joy in
"Seneca," but by transcending "Seneca"; by discovering that there is within
him - within all human beings, that is, and within the cosmos itself - a reason
which is a part of universal reason.
In fact, the goal of Stoic exercises is to go beyond the self, and think and
act in unison with universal reason . The three exercises described by Marcus
Aurelius,9 following Epictetus, are highly significant in this regard . As we saw
above, they are as follows:
-

1 to j udge objectively, in accordance with inner reason;
2 to act in accordance with the reason which all human beings have in
common; and
3 to accept the destiny imposed u pon us by cosmic reason. For the Stoics,
th e re is o n l y one single reason at work here, and this reason is man ' s true
Rel f.

I can well understand Foucault's motives for giving short shrift to these
aspects, of which he was perfectly aware. His description of the practices of
the self - like, moreover, my description of spiritual exercises - is not merely
an historical study, but rather a tacit attempt to offer contemporary mankind
a model of life, which Foucault calls "an aesthetics of existence. " Now,
according to a more or less universal tendency of modern thought, which is
perhaps more instinctive than reflective, the ideas of "universal reason" and
"universal nature" do not have much meanin g any more. It was therefore

convenient to "bracket" them.
For the moment, then, let us say that, from an historical point of view, it
seems difficult to accept that the philosophical practice of the Stoics and
Platonists was nothing but a relationship to one's self, a culture of the self, or
a pleasure taken in oneself. The psychic content of these exercises seems to
me to be something else entirely. In my view, the feeling of belonging to a
whole is an essential element: belonging, that is, both to the whole constituted
by the human community, and to that constituted by the cosmic whole.
Seneca sums it up in four words: Toti se inserens mundo,10 "Plunging oneself
into the totality of the world." In his adminble Anthropo/ogie philosophique, 1 1
Groethuysen pointed out the importance o f this fundamental point. Such a
cosmic perspective radically transforms the feeling one has of oneself.
Oddly, Foucault does not have much to say about the Epicureans. This is
all the more surprising in that Epicurean ethics is, in a sense, an ethics
without norms. It is an autonomous ethics, for it cannot found itself upon
nature, which according to its views is the product of chance. It would seem,
therefore, to be an ethics perfectly suited to the modern mentality. Perhaps
the reason for this silence is to be found in the fact that it is rather difficult
to integrate Epicurean hedonism into the overall schema of the use of
pleasures proposed by M. Foucault. Be this as it may, the Epicureans did
make use of spiritual exercises, for instance the examination of conscience. As
we have said, however, these practices are not based on the norms of nature
or universal reason, because for the Epicureans the formation of the world is
the result of mere chance. Nevertheless, here again, this spiritual exercise
cannot be defined simply as culture of the self, a relationship of the self to
the self, or pleasure that can be found in one's own self. The Epicurean was
not afraid to admit that he needed other things besides himself in order to
satisfy his desires and to experience pleasure. He needed bodily nourishment
and the pleasures of love, but he also required a physical theory of the
universe, in order to eliminate the fear of the gods and of death. He needed
the company of the other members of the Epicurean school, so that he could
find happiness in mutual affection. Finally, he needed the imaginative
contemplation of an infinite number of universes in the infinite void, in order
to experience what Lucretius calls tlivi11a vo/uptt1s et lwm1r. Mct roJorus, n

in the cosmos: "Remember that, although born mortal with a limited
life-span, you have risen in thought as far as the eternity and infinity of
things, and that you have seen everything that has been, and everything that
shall be." 12 In Epicureanism, there is an extraordinary reversal of perspective.
Precisely because existence seems to the Epicurean to be pure chance,
inexorably unique, he greets life like a kind of miracle, a gratuitous,
unexpected gift of nature, and existence for him is a wonderful celebration.
Let us consider another example to i llustrate the differences between our
interpretations of the "care of the self." In an interesting article entitled
" Ecriture de soi," 13 M. Foucault took as his point of departure a remarkable
text concerning the therapeutic value of writing, which I had studied in
Exercices spirituels. 14 According to this text, St Antony used to advise his
disciples to write down their actions and the emotions of their souls, as if they
were going to make them known to others . "Let writing take the place of the
eyes of other people," Antony used to say . This anecdote leads M. Foucault
to reflect on the various forms adopted in antiquity by what he calls the
"writing of the self." In particular, he examines the literary genre of
hypomnemata, which one could translate as "spiritual notebooks," in which
one writes down other people's thoughts, which may serve for the edification
of the person writing them down. Foucault15 describes the goal of this exercise
in the following terms: the point is to "capture what-has-already-been-said
[capter le dijti-dit]," and to "collect what one may have heard or read, with a
view to nothing less than the constitution of the self." He then asks himself,
"How can we be placed in the presence of our selves with the help of ageless
discourses, picked up from any old place?" And he replies as follows: "this
exercise was supposed to allow one to turn back towards the past. The
contribution of the hypomnemala is one of the means by which one detaches
the soul from worries about the future, in order to inflect it toward meditation
on the past. " Both in Epicurean and in Stoic ethics, Foucault thinks he
perceives the refusal of a mental attitude directed toward the future, and the
tendency to accord a positive value to the possession of a past which one can
enjoy autonomously and without worries.
It seems to me that this is a mistaken interpretation. It is true that the
Epicureans - and on{v the Epicureans - did consider the memory of pleasant
moments in the past as one of the principal sources of pleasure, but this has
nothing to do with the meditation on "what-has-already-been-said" practiced
in hypomnemala. Rather, as we saw above, 16 Stoics and Epicureans had in
common an attitude which consisted in liberating oneself not only from
worries about the future, but also from the burden of the past, in order to
concentrate on the present moment; in order either to enjoy it, or to act
within it. From this point of view, neither the Stoics nor even the Epicureans
accorded a pos i t i ve value to the past. The fundamental philosophic attitude
consisted in li1•l1tR ;,, tht flrtsmt, and in p ossessi n g not the past, but th e

210

present. That the Epicureans also attached a great deal of importance to the
thoughts formulated by their predecessors is a wholly different matter. But
although hypomnemata deal with what has already been said, they do not deal
with just anything "already said," the only merit of which would be that it is
a part of the past. Rather, it is because one recognizes in this "thing already
said" - which usually consisted in the dogmas of the school's founding
members - that which reason itself has to say to the present. It is because one
recognizes, in the dogmas of Epicurus or Chrysippus, an ever-present value,
precisely because they are the very expression of reason. In other words, when
one writes or notes something down, it is not an alien thought one is making
one's own. Rather, one is utilizing formulae considered as apt to actualize
what is already present within the reason of the person writing, and bring it
to life.
According to M. Foucault, this method made a deliberate attempt to be
eclectic, and therefore implied a personal choice; this then explains the
"constitution of the self."
Writing as a personal exercise, done by oneself and for oneself, is an art
of disparate truth; more precisely, it is a way of combining the
traditional authority of what has already been said, with the singularity
of the truth which asserts itself in it, and the particularity of the
circumstances which determine its utilization.
In fact, however, personal choice is not to be found in eclecticism, at least for
the Stoics and Epicureans. Eclecticism is only used for converting beginners.
At that stage, anything goes. For instance, Foucault finds an example of
eclecticism in the Letters to Lucilius, in which the Stoic Seneca quotes sayings
of Epicurus. The goal of these letters, however, is to convert Lucilius, and to
cause him to begin to lead a moral life. The utilization of Epicurus appears
only in the first Letters, and soon disappears. 17 On the contrary, personal
'
choice in fact intervenes only when one adheres exclusively to a precise form
of life, be it Stoicism or Epicureanism, considered as in conformity with
reason. It is only in the New Academy - in the person of Cicero, for instance
- that a personal choice is made according to what reason considers as most
likely at a given moment.
It is thus not the case, as Foucault maintains,18 that the individual forges a
spiritual identity for himself by writing down and re-reading disparate
thoughts. In the first place, as we have seen, these thoughts are not d isparate,
but chosen because of their coherence. Secondly, and most importantly, the
point is not to forge oneself a spiritual identity by writing, but rather to
liberate oneself from one's individuality, in o rder to raise oneself up to
u n i versal ity. It is thus in c o r r ec t to speak of "wri t i n g of' the 11el f": not on ly is
it n o t the case t ha t one 11write11 onc11t•lf, " hut wh111 iN more , it iN not t he t�llsc

that writing constitutes the self. Writing, like the other spiritual exercises,
changes the level of the self. and universalizes it. The miracle of this exercise,
carried out in solitude, is that it allows its practitioner to accede to the
universality of reason within the confines of space and time.
For the monk Antony, the therapeutic value of writing consisted precisely
in its universalizing power. Writing, says Antony, takes the place of other
people's eyes. A person writing feels he is being watched; he is no longer
alone, but is a part of the silently present human community. When one
formulates one's personal acts in writing, one is taken up by the machinery
of reason, logic, and universality. What was confused and subjective becomes
thereby objective.
To summarize: what Foucault calls "practices of the selr' do indeed
correspond, for the Platonists as well as for the Stoics, to a movement of
conversion toward the self. One frees oneself from exteriority, from personal
attachment to exterior objects, and from the pleasures they may provide. One
observes oneself, to determine whether one has made progress in this exercise.
One seeks to be one's own master, to possess oneself, and find one's happiness
in freedom and inner independence. I concur on all these points. I do think,
however, that this movement of interiorization is inseparably linked to another
movement, whereby one rises to a higher psychic level, at which one
encounters another kind of exteriorization, another relationship with "the
exterior." This is a new way of being-in-the-world, which consists in
becoming aware of oneself as a part of nature, and a portion of universal
reason. At this point, one no longer lives in the usual, conventional human
world, but in the world of nature. As we have seen above,19 one is then
practicing "physics" as a spiritual exercise.
In this way, one identifies oneself with an "Other": nature, or universal
reason, as it is present within each individual. This implies a radical
transformation of perspective, and contains a universalist, cosmic dimension,
upon which, it seems to me, M. FoU<.-ault did not sufficiently insist.
lnteriorization is a going beyond oneself; it is universalization.
The preceding remarks are not intended to be relevant only to an historical
analysis of ancient philosophy. They are also an attempt at defining an ethical
model which modern man can discover in antiquity. What I am afraid of is
that, by focusing his interpretation too exclusively on the culture of the self,
the care of the self, and conversion toward the self - more generally, by
defining his ethical model as an aesthetics of existence - M. Foucault is
propounding a culture of the self which is too aesthetic. In other words, this
may be a new form of Dandyism, late twentieth-century style. This, however,
deserves a more attentive study than I am able to devote to it here. Personally,
I bel ieve firmly - albeit perhaps naively - that it is possible for modern man
to l i ve, nor ns a Rage (.ffJphos) - most of the ancients did not hold this to be
possible hut '' " 11 1m1c t i 1 ioner of t he e ver-fragile e.\'ercisc of wisdom. This can

be attempted, starting out from the lived experience of the concrete, living,
and perceiving subject, under the triple form defined, as we saw above, by
Marcus Aurelius:

1 as an effort to practice objectivity of judgment;

2

as an effort to live according to justice, in the service of the human

3

as an effort to become aware of our situation as a part of the universe. Such

community; and
an exercise of wisdom will thus be an attempt to render oneself open to the
universal.
More specifically, I think modern man can practice the spiritual exercises of
antiquity, at the same time separating them from the philosophical or mythic
discourse which came along with them. The same spiritual exercise can, in fact,

be

justified by extremely diverse philosophical discourses. These latter are

nothing but clumsy attem p ts, coming after the fact, to describe and j ustify inner
experiences whose existential density is not, in the last analysis, susceptible of any
attempt at theorization or systemati7.ation. Stoics and Epicureans, for example for completely different reasons - urged their disciples to concentrate their
attention on the present moment, and free themselves from worries about the
future as well as the burden of the past Whoever concretely practices this
exercise, however, sees the universe with new eyes, as if he were seeing it for the
first time. In the enjoyment of the pure present, he discovers the mystery and
splendor of existence. At such moments, as Nietzsche said,20 we say yes "not only
to ourselves, but to all existence." It is therefore not necessary, in order to practice
these exercises, to believe in the Stoics' nature or universal reason. Rather, as one
practices them, one lives concretely according to reason. In the words of Marcus
Aurelius:21 "Although everything happens at random, don't you,

too,

act

at random. " In this way, we <.-an accede concretely to the universality of
the cosmic perspective, and the wonderful mystery of the presence of the
universe.

"Only the Present is our Happiness" :
The Value o f the Present Instant in
Goethe and in Ancient Philosophy

"Then the spirit looks neither ahead nor behind. Only the present is our
happiness." 1 In this verse from Goethe's Set'ond Fa11st, we find an expression of
the art of concentrating on and recognizing the value of the present instant. It
corresponds to an experience of time which was lived with particular intensity in
such ancient philosophies as Epicureanism and Stoicism, and in what follows we
shall

be especially concerned with this type of experience. We ought not,

however, to forget the literary context in which these lines arc spoken, the
meaning they take on within the context of the

Second Faw;/, and, more generally,

within the work of Goethe. In the proces.o;, we will find that Goethe himself is a
remarkable witness for the type of experience we have mentioned.
The verses quoted mark one of the climaxes of the Second Fa11s1; a moment when
Faust seems to reach the culminating point of his "quest for the h i ghest existencc." 2
Beside him, on the throne which he has had built for her, sits Helen, whom he had
evoked in the first act, after a terrifying journey to the . realm of the Mothers, in
order to amuse the emperor; but had since fallen hopeless ly in love with her:
Has the Source of Beauty, overflowing its banks,
Flowed into the deepest recesses of my being? . . .
To you I dedicate the stirring of all strength,

The essence too of passion;
To you, affection, love, worship, and madness.3

It is llcll·n for whom he has searched throughout the second a c t , throughout

Themes

centaur Chiron, and with Manto the Sibyl, and finally, it is she who, in
the third act, has come to take refuge in the medieval fortress perhaps Mistra in the Peloponnese - of which he appears as the lord and
master.
It is then that the extraordinary encounter takes place between Faust
and Helen; Faust, who, although he appears in the guise of a medieval
knight, is really the personification of modern man, and Helen, who, although
she is evoked in the form of the heroine of the Trojan Wa r , is, in fact, the
figure of beauty itself, and in the last analysis of the beauty of nature.
With consummate mastery, Goethe has succeeded in bringing these figures
and symbols to life, in such a way that the encounter between Faust
and Helen is as highly-charged with emotion as the meeting between two
lovers, as laden with historical significance as the meeting between
two epochs, and as fu ll of meaning as the encounter of a human being with
his destiny.
The choice of poetic form is used very skillfully to represent both the
dialogue of the two lovers and the encounter between two historical epochs.
Since the beginning of the third act, Helen had been speaking in the
manner of ancient tragedy, and her words were set to the rhythm of iambic
trimeters, while the chorus of captive Trojan women responded to her in
strophe a nd antistrophc. Now, however, at the moment when Helen meets
Faust and hears the watchman Lynccus speak in rhymed distichs, she is
astonished and charmed by this unknown poetic form:
No sooner has one word struck the car
Than another comes to caress its predccessor.4
The birth of Helen's love for Faust will, moreover, express itself in the
same rhymed distichs, which Faust begins and Helen finishes, inventing the
rhyme each time. As she learns this new poetic form, Helen learns, as
Phorkyas says, to spell out the alphabet of love.; Helen begins:
Tell me, then, how can I, too, speak so prettily?
"That's easy enough," replies Faust;
It must come from the heart,
And when one's breast with longing overflows,
One looks around, and asks llelt'n:

who

sh11ll enjoy i i w il h

us.

"Only the Present is our Happiness "

219

Faust begins again:
Now the spirit looks not forward, nor behind
Only the present Helen:

is

our

happiness.

Faust: It i s our treasure, our highest prize, our possession
and our pledge.
But who confirms it?
Helen:

My hand.6

The love duet ends, for the moment, with this sign of Helen's yielding, and
the rhyme-play thus ends in a "confinnatio" which is now no longer the echo
of a rhyme, but the gift of a hand. Faust and Helen then fall silent, and
embrace each other without a word, while the chorus, adopting the tone of an
epithalamion, describes their embrace. Then the dialogue of love - and also of
rhyming verses - starts up again between Faust and Helen, and causes us to
live a moment of such intensity and pregnancy that both time and the drama
seem to stop. Helen says:
I feel myself so far away and yet so close;
And I say only too gladly: Here Am I! Here!
Faust: I can scarcely breathe; my words tremble and falter;
This is a dream, and time and place have disappeared .
Helen: It seems to me that I am broken down with age,
and yet I am so new;
Mingled with you, I am faithful to the Unknown.
Faust: Don't rack your brains about your destiny, so unique!
Existence is a duty, be it only for an instant.7
Here the drama seems to stop. We think that Helen and Faust have nothing
left to desire, fulfilled as they are by each other's presence. But Mephistopheles,
who, in order to adapt himself to the Greek world, has taken on the monstrous
mask of Phorkyas, breaks off this perfect moment by announcing the menacing
approach of the troops of Menelaus, and Faust reproaches him for his ill-timed
interruption. The marvelous instant has now disappeared, but the dispositions of
Faust anJ of I lclcn will still be reflected in the deS<..Tiption of the ideal Arcadia
in which F11 UNI 1111 J H e le n arc to engender Euphorion, the genius of poetry.

Themes

The dialogue we have quoted may be understood at several levels. First and
foremost, it is the dialogue between two lovers, who, as such, resem ble all lovers
everywhere. Faust and Helen are two lovers absorbed by the living presence of
the beloved: they forget everything - both past and future - which is other than
this presence. Their excess of happiness

gives

them an impression of dreamlike

unreality: time and space disappear. We are entering the unknown, and it is the
moment of love fulfilled.
On a second level of interpretation, however, the dialogue takes p lace
between Faust and Helen as symbolic figures, representing, on the one hand,
modem man in his ceaseless striving, and on the other, ancient beauty in its
soothing presence; both are miraculously reunited by the magic of poetry,
which abolishes the centuries. In this dialogue, Faust as modern man tries to
make Helen forget her past, so that she may be wholly in the present instant,
which she is incapable of understanding. She feels herself to be so distant and
yet so close, abandoned by l i fe and yet in the process of rebirth, living in
Faust, mingled with him, and trusting in the unknown . Faust asks her not to
reflect upon her strange destiny, but to accept the new existence which is
being offered to her. In this dialogue between two symbolic figures, Helen
becomes "modernized," if one may say so; as she adopts rhyme, the symbol
of modern interiority, she has doubts, and reflects upon her destiny. At the
same time, Faust becomes "antiquated": he speaks as a man of antiquity,
when he urges Helen to concentrate on the present moment, and not to lose
it in hesitant reflection on the past and the future. As Goethe said in a letter
to Zel ter, this was the characteristic feature of ancient life and art: to know
how to live in the present, and to know what he called "the healthiness of the
moment . " In antiquity, says Goethe, the instant was "pregnant;" in other
words, filled with meaning, but it was also lived in al l its reality and the
fullness of its richness, su fficient unto i tself. We no longer know how to live
in the present, continues Goethe. For us, the ideal is in the future, and can
only be the object of a sort of nostalgic desire, while the present is considered
trivial and banal. We no longer know how to profit from the present; we no
longer know - as the Greeks did - how to act in the present, and u pon the
present.8 Indeed , if Faust speaks to Helen as a man of the ancient world, it is
precisely because the presence of Helen - that is, the presence of ancient
beauty - reveals to him what presence itself is: the presence of the world,
"That splend id feeling of the present"
Goethe wrote in the

(He"liches Gefiih l der Gegenwart) as

East- West Divan.9

This, finally, is the reason why the dialogue can be understood at a thi rd
level . Here, it is no longer the dialogue of two lovers, nor of two historica l
figures, but rather the dialogue of man with himself. The encoun ter w i t h

Helen is not only the encounter with ancient beauty em a nat i ng from nature;

it is also the encounter w it h n l i v i n g w isdom 1md art of living: that

had wagered with Mephistopheles that he would never say to an instant:
"Stay, you are so beautiful!" But now, following after humble Gretchen, it is
ancient, noble Helen who reveals to him the splendor of being - that is, of
the present instant - and teaches him to say yes to the world and to himself.
We must now define the ancient experience of time which we saw expressed
in the above-quoted verses from Faust. Basing ourselves on the letter from
Goethe to Zeller we cited above, we might think that we have to do with a
generalized, common experience of ancient man, and that it was natural for
ancient man to be familiar with what Goethe calls the "healthiness of the
moment." Moreover, following Goethe, many historians and philosophers,
from Oswald Spengler10 to the logician Hintikka, 11 have alluded to the fact
that the Greeks "lived in the present moment" more than did the repre­
sentatives of other cultures. In his book Die Zauberflote,12 Siegfried Morenz
gives a good summary of this conception: "No one has better characterized
the particular nature of Greece than Goethe . . . in the dialogue between
Faust and Helen: ' . . . then the spirit looks neither backwards nor ahead. Only
the present is our happiness. ' "
We must certainly agree that the Greeks in general gave particular attention
to the present moment, and this attention could take on several different
ethical and artistic meanings. Popular wisdom advised people both to be
content with the present, and to know how to utilize it. Being content with
the present meant, on the one hand, being content with earthly existence.
This is what Goethe admired in ancient art, particularly in funerary art,
where the deceased was represented not with his eyes raised toward the
heavens, but in the act of living his daily life. On the other hand, knowing
how to utilize the present meant knowing how to recognize and seize the
favorable and decisive instant (kairos). Kairos designated all the possibilities
contained within a given moment: a good general, for example, knows how to
strike at the opportune kairos, and sculptors fix in marble the most significant
kairos of the scene which they wish to bring to life.
It does seem, then, that the Greeks paid particular attention to the present
moment. This, however, does not justify us in ima gining - as did Winckel­
mann, Goethe, and Holderlin - the existence of an idealized Greece, the
citizens of which, because they lived in the present moment, were perpetually
bathed in beauty and serenity. As a matter of fact, people in antiquity were
just as filled with anguish as we are today, and ancient poetry often preserves
the echo of this anguish, which sometimes goes as far as despair. Like us, the
ancients bore the burden of the past, the uncertainty of the future, and the
fear of death. Indeed, it was for this human anguish that ancient philosophies
- p a rti c ul a r l y F.picurcanism and Stoicism - sought to provide a remedy.
These philo!IUllhics were therapies, intended to provide a cure for anguish,
and t o hrintc f'rt•t•dom and sel f-mastery , and their goal was to allow people to

222

Themes

free themselves from the past and the futu re, so that they could live within
the present. Here we have to do with an experience of time wholly different
from the common, general experience we have been describing. As we shall
see, this experience corresponds precisely to that expressed in the verses from

Faust: "Only the present is our happiness . . . don't think about your destiny .
Existence is a duty . " We are dealing with a philosophical conversion,
implying a voluntary, radical transformation of one's way of living and
looking at the world. This is the true "healthiness of the moment," which
leads to serenity.
Despite the profound differences between Epicurean and Stoic doctrine, we
find an extraordinary structural analogy between the experiences of time as it was
lived in both schools. This analogy will perhaps allow us to glimpse a certain
common experience of the present underlying their doctrinal divergences. We
can define this analogy as follows: both Epicureanism and Stoicism privilege the

present, to the detriment of the past and above all of the future. They posit as

an axiom that happiness can only be found in the present, that one instant of
happiness is equivalent to an eternity of happiness , and that happiness can and
must be found immediately, here and now. Both Epicureanism and Stoicism
invite us to rcsituate the present instant within the perspective of the cosmos, and
to accord infinite value to the slightest moment of existence.
To begin with Epicureanism: it is a therapy of anguish , and a philosophy
which seeks, above all, to procure peace of mind. Its goal is consequently to
liberate mankind from everything that is a cause of anguish for the soul: the
belief that the gods are concerned with mankind; the fear of post-mortem
punishment; the worries and pain brought about by unsatisfied desires; and
the moral uneasiness caused by the concern to act out of perfect purity of
intention .
Epicureanism does away with all this. With regard to the gods, it affirms
that they themselves live in perfect tranquillity . They are not troubled by the
worry of producing or governing the universe, since the latter is the result of
a fortuitous coming together of eternally existent atoms. With regard to death,
Epicureanism asserts that the soul docs not survive the body, and that death
is not an event within life. With regard to desires, it affirms that they trouble
us to the extent that they are artificial and useless. We must reject all those
desires which are neither natural nor necessary, and satisfy - with prudence
- those of our desires which are natural but not necessary. Above all, we are
to satisfy those desires which are indispensable for the continuation of our
existence. As for moral worries, they will be completely appea.o;ed once we
realize that man, like all other living beings, is always motivated by pleasure.
If we seek for wisdom, this is simply because it brings peace of mind: in other
words, a pleasurable state.
What Epicureanism proposes is a fom1 of wisdom, which tc11chcs Uli how
to relax and to su pp re 11 s our worries. This only appc11rs to be easy, mcll'covcr;

"Only the Present is our Happiness "

223

for we must renounce a great deal, in order that we may desire only that
which we are certain of obtaining, and submit our desires to the judgment of
reason. What is required, in fact, is a total transformation o f our lives, and
one of the principal aspects of this transformation is the change of our attitude
toward time. According to Epicureanism, senseless people - that is, the
majority of mankind - are tormented by vast, hollow desires which have to
do with wealth, glory, power, and the unbridled pleasures of the flesh. 13 What
is characteristic of all these desires is that they cannot be satisfied in the
present. This is why, for the Epicureans,
senseless people live in hope for the future, and since this cannot be
certain, they are consumed by fear and anxiety. Their torment is the
most intense when they realize too late that they have striven in vain
after money or power or glory, for they do not derive any pleasure from
the things which, inflamed with hope, they had undertaken such great
labors to procure. H

According to an Epicurean saying, "The life of a foolish man is fearful and
unpleasant; it is swept totally away into the future." 15 Thus, Epicurean
wisdom proposes a radical transformation, which must be active at each
instant of life, of mankind's attitude toward time. We must, it teaches, learn
how to enjoy the pleasure of the present, without letting ourselves be
distracted from it. If the past is unpleasant to us, we are to avoid thinking
about it, and we must not think about the future, insofar as the idea of it
provokes in us fears or unbridled expectations. Only thoughts about what is
pleasant - of pleasure, whether past or future - are to be allowed into the
present moment, especially when we are trying to compensate for current
suffering. This transformation presupposes a specific conception of pleasure,
peculiar to Epicureanism, according to which the quality of pleasure depends
neither on the quantity of desires it satisfies, nor on the length of time it lasts.
The quality of pleasure does not depend on the quantity of desires it
satisfies. The best and most intense pleasure is that which is mixed to the
least extent with worry, and which is the most certain to ensure peace of
mind. It can therefore be procured by the satisfaction of natural and necessary
desires; that is, those desires which are essential and necessary for the
preservation of existence. Now, such desires can easily be satisfied, without
our having to rely on the future for them, and without our being exposed to
the worry and uncertainty of lengthy pursuit. "Thanks be to blessed nature,
who made necessary things easy to obtain, and things which are hard to obtain
unnecessary. " 111
What causes us to think about the past or the future are such illnesses of
the sou l ll N 1 hc h uman passions, desires for wealth, power, or depravity; but
the purc111 , 11111111 i n 1 cni;c pleasure can easily be obtained within the present.

224

Themes

Not only does pleasure not depend upon the quantity of satisfied desires, but above all - it does not depend upon duration. It has no need to be long-lasting
in order to be perfect: "An infinite period of time could not cause us more
pleasure than can be derived from this one, which we can see is finite." 17
"Finite time and infinite time bring us the same pleasure, if we measure its
limits by reason. " 18 This may seem paradoxical, but it is founded on a
theoretical conception. As the Stoics were to repeat, a tiny circle is no more
of a circle than a large one. 19 The Epicureans thought of pleasure as a reality
in and for itself, not situated within the category of time. Aristotle had said
that pleasure is total and complete at each moment of its duration, and that
its prolongation does not change its essence.2° For the Epicureans, a practical
attitude is joined to this theoretical representation: if pleasure limits itself to
that which procures perfect peace of mind, it attains a summit which cannot
be surpassed, and it is impossible for it to by increased by duration. In the
words of Guyau: "In enjoyment, there is a kind of inner plenitude and
over-abundance which makes it independent of time, as well as of everything
else. True pleasure bears its infinity within itself." 2 1
Thus, pleasure is wholly within the present moment, and we need not wait
for anything from the future to increase it. Everything we have been saying
so far could be summed up in the following verses from Horace: "Let the soul
which is happy with the present learn to hate to worry about what lies
ahead . " 22 The happy mind does not look towards the future. If we limit our
desires in a reasonable way, we can be happy right now. Not only can we be
happy, but we mus/: happiness must be found immediately, here and now,
and in the present. Instead of reflecti n g about our lives as a whole, calculating
our hopes and worries, we must seize happiness within the present moment.
The matter is urgent; in the words of an Epicurean saying:
We are only born once - twice is not allowed - and it is necessary
that we shall be no more, for all eternity; and yet you, who are not
master of tomorrow, you keep on putting off your joy? Yet life is vainly
consumed in these delays, and each of us dies without ever having
known peace. 23
Once again, we find the echo of this idea in Horace: "While we are talking,
jealous time has fled. So seize the day [carpe diem], and put no trust
in tomorrow." H Horace's carpe diem is by no means, as is often believed,
the advice of a sensualist playboy; on the contrary, it is an invitation
to conversion. We are invited to become aware of the vanity of our immense­
ly vain desires, at the same time as of the imminence of death, the
uniqueness of life, and the uniqueness of the present instant. From this
perspective, each i nstant a ppears as a marvclom1 gift wh ich fil l H itR recipient
w i th grat itude:

"Only the Present is our Happiness "

225

Believe that each new day that dawns will be the last for you:
Then each unexpected hour shall come to you as a delightful gift. 25
There is perhaps an echo here of the Epicurean Philodemus: "Receive each
additional moment of time in a manner appropriate to its value; as if one were
having an incredible stroke of luck . " 26
We have already encountered the Epicureans' feelings of gratitude and
astonishment, in the con tex t of the miraculous coin cidence between the needs
of living beings and the facilities provided for them by nature. The secret of
Epicurean joy and serenity is to live each instant as if it were the last, but also
as if it were the first. We experience the same grateful astonishment when we
accept the instant as though it were unexpected, or by greeting it as e nti rely
new: "If the whole world were appear to mortals now, for the first time; if it
was suddenly and unexpectedly exposed to their view; what could one think
of more marvelous than these things, and which mankind would less have
dared to believe?" 27 In the last analysis, the secret of Epicurean joy and
serenity is the experience of infinite pleasure provided by the consciousness
of existence, even if it be only for a moment. In the words of an Epicurean
saying: "The cry of the flesh is: Not to be hungry, not to be thirsty, not to
be cold. Whoever has these things, and hopes to keep on having them, can
rival in happiness with Zeus himself." 28 The lack of hunger and thirst is thus
the condition for being able to continue to exist, being conscious of existing,
and enjoying this consciousness of existing. God has nothing more than this.
It could be objected that God's pleasure consists in his knowledge that he has
the happiness of existing forever. Not so, replies Epicurus; for the pleasure of
one instant of existence is just as total and complete as a pleasure of infinite
duration, and man is just as immortal as God, because death is not a part of
life.2'1

In order to show that one single instant of happiness is enough to give such
infinite pleasure, the Epicureans practiced telling themselves each day: "I
have had all the pleasure I could have expected." In the words of Horace: "He
will be master of himself and live joyfully who can say, every day: 'I have
lived.' " ·10 Seneca also takes up this Epicurean theme:
When we are about to go to sleep, let us say in joyous cheerfulness: " I
have lived; I have travelled the route that fortune had assigned to me."
If God should grant us tomorrow as well, let us accept it joyfully. That
person is most happy a n d in tranquil possession of himself who awaits
tomorrow without worries.31 Whoever says: "I have lived", gets up every
day to receive unexpected riches.32
We c11 n Rhm sec here the role played in Epicureanism by the thought of
deat h . T11 1111 y , cn•ry c \•cn ing: " I have lived ," is to say "my life is over." It is

226

Themes

to practice the same exercise as that which consists in saying: "Today will be
the last day of my life." Yet it is precisely this exercise of becoming aware of
life's finitude which reveals the infinite value of the pleasure of existing within
the present instant. From the point of view of death, the mere fact of existing
- even if only for a moment - seems to be of infinite value, and gives us
pleasure of infinite intensity. Only once we have become aware of the fact that
we have already - in one instant of existence - had everything there was to
be had, can we say with equanimity: "my life is over."
It is here, moreover, that the cosmic perspective comes into play. The
Epicureans had their own particular vision of the universe. As Lucretius
put it: thanks to the doctrine of Epicurus, which explained the origin of
the universe by the fall of atoms in a void, the walls of the world burst
open for the Epicurean: he saw all things come into being within the
immense void,33 and traversed the immensity of the all. Alternatively, he
exclaims, in the words of Metrodorus: "Remember that, born a mortal,
with a l imited life-span, you have risen up in soul to eternity and the
infinity of things, and that you have seen all that has been and all that shall
be." 34 Here again, we encounter the contrast between finite and infinite time.
Within finite time, the sage grasps all that takes place within infinite time, or
as Leon Robin puts it in his commentary on Lucretius: "The sage places
himself within the immutability of eternal Nature, which is independent of
time." 35
Thus, the sage perceives the totality of the cosmos within his consciousness
of the fact of existing. Nature gives him everything within an instant, and
since she has already given him everything, she has nothing left to give him,
as she says in Lucretius' poem: "You must always expect the same things,
even though the span of your life should triumph over all the ages; nay, even
were you never to die." ·11•
The fundamental attitude that the Stoic must maintain at each instant of his
life is one of attention, vigilance, and continuous tension, concentrated
upon each and every moment, in order not to miss anything which is contrary
to reason. We find an excellent description of this attitude in Marcus
Aurelius:
Here is what is enough for you:
1 . the judgment you are bringing to bear at this moment upon reality,
as long as it is objective;
2. the action you are carrying out at this moment, as long as it is
accomplished in the service of the human community; and
3. the inner disposition in which you find yo u rse l f at this m om e n t , as
long as it i s a d isposition of j o y in the face of the conj unction of events

caused by cx1 rnncom1 cnus11li t y . 1 1

"Only the Present is our Happiness "

227

Thus, Marcus used to train himself to concentrate upon the p resent moment;
that is, upon what he was thinking, doing, and feeling within the present
instant. "This is enough for you," he tells himself, and the expression has a
double meaning:
It is enough to keep you busy; you have no need to think about anything
else; and

2 It is enough to make you happy; there is no need to seek for anything else.
This is the spiritual exercise Marcus himself calls "delimiting the present . " 38
Delimiting the present means turning one's attention away from the past and
the future, in order to concentrate it upon what one is in the process of doing.
The present of which Marcus speaks is a present delimited by human
consciousness. The Stoics distinguished two ways of defining the present.39 The
first consisted in understanding the present as the limit between the past and the
future: from this point of view, no present time ever actually exists, since time is
infinitely divisible. This, however, is an abstract, quasi-mathematical division,
with the present being reduced to an infinitesimal instant.
The second way consisted in defining the present with reference to human
consciousness. In this case, the present represented a certain "thickness" of
time, corresponding to the attention-span of lived consciousness. When
Marcus advises us to "delimit the present," he is talking about this lived
present, relative to consciousness. This is an important point: the present is
defined by its reference to man's thoughts and actions.
The present su ffices for our happiness, because it is the only thing which
belongs to us, and depends upon us. For the Stoics, it was essential to
distinguish between what does and does not depend upon us. The past does
not belong to us, since it is definitively fixated , and the future does not
depend on us, because it docs not yet exist. Only the present depends on us,
and it is therefore the only thing which can be either good or bad, since it is
the only thing which depends upon our will. Since the past and the future do
not depend on us, they do not come under the category of moral good or evil,
and must therefore be indifferent to us.�0 It is a waste of time to worry about
what is long gone, or what will perhaps never occur; we must therefore
"delimit the present." "All the happiness you are trying to achieve by long,
roundabout ways: you can have it all right now . . . . that is, if you leave
everything past behind you, entrust the future to providence, and if you
arrange the present in accordance with p iety and j ustice. " �1
Elsewhere, Marcus describes the exercise of delimiting the present in the
following terms:
i f you licpnrntc from you rsel f, that is, from you r thought . . . everything

you h11 \'l' 1111 i d or done in the past, everything that disturbs you abou t

228

Themes

the future; all that . . . attaches itself to you against your will . . . if you
separate from yourself the future and the past, and apply yourself
exclusively to living the life that you are living - that is to say, the
present - you can live all the time that remains to you until your death,
in calm, benevolence, and serenity.0
Seneca describes the same exercise as follows:
Two things must be cut short:43 the fear of the future and the memory
of past discomfort; the one does not concern me any more, and the other
does not concern me yet.44
The sage enjoys the present without depending on the future . . . .
Liberated from the burden of worries which torture the mind, he does
not hope for or desire anything. He does not plunge forward into the
unknown, for he is happy with what he has [i.e. the present, which is
all that belongs to us]. And don't believe that he is content with not very
much, for what he has is everything.45
Here we witness the same transformation of the present that we encountered
in Epicureanism. In the present, say the Stoics, we have everything, and only
the present is our happiness. There are two reasons why the present is
sufficient for our happiness: in the first place, Stoic happiness - like
Epicurean pleasure - is complete at every instant and does not increase over
time. The second reason is that we already possess the whole of reality within
the present instant, and even infinite duration could not give us more than
what we have right now.
Happiness, then - that is, for the S toics, moral action or virtue - is always
total and complete, at each moment of its duration. Like pleasure for the
Epicurean sage, the happiness of the Stoic sage is perfect. It lacks nothing,
just as a circle, whether it is large or small, still remains a circle. The same is
true of a propitious or opportune moment or favorable opportunity: it is an
instant, the perfection of which depends not on its duration, but rather on its
quality, and the harmony which exists between one's exterior situation and
the possibilities that one has.46 Happiness is nothing more nor less than that
instant in which man is wholly in accord with nature.
Just as was the case for the Epicureans, one instant of happiness is,
according to the Stoics, equivalent to an eternity. In the words of Chrysippus:
"If a person has wisdom for one instant, he is no less happy than he who
possesses it for an eternity. " 47 Similarly, as for the Epicureans, so for the
Stoics: we will never be h appy if we arc no t so right now . I t ' s now or never.
The matter is urgent : we must hurry, for de at h is imminent, 1md nil we

of no use. What is needed is the immediate transformation of our way of
thinking, of acting, and of accepting events. We must think in accordance with
truth, act in accordance with justice, and lovingly accept what comes to pass. In
the words of Marcus Aurelius: "How easy it is to find oneself, right away, in a
state of perfect peace of mind." 411 In other words, it is enough just to want it.
For the Stoics, as for the Epicureans, it is the imminence of death which
gives the present instant its value. "We must carry out each action of our lives
as if it were the last." 49 This is the secret of concentration on the present
moment: we are to give it all its seriousness, value, and splendor, in order to
show up the vanity of all that we pursue with so much worry: all of which,
in the end, will be taken away from us by death. We must live each day with
a consciousness so acute, and an attention so intense, that we can say to
ourselves each evening: "I have lived; I have actualized my life, and have had
all that I could expect from life." In the words of Seneca: "He has peace of
mind who has lived his entire life every day. 11 5o
We have just seen the first reason why the present alone is sufficient for
our happiness: namely, that one instant of happiness is equivalent to a whole
eternity of happiness. The second reason is that, within one instant, we
possess the totality of the universe. The present instant is fleeting - Marcus
insists strongly on this point51 - but even within this flash, as Seneca says,
" we can proclaim, along with God: 'all this belongs to me. ' 1 1 52 The instant is
our only point of contact with reality, yet it offers us the whole of reality;
precisely because it is a passage and a metamorphosis, it allows us to
participate in the overall movement of the event of the world, and the reality
of the world's coming-to-be.
In order to understand the preceding, we must bear in mind what moral
action, virtue, and wisdom meant for the Stoics. Moral good - for the Stoics,
the only kind of good there is - has a cosmic dimension: it is the
harmonization of the reason within us with the reason w�ich guides the
cosmos, and produces the chain of causes and effect which makes up fate. At
each moment, we must harmonize our judgment, action, and desires with
universal reason. In particular, we must joyfully accept the conj unction of
events which results from the course of nature. At each instant, we must
therefore resituate ourselves within the perspective of universal reason, so
that, at each instant, our consciousness may become a cosmic consciousness.
Thus, if one lives in accord with universal reason, at each instant his
consciousness expands into the infinity of the cosmos, and the entire universe
is present to him. For the Stoics, this is possible because there is a total
mixture and mutual implication of everything with everything else: Chrysip­
pus, for example, spoke of a drop of wine being mixed with the whole of the
sea, and spreading to the entire world.53 "He who sees the present moment
secs a l l thnr hns happened from all eternity, and all that will happen
1 1 ��
t h rouicho u l i n fi n i l l' l i me.
This explains the attention given to each current

230

Themes

event, and to what is happening to us at each instant. Each event implies the
entire world: "Whatever happens to you has been prepared for you from all
eternity, and the mutual linkage of cause and effect has, from all eternity,
woven together your existence and the occurrence of this event." 55
One could speak here of a mystical dimension of Stoicism . At each moment
and every instant, we must say "yes" to the universe; that is, to the will of
universal reason . We must want that which universal reason wants: that is,
the present instant, exactly as it is. Some Christian mystics have also
described their state as a continuous consent to the will of God . Marcus, for
his part, cries out: "I say to the universe: 'I love along with you.' " 56 We have
here a profound feeling of participation and identification; of belonging to a
whole which transcends our individual limits, and gives us a feeling of
intimacy with the universe. For Seneca, the sage plunges himself into the
whole of the universe ( t o ti se inserens mundo).57
Because the sage lives within his consciousness of the world, the world is
constantly present to him. In Stoicism, even more than in Epicureanism, the
present moment takes on an infinite value: it contains within it the entire
cosmos, and all the value and wealth of being.
It is quite remarkable that the two schools of Stoicism and Epicureanism,
in other respects so opposed, should both place the concentration of
consciousness upon the present moment at the very center of their way of life.
The difference between the two attitudes consists only in the fact that the
Epicurean enjoys the present moment, whereas the Stoic wills it intensely; for
the one, it is a pleasure; for the other, a duty.
Our scene from Faust echoes this double motif in two key phrases: "Only the
present is our happiness," and "Existence is a duty. " SR
In his conversations with Falk,.�1 Goethe had spoken of certain beings who, by
virtue of their innate tendencies, arc half Stoic and half Epicurean. He found
nothing surprising, he said, in the fact that they accepted the fundamental
principles of the two systems at the same time, and even that they tried to unite
them as far as was possible. One might say that Goethe himself, in his way of
living the present moment, was also "half Stoic and half Epicurean." He enjoyed
the present moment like an Epicurean, and willed it intensely like a Stoic.
In Goethe, we re-encounter most of the themes we have enumerated above;
in particular, the delimitation of the present followed by expansion into the
totality of the cosmos, which we observed in Epicureanism and in Stoicism .
In this regard, Goethe could have mentioned an opposition that was dear to
him: that between "systole" and "diastole. "
First of all, let u s consider concentration o n a n d delimitation of t h e present .
I n moments o f happiness, these processes take place spon taneously: "Then
the spirit looks neither forward nor behind . " This v e rse from Faust is ed10ed
by a poem ded icated to Cou n t Pua r : w

"Only the

Present

is

23 1

our Happiness "

Happiness looks neither forward nor backwards;
And thus the instant becomes eternal.
The present instant is perceived as a grace which is accorded us, or an
opportunity we are offered.
The mind may also, however, turn voluntarily away from the past and the
future, in order to more fully enjoy the present state of reality. Such is the
attitude of Goethe's Egmont:61
Do I live only in order to think about life? Must I prevent myself from
enjoying the present moment, that I may be sure of the one that follows,
and then waste that one, too, in cares and useless worries? . . . Does the
sun illuminate me today, that I may ponder what happened yesterday?
That I may guess at and arrange that which cannot be guessed nor
arranged: the fate of the oncoming day?
This is the same secret of happiness which Goethe formulated in the "Rule
of Life": 62
Would you model for yourself a pleasant life?
Worry not about the past
Let not anger get the upper hand
Rejoice in the present without ceasing
Hate no man . . . .
And the future? Abandon it to God.
This is the height of wisdom; the wisdom of the child in the
Elegy:63

Marienbad

Hour by hour, life is kindly offered us
We have learned but little from yesterday
Of tomorrow, all knowledge is forbidden,
And if I ever feared the coming evening,
The setting sun still saw what brought me joy.
Do like me, then: with joyful wisdom
Look the instant in the eye! Do not delay!
Hurry! Run to greet it, lively and benevolent,
Be it for action, for joy or for love!
Wherever you may be, be like a child, wholly and always;
Then you will be the All; and invincible.
·

The "rule of life" - that "high wisdom" - consists in looking neither
forwnrd 1101· hehind, but in becoming aware of the uniqueness and

Themes

232

incomparable value of the present. In Goethe, then, we find the same exercise
of delimitation of the present that we had encountered in ancient philosophy.
This

exercise

is,

however,

inseparable

from

another

exercise,

which

consists in becoming aware of the inner richness of the present, and of the
totality contained within the instant. By delimiting the present, consciousness,
far from shrinking, swells to fill the dimensions of the world ; for that
vision which "looks the instant in the eye" is the disinterested vision of
the artist, the poet, and the sage, which is interested in reality for its own
sake.
Enjoying the present, without thinking about the past or the future,
does not mean living in total instantaneousness. Thoughts about the past and
the future are to be avoided only
and

cowering

in

fear

of

future

insofar as rehashing past defeats,
difficulties,

can

cause

distractions,

worries, hopes, or despair, which turn our attention away from the present,
where it ought to be concentrated . When we do concentrate our attention on
the future, however, we discover that the present itself contains both the past
and the future, insofar as it is the genuine passage within which the action
and movement of reality are carried out. It is this past and this future which
are seized by the artist's vi sion, in the instant which he chooses to describe
or to reproduce. The artists of antiquity, says Goethe, knew how to
choose the "pregnant" instant, heavy with meaning, "which marks
a decisive turning-point between time and eternity." "' To use one of
Goethe's favorite terms, such instants "symbolize" an entire past, and an
entire future.
Likewise, when an artist seizes an instant of the movement of a dancer,
it

allows

us

to

glimpse

both

the

"before"

and

the

"after":

"The

marvelous suppleness with which a dancer moves from one figure to
another, and provokes our admiration in the face of such artistry: it is
fixated for a moment, so that wc can see, simultaneously, the past, the
present and the future, and wc are thus transported into a supra terrestrial
state." 6 5
Whoever practices the art of living must also recognize that each instant
is pregnant: heavy with meaning, it contains both the past and the future;
not only of the individual, but also of the cosmos in

which

he

is

plunged . This is what Goethe gives us to understand in his poem "The
Testament: " "'
Let reason b e present everywhere
Where life re j oices in life.
This point at which life rejoices in life iK nothing ot her thnn t he prcitcn t
i nstnnt. "Then," con t in ucN Goet he,

"Only the Present is

our

Happiness "

233

the past has gained steadfastness
The present is alive beforehand,
The Instant is eternity.
Goethe is even more explicit on this point in one of his conversations with
Eckermann:67 "Hold fast to the present. Every circumstance, every instant is
of infinite value, for it is the representative of an entire eternity. "
Some commentators have believed they could explain Goethe's conception
of the instant as eternity by Neoplatonic or Pietistic influence.68 It is true that
we do find within these traditions the representation of God as eternal
present; but such a conception is not to be found in Goethe's writings. When
Goethe speaks of the eternal in his poem entitled "Testament," for example,
he is talking about the eternity of the cosmic process of becoming:
Throughout all things, the Eternal pursues its course . . . .
Being is eternal, for laws
Protect the living treasures
With which the All adorns itself.
In order to explain the Goethean notion of the instant as representative of
eternity, we must rather think of the Epicurean and Stoic tradition of
which I have spoken above. This tradition affirmed, in the first place, that
one instant of happiness is equivalent to an eternity; and, secondly, that one
instant of existence contains the whole eternity of the cosmos. In Goethean
terms, this second idea could be expressed by saying that the instant is the
symbol of eternity. Goethe defined the symbol as "the living, instantaneous
revelation of the unexplorable," 69 but we could just as well define the
instant as "the living symbol of the unexplorable . " The idea of the
" u n ex plorabl e " corresponds to what, for Goethe, is the inexpressible mystery
at the basis of nature and of all reality . It is its very fleetingness and perishable
nature that make the instant the symbol of eternity, because its ephemeral
nature reveals the eternal movement and metamorphos i s which is, simulta­
neously, the eternal presence of being: "All that· is perishable is only a
symbol ." 70
It is here that the thought of death comes into play, for life itself is
perpet ual metamorp h osis , and, inseparably, the death of every instant.
Sometimes, for Goethe, th is theme takes on a mystical tone:
In order to find himself in the Infinite
The individual willingly accepts to disappear.
It is a pleasure to abandon oneself. 7 1
l would 1m1 i11&: the l iv i n g creat u re who

Themes

In the last analysis, then, it is eternity - that is, the totality of being - which
gives the present moment its value, meaning, and pregnancy. "If the eternal
remains present to us at each instant, we do not suffer from the fleetingness
of time." 73 The ultimate meaning of Goethe's attitude toward the present is
thus, as it was for ancient philosophy, the happiness and the duty of existing
in the cosmos. It is a profound feeling of participation in and identification
with a reality which transcends the limits of the individual . "Great is the joy
of existence, and greater yet the joy we feel in the presence of the world." 7�
"Throughout all things, the Eternal pursues its course. Hold on to Being with
delight!" 75
We ought here to cite the entire song of the watchman Lynceus near the
end of the Second Faust:
In all things, I see
The eternal adornment,
And since it pleases me,
I please myself as well.
You, my happy eyes: ·
Wh atever you have seen,
Be it what it may,
It certainly was beautiful.71•
In his work on Winckelmann, Goethe presents this wonderstruck consent
to being - to the being of the entire cosmos - as characteristic of the ancient
soul.
If man feels at home in the world as within an All, an All which is great,
beautiful, noble and precious; if the pleasure of living in harmony with
this All gives him a pure, free delight, then the universe - if it could be
conscious of itself - would exult with joy; it would have attained its goal,
and would be amazed at this summit of its becoming and its being. After
all, what good is all this profligate abundance of suns, planets, moons,
stars, Milky Ways, comets, nebula, worlds in the process of becoming
and which have come to be, if, when all is said and done, one happy
man does not rejoice, unconsciously, in his own existence?77
When Goethe says "unconsciously," he means that the reasons why people
may be happy, and may be in harmony with the universe, arc unknown and
completely incomprehensible to them. Here we come across another case of
the "unexplorable," 78 to use one of Goethe's favorite expressions. Y ct the
innocent joy of existing, and the spontaneous, unrcflccting pleasure wh ich
living beings take in existence, arc an origi n a l phenomenon which reveals the
presence of 1m uncxplorahlc m y11tcry : "The child iN plcni;cd b y l ht• cnkc,

"Only the Present is

our

Happiness "

235

without knowing anything about the pastry-cook; and starlings like cherries,
without them stopping to think about where they came from." 79
We again find this "yes" to the world and consent to being in the following
passage from Nietzsche, whatever reservations about it he himself may have had:
Let us assume we say "Yes!" to one single, unique moment: we have
thus said yes, not only to ourselves, but to the whole of existence. For
nothing is isolated, neither in ourselves nor in things. And if, even once,
our soul has vibrated and resounded like a string with happiness, all
eternity was necessary to create the conditions for this one event; and
all eternity has been approved, redeemed, justified, and affirmed.80
Not long ago, Georges Friedmann courageously denounced the tragic lack of
balance which has come about in the modern world between "power" and
"wisdom." 81 If we have chosen here to present some aspects of one of the
fundamental themes of the European spiritual tradition, it was not in order
to satisfy some historical or literary curiosity, but to describe a spiritual
attitude: an attitude which, for ourselves and for modern man in general,
hypnotized a s we arc by language, images, in formation, and t h e myt h o f th e
future, seemed to us to provide one of the best means of access to this
wisdom, so misunderstood and yet so necessary. The call of Socrates speaks
to us more now than ever before: "Take care for yourself." 82 This call is
echoed by Nietzsche's remark: "Is it not the case that all human institutions"
- to which we might add: "as well as the whole of modern life'' - are intended
to prevent mankind from feeling their life, by means of the constant
dispersion of their thoughts?" 83

The View from Above

No one has better expressed our longing for a view from above and flight of
the soul than Goethe's Faust, as he went for his Easter promenade with
Wagner and glimpsed the evening sunset:1
0 why does no wing lift me from the ground
To strive after the sun for ever?
In an endless evening dusk, I'd see
The silent earth beneath my feet.
Each hill would be ablaze, each vale bestilled,
And silver brooks would flow in golden streams . . .

Before me day, behind the night
Heaven above and underneath the waves:
A lovely dream, until it disappears! . . .
Alas! To the Spirit's wings
No mortal wing can join so easily.
And yet, when high above us, lost in vast blue spaces
The skylark sings her warbling tune,
It is inborn in every man,
That his mind surges onwards and upwards.
To the casual reader, this text seems to be nothing more than a dream about
flying: the banal desire, innate in every human being, to be able to fly. A mere
topos, in other words, as historians are often only too quick to categorize it.
In fact, however, the theme of the flight of the soul plays a role of
extraordinary importance in Goethe, as we can already glimpse from the
following lines of his letter to Schiller of May 1 2, 1 798: "Your letter found
me
in th e Iliad, to which I a l wa y s return with deligh t . It is a lways as if

had succeeded in freeing himself from the weight of the earth only a few years
previously. The Montgolfier brothers had carried out their first flight on
November 2 1 , 1 783. Goethe had been deeply impressed by this event, and in
an entirely unexpected way, this experience helped him to understand
Homeric poetry.
Besides the events they narrate, the Homeric epics show us the whole world
from the point of view of the gods, who look down upon mankind's battles
and passions from the heights of the heavens or the mountain tops, without,
however, being able to resist the temptation of intervening from time to time
on behalf of one or the other contending parties. For example, in the fifth
book of the Iliad, we speed through the space between heaven and earth
together with the steeds of Hera:
The horses winged their way unreluctant
through the space between the earth and the starry heaven.
As far as into the hazing distance a man can see with
his eyes, who sits in his eyrie gazing on the wine-blue water,
as far as this is the stride of the gods' proud neighing horses.3
At the beginning of book 1 3 , we adopt the point of view of Zeus, and observe
along with him the lands of the Thracians, the Mysians, and other such
peoples, while elsewhere, sitting with Poseidon high on the loftiest peak of
the green-wooded island of Samothrace, we gaze at the battle and the clamor
of arms before the walls of Troy.
For Goethe, the reason Homeric poetry can raise us above all earthly things,
and allow us to observe them from the point of view of the gods, is because
it represents the paradigm of true poetry. As Goethe puts it in Poetry and
Truth:
True poetry can be recognized by the fact that, like a secular Gospel,
through the inner cheerfulness and outward pleasure it procures us, it
can free us from the mundane burdens which weigh upon us. Like a
hot-air balloon, it lifts us up into higher regions, along with the ballast
that clings to us, and lets us see, from a bird's-eye view, the mad
labyrinths of the world spread out before us. 4
In the last sentence, Goethe has in mind not only the view from above of the
Homeric gods, but also the wings which Daedalus fashioned, in order to free
himself from the Labyrinth in which Minos had imprisoned him. We shall
later see in more detail why it is that, in Goethe's view, poetry has such an
astonishing power.

240

Themes

existential meaning attributed to them, first by ancient philosophy, and then
by Goethe, it may be useful to attempt to classify the various forms in which
they appear. Since our discussion will be concerned only with philosophical
and literary texts, we can leave aside the question of the real or ostensible
Shamanic origin of these themes. s
First of all, we should emphasize that ancient philosophy and literature do
not seem to have linked the theme of the flight of the soul with the ability to
fly; that is, with the mere sensory experience of flight. Rather, it went hand
in hand with a specific conception of the power of thought and the divine
nature of the soul, which is able to raise itself above the categories of space
and time. We cannot consider this power as a natural capacity of the human
soul qua inhabitant of the terrestrial regions, nor it is a supernatural
phenomenon. With regard to the first point, it is only natural that thought or
the thinking soul can transport itself rapidly, even instantaneously, to
wherever the object of thought happens to be. Already in the seventh book of
the Odyssey,6 the swiftness of ships is compared with that of wings and of
thought, while Xenophon, in his MemfJrabilia, remarks that the thought of the
soul, just like the divine thought, can instantarieously transport itself to Egypt
or to Sicily.7 This idea was frequently taken up by Philo of Alexandria, who
used it to illustrate the themes of the immortality of the soul, the greatness
of man, and his likeness to God."
According to another conception, however, the flight of the soul did not
consist in the mere experience of thinking, which is in a sense a banal,
everyday phenomenon. Rather, it was something that could only be experi­
enced under extraordinary circumstances: in particular, it came about as a
consequence of the separation of the soul from the body.
Here we recognize the doctrine of Plato: according to the myth of the
Phaedrus,9 the soul is provided with wings by nature. Prior to its incarnation
in a terrestrial body, the soul is thus able to rise up to the outermost limits
of the heavens, and follow the procession of the winged chariots of the gods.
If, however, the soul proves itself to be too weak for celestial existence, it loses
its wings and falls into a body. The soul can only win back its wings when it
separates itself from the body; in other words, after death. When Cicero in
the Tuscula11 Disputations,111 or Seneca in his Consolation to Marcia,1 1 speak of
the soul's post-mortem existence, they describe how souls discover the secrets
of nature and look down on the earth from above. Plato, however, would
above all have underlined the fact that, during its celestial journeys, the soul
can contemplate the supracelestial world of eternal forms, as it did in its
previous life, before its fall into the corporeal world.
Shortly before death, the soul already begins to feel the effects of its
imminent separation from the body; hence it is able to journey into t he
beyond. In the tenth book of the Rep11Mit', P l a to tells 1 he !ltory of Er t he

temporarily separated from his body. When Proclus discusses this passage in
his Commentary on Plato s Republic, 12 he reports a number of similar stories,
about Aristeas of Proconnesus, Hermodorus of Clazomenae, and Epimenides
of Crete. Democritus also seems to have made a collection of such stories, 13 and
Clearchus of Soloi, a pupil of Aristotle, told the tale of the psychic flight of a
certain Oeonymus of Athens, whose soul had risen high up above the earth,
and from there had had glimpses of completely unknown regions of the earth. 14
Plutarch, in his essay On the Delays of Divine Vengeance, recounts the
experiences of a certain Thespesius of Soloi, who had also been left for dead:
He saw nothing like what he had seen before: the stars were enormously
large, and immeasurably far from one another, and they shone forth
with a light of great force and marvelous colours, so that the soul, gently
and lightly transported by this light like a ship on a calm sea, could
quickly move to wherever it wished. 15
In the view of the ancients, even the most insignificant dream was a separation
of soul from body, in the course of which the soul could rise up to celestial
heights. We need only think of the example of Cicero's Dream of Scipio.16
The separation of soul from body can also occur by purely spiritual means.
This spiritual "death to the body" was carried out by means of philosophy,
for according to Plato, philosophy is nothing but training for death:
Shall we not say that purification occurs . . . when man separates the
soul as much as possible from the body, and accustoms it to gather itself
together from every part of the body and concentrate itself until it is
completely independent, and to have its dwelling, so far as it can, both
now and in the future, alone and by itself, freed from the shackles of
the body?17
We shall have occasion later on to return to the precise meaning of this
philosophical exercise. For the moment, suffice it to say that when Plato
wants to describe the philosophical life, he does so by means of the image of
the soul's gathering itself together, and its subsequent flight into the infinity
of the heavens. This flight allows the soul to look down from above at human
affairs, in the truest sense of the phrase.
As for the philosopher himself, Plato describes him as follows in the
Theaetetlls:
In fact, it is only his body that lives and has its residence in the state;
his soul, however, holds all this to be puny and meaningless, and
con 1 cmp1 uously wanders all over the place, "under the earth," as Pindar
N11 y 11 , 11 ml mt•u11urinic whatever is on its surface, and "above the heavens,"

242

Themes

observing the stars, and in general thoroughly investigating the nature
of everything that is, but without lowering itself to the level of any of
the objects in its vicinity . 1 a
In the Republic, Plato expresses the view that greatness of soul consists in
precisely such an attitude: "For smallness is particularly contrary to the soul
which always strives after the complete and perfect, both divine and
human." 19 Such a soul, capable of observing the totality of space and time,
has no fear even of death.
Here it might not be inappropriate to try to formulate more precisely two
concepts with which we have been dealing: on the one hand, the concept of
philosophy as a means of achieving spiritual death, and, on the other, the idea
of philosophy as the ascent of the soul into the celestial heights. Plato
developed these ideas and concepts in a specifically Platonic direction, but in
and of themselves they arc not specifically Platonic. Rather, they are to be
found in all the ancient philosophical schools, be they Epicurean, Stoic, or
Cynic.
In other words, in all schools - with the exception of Skepticism philosophy was held to be an exercise consisting in learning to regard both
society and the individuals who comprise it from the point of view of
universality. This was accomplished partly with the help of a philosophical
theory of nature, but above all through moral and existential exercises. The
goal of such exercises was to help people free themselves from the desires and
passions which troubled and harassed them. These needs and desires, it was
thought, were imposed on the individual by social conventions and the needs
of the body. The goal of philosophy was to eliminate them, so that the
individual might come to see things as nature herself sees them, and
consequently desire nothing other than that which is natural. If we leave aside
for the moment terminological and conceptual differences, we can say that,
within each school, philosophy signified the attempt to raise up mankind from
individuality and particularity to universality and objectivity. For example,
philosophical death for the Platonists consisted in getting rid of one's
passions, in order to attain to the autonomy of thought. For the Stoics,
philosophical death consisted in putting oneself in accord with universal
reason, the all-embracing Logos, both interior and exterior.
Thus, in each philosophical school we encounter one and the same
conception of philosophy. Similarly, in each philosophical school we find the
same conception of the the cosmic flight and the view from above as the
philosophical way par excellence of looking at things. In particular, P l atoni s ts ,
Stoics, and Epicureans all discovered, in addition to their theoretical phy si cs ,
a practical physics, which was conceived of as an exercise in which t h e

was to attain to greatness of soul, and in all schools its function was to teach
people to despise human affairs and to achieve inner peace.
The exercise of practical physics is already hinted at in Plato's

Timaeus,20

where the soul is urged to bring its inner movements into accord with the
movements and harmony of the all. Again, we find the same theme in the area
of meteorologia: that is, speech which - according to the Hippocratic method,
as Plato says in the

Phaedrus21

-

places the soul and human affairs within the

perspective of the all. Such a method, Plato adds, leads to nobility of thought.
Epicurean physics also opens up a wide field for mental flight, in the
infinity of space and the infinite n umber of worlds. Thus Lucretius: "Since
space stretches far beyond the boundaries of our world, into the infinite, our
mind seeks to sound out what lies within this infinity, in which the mind can
plunge its gaze at will, and to which the mind's thoughts can soar in free
flight. " 22 Elsewhere, Lucretius says that Epicurus has "boldly broken down
the tightly shut gates of nature," and "Advanced far beyond the the flaming
walls of our world. " 23 In mind and thought, claims Lucretius, Epicurus has
sped through the whole of infinity, thence to return victoriously and teach us
what can and cannot come into being. 24
This spiritual conquest of space kindled the enthusiasm of the eighteenth
century, which dreamed of producing a new Lucretius. Andre Chenier25
sought to give new life to this ideal in his unfinished poem "Hermes":
Equipped with the wings of Buffon
And lit by the torch of Newton, my flight
Often soars, with Lucretius, beyond the azure girdle
That stretches around the globe.
I sec Being, Life, and their unknown Source;
And all the worlds tumbling through the Ether.
I follow the comet with its fiery tail
And the stars, with their weight, form and distance;
I voyage with them in their immense orbits . . .
Before my avid gaze, the d iverse Elements unfold,
With their Strife and their Love, the Causes and the Infinite.26
To return to Epicurean cosmic flights: the Epicurean sage's gaze upon
in finity probably corresponds to that of the Epicurean gods. Unconcerned by
mundane affairs in their bright, eternal tranquillity, they spend their time
contemplating the infinity of space, time, and the multiple worlds.
We encounter this same tranquillity in the Stoic tradition, especially in the
text from Philo of Alexandria cited more fully below, which describes
philosophers in the following terms:

As their gonl is

a life of peace and serenity, they contemplate nature and

eve1·y 1 h in� found within her: they atten tively explore the earth, the sea,

244

Themes

the air, the sky, and every nature found therein. In thought, they
accompany the moon, the sun, and the rotations of the other stars,
whether fixed or wandering. Their bodies remain on earth, but they give
wings to their souls, so that, rising into the ether, they may observe the
powers which dwell there, as is fitting for those who have truly become
citizens of the world. 27
For Marcus Aurelius, only the "physical" viewpoint on things is capable of
giving us greatness of soul; thus we have often found him practicing those
spiritual exercises which have to do with the "physical" viewpoint on things.
As he says in book 9 of the Meditations: "You have the power to strip off
many superfluous things that are obstacles to yo u and that depend entirely
,

upon your value-j udgments; you will open up for yourself a vast space by
embracing the whole universe in your thoughts, by considering unending
eternity. " 28 In book 7, he admonishes himself as follows:
Watch and see the courses of the stars as if you were running alongside
them, and continually d well in your mind upon the changes of the
elements into one another; for these imaginations wash away the foulness
of life on the earth. When you are reasoning about mankind, look upon
earthly things below as if from some vantage point above them .29
We shall return later to the final phrase. Elsewhere, Marcus describes the way
in which the soul plunges itself into the totality of space and the infinity of
time: "it traverses the whole Universe and the surrounding void, and surveys
its shape, reaches out into the boundless extent of time, embracing and
pondering the periodic rebirth of the all . " 30 The goal of physics as a spiritual
exercise was to relocate human existence within the infinity of time and space,
and the perspective of the great laws of nature. This is what Marcus means
by the all-embracing m etamorphos i s he mentions,31 but he also has in mind
the correspondence of all things, and the mutual implication of each thing in
everything else.
Here, I believe, we have the reason why Goethe, in the passage quoted
above, considered true poetry as an exercise consisting in spiritually elevating
oneself high above the earth . For Goethe, poetry in the truest sense is a kind
of physics, in the sense we have defined above: it is a spiritual exercise, which
consists in looking down at things from above, from the point of view of the

nature or the all, and the great laws of nature. By "laws of nature" we are to
understand not only the all-embracing metamorphosis and unity of all things,
but also the two universal principles Goethe refers to as "polarity" and
"increase," and which he loved to observe bo1 h in nature and i n i n d i v i d ual
h uman life.32 We can detect the inspiration of 1 heHe idens not only i n Goet he's

The View from Above

unassuming poems of the older Goethe. Like the physics of antiquity, poetry
thus conceived is intended to bring about in its readers or listeners greatness
of soul and inner peace.
We now move on to another aspect of this spiritual exercise. The view
from above can also be directed pitilessly upon mankind's weaknesses and
shortcomings. All the philosophical schools dealt with this theme at length,
but, as we shall see, it was treated with particular relish by the Cynic
tradition. In Ovid's Metamorphoses, we find a Nee-Pythagorean version of the
theme: "It is a delight to travel along the starry firmament and, leaving the
earth and its dull regions behind, to ride on the clouds, to stand upon stout
Atlas' shoulders and see, far below, men wandering aimlessly, devoid of
reason, anxious and in fear of the hereafter, thus to exhort them and unroll
the book of fate!" 33 We encounter an Epicurean version of it at the beginning
of book 2 of Lucretius' On the Nawre of Things: "nothing is more delightful
than to possess wel l-fortified sanctuaries serene, built up by the teachings of
the wise, whence you may look down from on high upon others and behold
them all astray, wandering abroad and seeking the paths of life . " 34
The theme takes on a Stoic coloration in Seneca's Natural QJlestions.35 Here
the soul of the philosopher, looking down from the heights of the heavens,
becomes aware of the puniness of the earth, and the ridiculousness of the wars
fought by human armies - which resemble swarms of ants - over minuscule
stretches of terri tory. In Marcus Aurelius, the theme appears in a particularly
realistic form : "look upon earthly things below as if from some place above
them - herds, armies, farms, weddings, divorces, births, deaths, the noise of
law courts, lonely places, various foreign nations, festivals, mournings, market
places: a mixture of everything and an order composed of contraries . " 36
Elsewhere, Marcus enjoins us to: " 'Look from above' at the spectacle of
myriad herds, myriad rites, and manifold journeyings in storm and calm;
diversities of creatures who are being born, coming together, passing awa y . " 37
The view from above thus leads us to consider the whole of human reality,
in all its social, geographical, and emotional aspects, as an anonymous,
swarming mass, and it teaches us to relocate human existence within the
immeasurable dimensions of the cosmos. Everything that does not depend on

us, which the Stoics called indifferent (indiflerentia) - s u c h

as

health, fame,

wealth, and even death - is reduced to its true dimensions when considered
from the point of view of the nature of the all.
When the v iew from above takes on this sp ecific form of observing human
beings on earth, it seems more than ever to belong to the Cynic tradition . We
find it being used with particular effectiveness by Lucian , a contemporary of
Marcus Aurelius who was strongly influenced by Cynic doctrines. In Lucian's
dialogue entitled lcaromenippus, or the Sky-man, the Cynic Menippus confides
to a friend

thnt he wa s so d isillusioned by the contradictory teachings of the

philusuplll'n• l"onct•rning tht• ulti mate principles and the universe that he

246

Themes

resolved to fly up heaven to see for himself how things were.38 He fitted himself
out with a pair of wings - on the left side a vulture's wing and on the right
side that of an eagle - and soared upwards towards the moon. Once there, he
reported, "I rested myself, looking down on the earth from on high and like
Homer's Zeus, now observing the land of the horse-loving Thracians, now
the land of the Mysians, and presently, if I liked, Greece, Persia and India;
and from all this I got my fill of kaleidoscopic pleasure." 39 Once his eyes had
become accustomed to the tiny dimensions of human beings, however,
Menippus began to observe mankind. He could see "not only the nations and
cities but the people themselves as clear as could be, the traders, the soldiers,
the farmers, the litigants, the women, the animals, and, in a word, all the life
that the good green earth supports." "° Not only could Menippus see what
people were doing in the open air, but also what they were about inside their
own homes, when they thought no one was observing them. 41
After Menippus has recited a long list of the crimes and adulteries he had
seen committed inside people's homes, he sums up his overall impression:
what he saw was a cacophonous, ridiculous hodge-podge of a play. What he
found most ridiculous of all were those people who fought over the borders
of their cities and private land-holdings, since the earth itself appeared to him
so absurdly tiny and insignificant. Rich people, says Menippus, are proud of
completely unimportant things. Their domains arc no bigger than one of
Epicurus' atoms, and the sight of man's cities reminded him of an anthill,
with all its inhabitants scurrying about aimlessly.
Once he leaves the moon, Menippus travels among the stars until he arrives
at the dwelling-place of Zeus. There, he has a good laugh over the
ridiculously contradictory nature of the prayers mankind address to Zeus.
In another of Lucian's dialogues, entitled Charo11, or the lnspeclors,42
Charon, ferryman of the dead, asks for a day off, so that he can go up to the
surface of the earth and sec just what this earthly existence is which people
miss so much once they arrive in the underworld. With the help of Hermes,
he piles up several mountains on top of one another, so as to be able to
observe mankind better from on high. There follows the same kind of
description we have already seen in Marcus Aurelius and in the lcaromenippus:
Charon sees sea-travellers, trials, farmers - in a word, every kind of human
activity, but all with one thing in common: an existence full of pain. Charon
remarks: "If only humans could get it straight from the beginning: that
they're going to die; that, after a brief stay in life, they have to depart from
this life like a dream and leave everything on earth behind, then they'd live
more wisely and die with fewer regrets. " But man is thoughtless; he resembles
the bubbles thrown up by a waterfall, which burst as soon as they come into
existence.
As we have said, this kind of view from above, directed tow11rd m a n k i n d' !!
earthly existence, is a t y p ic a l man i fCi1t11 1 ion 111' Cyn icism . We can Nee t h i 11 by

247

The View from Above

the fact that the dialogue Charon bears the Greek subtitle Episleopountes, "The
Observers," or rather "The Overseers." The Cynic philosopher saw it as his
duty to supervise the actions of his fellow men, like a kind of spy, lying in
wait for their mistakes, so as to denounce them.43 The Cynic had the task of
watching over his fellow men like their censor, surveying their behavior from
the heights of a watchtower. The words episleopos or leatasleopos "overseer"
or "spy" - were used in antiquity as nicknames for the Cynics."" For them,
the view from above was intended to denounce the absurdity of human life.
It is no accident if, in one of Lucian's dialogues, it is precisely Charon,
ferryman of the dead, who plays the role of observing human affairs from
above; he is, after all, peculiarly well placed to observe them from the
perspective of death.
To observe human affairs from above means, at the same time, to see them
from the point of view of death. It is only this perspective which brings about
the necessary elevation and loosening of the spirit, which can provide the
distance we need in order to see things as they really are. The Cynic never
ceases denouncing mankind's delusions: forgetful of death, people passionate­
ly attach their hearts to some object - luxury or power, for example - which,
in the course of time, they will inevitably be forced to give up. This is why
the Cynics called upon mankind to rid themselves of superfluous desires, and
to reject social conventions, and the whole of artificial civilization, as being
nothing but a source of worries, care, and suffering. The Cynics would have
us return to a simple, purely natural way of life.
To return to Lucian: we learn from his short essay How One Should Write
History that the view from above is appropriate not only to the philosopher
but also to the historian. More precisely, the historian's gaze must be the same
as the philosopher's: courageous, free of party affiliations, not bound to any
nation, but equally well disposed towards all, making no concessions either to
friendship or to hate. This attitude must be expressed in the historian's
presentation of his materials. The historian, says Lucian, must be like
Homer's Zeus: gazing now at the land of the Thracians, now at the land of
the Mysians.45
For the third time now, we encounter the Homeric topos of a god casting
his gaze down at the earth. This time, however, the Homeric source is quoted
so as to serve as a model of that impartiality which must characterize historical
reporting, thanks to the elevated viewpoint the historian has elected as his
own. This is what a modern writer might refer to as "the viewpoint of Sirius."
Thus we find Ernest Renan writing in 1 880: "Viewed from the solar system,
our revolutions have scarcely the extent of the movements of atoms.
Considered from Sirius, they are even smaller still. " �6 To adopt the viewpoint
of Sirius means, here again, to undertake the spiritual exercise of letting go
a n d usin!( reserve, so as to achieve impartiality, objectivity, and critical

I have only been able to bring up here a few aspects of an extraordinarily
rich tradition. If - as I hope to do one day - one were to write the complete
history of the theme of the view from above, many other texts would have to
be taken into consideration. Here, by way of conclusion, I shall restrict myself
to citing Baudelaire's poem "E levation," in which the great Symbolist describes
the experience of the poet. For him, the poet was a being not meant for this
world (as he put it in "The Albatross," "His huge wings prevent him from
walking"). Yet, thanks to his poetic gifts, which allow him to observe things
from above, the poet is also a being capable of seizing the hidden correspond­
ences in things. We thus return to the theme of Goethe's "true poetry," which
is really a kind of physics in the sense in which we have defmed this term
above: an intensive attempt to plunge into the secrets of nature.

[Elevation]
Above the ponds, above the valleys,
The mountains, woods, the clouds, and seas,
Beyond the sun, beyond the ether-,
Beyond the limits of the starry spheres,
My spirit, you move with swift agility.
Like a good swimmer at home in the sea,
You slice gay furrows through the measureless depths,
With ineffable, masculine joy.
Fly far away from these pestilent fumes,
Go cleanse yourself in the upper air.
Go drink, like a pure, celestial liquor,
The bright fire that fills transparent space.
Left behind, all cares and endless sorrow
That weigh upon our foggy life like stones!
Oh happy man, who soars on sturdy wings
To calm and luminous fields!
In the morning, his thoughts, in their freedom,
soar up to the heavens like larks.
- He sails over life, u nderstanding with ease
The language of flowers and voiceless things. •7

The Sage and the World

1

Definition of the Problem

No one has described the relationship between the ancient sage and the world
around him better than Bernard Groethuysen:
The sage's consciousness of the world is something peculiar to
him alone. Only the sage never ceases to have the whole constantly
present to his mind. He never forgets the world, but thinks and
acts with a view to the cosmos. . . . The sage is a part of the world;
he is cosmic. He does not let himself be distracted from the world,
or detached from the cosmic totality . . . . The figure of the sage
forms, as it were, an indissoluble unity with man's representation of the
world.1
This is particularly true of the Stoic sage, whose fundamental attitude
consisted in a joyful "Yes!" accorded at each instant to the movement of the
world, directed as it is by universal reason. We recall Marcus Aurelius'
well-known prayer to the universe: "All that is in tune with you, 0 universe,
is in tune with me." 2 Perhaps less well known is the aesthetic theory Marcus
developed from the same point of view:
If a person has experience and a deeper insight into the processes of
the universe, there will be hardly any phenomenon accompanying
these processes that does not appear to him, at lea'>t in some of
its aspects, as pleasant. And he will look upon the actual gaping jaws
of wild beasts with no less pleasure than upon all the imitations of
them that sculptors and painters offer us . . . . and there are many
such things, which do not appeal to everyone; only to
that person w ho has truly familiarized himself with nature and her
wurk i n tCI' · 1

252

Themes

We recall, moreover, that the Stoic sage, like Seneca, was conscious of being
a part of the world, and plunged himself into the totality of the cosmos: Ioli
se inserens mundo.4
The same could be said of the Epicurean sage, even though the physics he
professed considered the world to be the result of chance, excluding all divine
intervention. Nevertheless, this conception of the world suited the Epicurean
perfectly: it brought with it pure pleasure and peace of mind, freed him from
unreasonable fear of the gods, and made him consider each instant as a kind
of unexpected miracle. As Hoffmann pointed out,5 it is precisely because the
Epicurean considered existence to be the result of pure chance that he greeted
each moment with immense gratitude, like a kind of divine miracle. The
sage's pleasure came from contemplating the world in peace and serenity; and
in this he resembled the gods, who took no part in the management of the
world, lest their eternal repose be disturbed. Describing the sage's contempla­
tion, analogous to that of the gods, Lucretius exclaimed :
the terrors of the mind fly away, the walls of the world part asunder, I
see things moving on through all the void . : . At these things, as it were,
some godlike pleasure and a thrill of awe seizes on me, to think that thus
. . . nature is made so clear and manifest, laid bare to sight on every
side.6
This cosmic dimension is thus essential to the figure of the antique sage.
Here the reader may object: it could well be that ancient wisdom - whether
Platonic, Aristotelian, Stoic, or Epicurean - was intimately linked with a
relationship to the world; but isn't this ancient vision of the world out of date?
The quantitative universe of modern science is totally unrepresentable, and
within it the individual feels isolated and lost. Today, nature is nothing more
for us than man's "environment"; she has become a purely human problem,
a problem of industrial hygiene. The idea of universal reason no longer makes
much sense.
All this is quite true. But can the experience of modern man be reduced to
the purely technico-scientific? Does not modern man, too, have his own
experience of the world qua world? Finally, might not this experience be able
to open up for him a path toward wisdom?

The World of Science and the World of Everyday Perception

It would be stating the obvious to affirm that the world which we perceive in
our everyday experience is radically different from the unrepresentable world
constructed by the scientist. The world of science docs i n d ee d , by mennK of

daily life. Yet it is essential to realize that our way of perceiving the world in
everyday life is not radically affected by scientific concepti9ns. For all of us
- even for the astronomer, when he goes home at night - the sun rises and
sets, and the earth is immobile.
Following Husserl, Merleau-Ponty developed some noteworthy reflec­
tions on this opposition between the world of science and the world of
perception:
The entire world of science is constructed on the basis of the world as
we experience it [sur le monde vecu], and if we want rigorously to think
through science itself, in order precisely to appreciate its range and its
meaning, we must first of all reawaken this experience of the world, of
which science is the secondary expression.7
For lived, existential experience, the earth is nothing other than the immobile
ground8 in relation to which I move, the fundamental referent of my
existence. It is this earth, immobile in relation to our experienced movements,
that even the astronaut uses as a reference point, including when, from the
depths of space, the earth appears to him like a little blue ball. The analyses
of Husserl and Merleau-Ponty thus let us see that the Copernican revolution,
of which so much is made in philosophy handbooks, upset only the theoretical
discourse of the learned about the world, but did not at all change the
habitual, day-to-day perception we have of the world.
We must, however, be more specific about the opposition between the
world of science and the world of everyday perception . The reason why
Husserl and Merleau-Ponty want us to return to the world of lived
perception, or rather to this perception-as-a-world, is so that we may become
awa.re of it. This awareness, in tum, will radically transform our very
perception of the world, since it will no longer be a perception of distinct
objects, but perception of the world as a world, and, especially for Merleau­
Ponty, perception of the uni()' of the world and of perception. In their view,
philosophy is nothing other than this process by means of which we try "to
relearn to see the world." 9
In a sense, one might say that the world of science and the world of
philosophy are both, in their own way, opposed to the world of habitual
perception. In the case of science, this opposition takes the form of the
elimination of perception. Science discloses to us a universe reduced, by both
mathematical and technological means, to its quantitative aspects. Philosophy,
for its part, deepens and transforms h:\_b itual perception, forcing us to become
aware of the very fact the we are perceiving the world, and that the world is
that which we perceive.

Life requires that we put on blinkers; we must not look to the right, to
the left, or behind, but straight ahead, in the direction in which we
are supposed to walk. In order to live, we must be selective in
our knowledge and our memories, and retain only that which may
contribute to our action upon things.
Bergson continues: "We could say the same thing about perception. As an
auxi liary of action, it isolates, out of the totality of the real, that which
interests us. " Some people, however, are born detached: artists.
When they look at a thing, they see itfor itselJ, and no longer for lhem. They
no longer perceive merely for the sake of action: they perceive for the sake
of perceiving; that is, for no reason, for the pure pleasure of it . . .
That which nature does once in a long while, out of distraction, for a
few privileged people; might not philosophy . . . attempt the same thing,
in another sense and in another way, for everybody? Might not the role
of philosophy be to bring us to a more complete perception of reality,
by means of a kind of displacement of our attention?
The "displacement of attention" of which Bergson speaks, as in the case of
Merleau-Ponty's "phenomenological reduction," is in fact a conversion: 1 1 a
radical rupture with regard to the state of unconsciousness in which man
normally lives. The utilitarian perception we have of the world, in everyday
life, in fact hides from us the world qua world. Aesthetic and philosophical
perceptions of the world are only possible by means of a complete transfor­
mation of our relationship to the world: we have to perceive it for itself, and
no longer for ourselves.

3

Aesthetic Perception

Bergson and, as we shall see later, Merleau-Ponty consider the aesthetic
perception of the world as a kind of model for philosophical percep,tion. In
fact, as J. Ritter has pointed out,12 it is only with the flourishing of modem
science, from the eighteenth century on, and the transformation of the
philosopher's relationship to nature which came about as a result, that we find
an awareness of the necessity of an "aesthetic" mode of perception, in order
to allow existence - man's Dasein - to maintain the cosmic dimension essential
to human existence. As early as 1 750, Baumgarten,u in his Aeslhetica, had
opposed veritas /ogica to verilas aesthetica1•: veritas /ogica was, for exam p le, the
knowledge of an eclipse appropriate to a n astronomer, w h i l e aesthetic truth
might be, for ex am p l e , a s he p he rd ' s emotional perception of t he same

1 790, Kant also opposed aesthetic perception to scientific knowledge. In order
to perceive the ocean as sublime, writes Kant, it is not necessary to associate
with it all sorts of geographical or meteorological knowledge while we look at
it. Rather: "one must come to see the ocean, all by itself - just as the poets
do, exclusively a cco rding to what it displays to the eye, when it is contemplated
either at rest, in the form of a limpid mirror of water, or when it is violently
stirred, like an abyss threatening to swallow up everything." 15 When, between
1 8 1 5 and 1 830, C.G. Carus wrote his Lettres sur la peinture de paysage,16 he

characterized landscape-painting as the "art of the representation of the life
of the earth [Erdlebenbildkunst]." For Carus, it is thanks to aesthetic percep­
tion that we may continue to live in that perceptive, lived relationship with
the earth, which constitutes an essential dimension of human existence.
Thus, a disinterested, aesthetic perception of the world can allow us to
imagine what cosmic consciousness might signify for modern man. Modern
artists, reflecting on their art, regard it as inseparable from a completely
characteristic experience of the world.
In the first place, the modern artist consciously participates in cosmic life
as he creates. "The dialogue with nature," writes Paul Klee, 17 "remains for
the artist the condition sine qua non. The artist is a man. He is himself nature,
a part of nature within the domain of nature." This dialogue with nature
presupposes an intense communication with the world, carried out not merely
through visual channels: "Today, the artist is better and more subtle than a
camera . . . he is a creature upon earth and a creature within the universe; a
creature on one star among the other stars." This is why there are, according
to Klee, means other than visual for establishing the relationship between the
self and its object. There is the fact that we plunge our roots into the same
soil, and that we share a common participation in the cosmos. This means
that the artist must paint in a state in which he feels his unity with the earth
and with the universe.
For Klee, then, abstract art appears as a kind of prolongation of the work
of nature:
[The artist's] progress in the observation and vision of nature gradually
lets him accede to a philosophical vision of the universe which allows
him freely to create abstract forms . . . Thus, the artist creates works of
art, or participates in the creation of works, which are an image of the
creative work of God . . . Just as children imitate us while playing, so
we, in the game of art, imitate the forces which created, and continue
to create, the world . . . Na t ura naturans is more important to the painter
than ttaturti ttaturata. 1 8
We

rc-enl·ountcr this cosmic consciousness in Cezanne. 19 "Have you seen

thnt l(il{1m t k Tin torclto in Venice," he writes,

256

Themes

in which the earth and the sea, the terraqueous globe, are hanging
above people's heads? The horizon is moving off into the distance; the
depth, the ocean distances, and bodies are taking flight, an immense
rotundity, a mappamundi; the planet is hurled, falling and rolling in
mid-ether! . . . He was prophesying for us. He already had the same
cosmic obsession which is consuming us now . . . . As for me, I want to
lose myself in nature, to grow again with her, like her . . . . In a patch
of green, my whole brain will flow along with the flowing sap of the
trees . . . . The immensity, the torrent of the world, in a tiny thumb's
worth of matter.
As we saw, the painter, according to Klee, feels himself to be a
"piece of nature, within the domain of nature." We find the same theme
in Roger Caillois' Generalized Aesthetics,11.l apropos of the experience of
beauty:
Natural structures constitute both the initial and the final reference
point of all imaginable beauty, although beauty is human appreciation.
Since man himself belongs to nature, the circle can easily be closed, and
the feeling man has of beauty merely reflects his condition as a living
being and integral part of the universe. It does not follow from this that
nature is the model of art, but rather that art constitutes a particular
instance of nature: that which occurs when the aesthetic act undergoes
the additional process of design and execution.
The artistic process shares with the creative process of nature the charac­
teristic of rendering things visible, causing them to appear. Merleau-Ponty
laid great stress on this idea:21 "Art no longer imitates visible things; it makes
things visible. 22 It is the blueprint of the genesis of things. Paintings show how
things become things and how the world becomes a world . . . . how moun­
tains become, in our view, mountains." Painting makes us feel the presence
of things: the fact that "things arc here.'' "When CCzannc strives after depth,"
continues Mcrleau-Ponty, "what he's really seeking is the combustion of
being."
The experience of modern art thus allows us to glimpse - in a way that
is, in the last analysis, philosophical - the miracle of perception itself,
which opens up the world to us. Yet we can only perceive this miracle by
reflecting on perception, and converting our attention. In this way, we can
change our relationship to the world, and when we do so, we arc astonished
by it. We break off "our familiarity with the world, and this break can teach
us nothing other than the unmotivated surgi n g fo r t h of the world. " 2·1 At such
momen ts, it is as if we we re seeing the world nppcnr before our eyes for the
-

first t ime.

Spectator Novus

There is nothing new in what we have said so far. Our reason for recalling it
was in order to define the area of our experience in which there might be
possible a relationship to the world bearing some resemblance to that which
existed between the ancient sage and the cosmos: the world, that is, of
perception. We are now in a position to show that, since ancient times, there
have existed exercises by means of which philosophers have tried to transform
their perception of the world, in a way analogous to Merleau-Ponty's
phenomenological reduction, or to the conversion of attention spoken of by
Bergson. Obviously, the philosophical discourses by which Bergson, Merleau­
Ponty, and the philosophers of antiquity express or justify the procedure
which leads to the transformation of perception are very different from one
another, just as the discussions of Klee or CCzanne about painting are not to
be confused with the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty. Be that as it may,
Mcrleau-Ponty was deeply conscious of the sense in which, above and beyond
differences of discourse, the experiences of Klee or CCzanne coincided with
his own. One could say the same about the similar experience which can be
glimpsed behind certain quite striking texts from antiquity.
For example, let us consider this passa ge from one of Seneca's Leuers lo
Luci/ius: "As for me, I usually spend a great deal of time in the contemplation
of wisdom. I look at it with the same stupefaction with which, on other
occasions, I look at the world; this world that I quite often feel as though I
were seeing for the first time [ 1amquam spectatt1r novus ]. " 24 If Seneca speaks
of stupefaction, it is because he sometimes finds that he discovers the world
all of a sudden, "as though [he] were seeing it for the first time." At such
moments, he becomes conscious of the transformation taking place i n his
perception of the world. Normally, he had not been in the habit of seeing the
world, and consequently was not astonished by it. Now, all of a sudden, he
is stupefied, because he sees the world with new eyes.
The Epicurean Lucretius was familiar with the same experience as the Stoic
Seneca. In book 2 of his On the Ntiture of Things,- he announces that he is
goi ng to proclaim a new teaching: "A truth wondrously new is struggl i ng to
fall upon your ears, and a new face of things to reveal itself." Indeed, it is not
surprising if this new teaching strikes the imagination: Lucretius is about to
assert the existence of infinite space, and, within this infinite space, of a
plurality of worlds. In order to prepare his reader for this novelty, Lucretius
introduces some considerations about mankind's psychological reactions to
novelties. On the one hand, he says, we find that which is new difficult to
believe; whatever disturbs our mental habits seems to us a priori false and
inadmissible. Once we ha v e admitted it, however, the same force of habit
wh ich mudt• 1 hc novelty surprising and par ado x i c a l subseq uently makes it

258

seem banal, and our admiration gradually diminishes. Lucretius then de­
scribes how the world would look to us if we saw it for the first time:
First of all, the bright, clear colour of the sky, and all it holds within
it, the stars that wander here and there, and the moon and the
radiance of the sun with its brilliant light; all these, if now they had been
seen for the first time by mortals, if, unexpectedly, they were in a
moment placed before their eyes, what story could be told more
marvelous than these things, or what that the nations would less dare to
believe beforehand? Nothing, I believe; so worthy of wonder would this
sight have been. Yet think how no one now, wearied with satiety of
seeing, deigns to gaze up at the shining quarters of the sky!25
These texts are extremely important for our purpose. They show that,
already in antiquity, people were not conscious of living in the world. They
had no time to look at the world, and philosophers strongly sensed the
paradox and scandal of the human condition: man lives in the world without
perceiving the world. Bergson correctly grasped the reason for this situation,
when he distinguished between habitual, utilitarian perception, necessary for
life, and the detached, disinterested perception of the artist or philosopher.
What separates us from the world is thus not the irrepresentable character of
the scientific universe - the world we live in is, after all, that of lived
perception - and neither is it contemporary doubts about the rational
character of the world: Lucretius had already denied this rationality. People
in antiquity were unfamiliar with modern science, and did not live in an
industrial, technological society; yet the ancients didn't look at the world any
more than we usually do. Such is the human condition. In order to live,
mankind must "humanize" the world; in other words transform it, by action
as well as by his perception, into an ensemble of "things" useful for life.
Thus, we fabricate the objects of our worry, quarrels, social rituals, and
conventional values. That is what our world is like; we no longer see the world
qua world. In the words of Rilke, we no longer see "the Open"; we see only
the "future." Ideally, we would
see everything
and ourselves in everything
healed and whole
forever.26
The obstacle to perceiving the world is not to be found in modernity, but
within man himself. We must separate ourselves from the world qua world in
orde r to l i ve our daily l i fe, but we muHI 11cpnrate ourscl ve11 fro m the

The Instant

There is a well-known text, in which we can see both the echo of ancient
traditions and the anticipation of certain modern attitudes: Rousseau's
Reveries du promeneur solitaire.21 What is remarkable in this passage is that we
cannot help but recognize the intimate connection which exists, for Rousseau,
between cosmic ecstasy and the transformation of his inner attitude wit h
regard to time. On the one hand, "every individual object escapes him; he
sees and feels nothing which is not in the whole." 28 Yet, at the same time,
"Time no longer means anything [to him] . . . the present lasts forever,
without letting its duration be sensed, and without any trace of succession.
There is no sensation - either of privation or of enjoyment, pleasure or pain,
desire or fear - other than the one single sensation of our existence. " 29 Here
Rousseau analyzes, in a most remarkable way, the elements which constitute
and make possible a disinterested perception of the world. What is required
is concentration on the present moment, a concentration in which the spirit
is, in a sense, without past nor present, as it experiences the simple "sensation
of existence." Such concentration is not, however, a mere turning in
upon oneself. On the contrary: the sensation of existence is, inseparably,
the sensation of being in the whole and the sensation of the existence of the
whole.
In Rousseau, all this is a passive, almost mystical state. For the
ancients, however, it is quite apparent that the transformation of one's view
of the world was intimately linked to exercises which involved con­
centrating one's mind on the present instant.30 I n Stoicism as well as in
Epicureanism, such exercises consisted in "separating oneself from the
future and past," in order to "delimit th e present instant." 31 Such a tech­
nique gives the mind, freed from the burden and prejudices of the past, as
well as from worry about the future, tha t inner detachment, freedom, and
peace which are indispensable prerequisites for perceiving the world qua
world. We have here, moreover, a kind of reciprocal causality: the mind
acquires peace and serenity by becoming aware of its relationship with the
world, to the extent that it re-places our existence within the cosmic
perspective.
This concentration on the present moment lets us discover the in­
finite value and unheard-of miracle of our presence in the world. Concentra­
tion on the present instant implies the suspension of our projects for the
future. In other words, it implies that we must think of the present
moment as the last moment, and that we live each day and each hour as if
it were our last. For the Epicureans, th is exercise reveals the incredible
stroke of luck thnnks to which each moment we live in the world is made
po1111ihlc.

Believe that every day that dawns will be the final one for you. If you
do, you will receive each unexpected hour with gratitude.32
Receive each moment of accumulating time as though it came about by
an incredible stroke of luck. 33
Let the soul find its joy in the present, and learn to hate worries about
the future.34
Albeit for different reasons, the Stoics also shared this attitude of
wonder at what appears and occurs in the present instant. For them, each
instant and each present moment imply the entire universe, and the whole
history of the world. Just as each instant presupposes the immensity of
time, so does our body presuppose the whole universe. It is within ourselves
that we can experience the coming-into-being of reality and the presence of
being. By becoming conscious of one single instant of our lives, one single
beat of our hearts, we can feel ourselves linked to the entire immensity of the
cosmos, and to the wondrous fact of the world's existence. The whole
universe is present in each part of reality. For the Stoics, this experience of
the instant corresponds to their theory of the mutual interpenetration of the
parts of the universe. Such an experience, however, is not necessarily linked
to any theory. For example, we find it expressed in the following verses by
Blake:
To see a World in a Grain of Sand
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
And Eternity in an hour.35
To sec the world for the last time is the same thing as to see it for the first
time, tamqutim spectator 11ovus. 36 This impression can be caused by the thought
of death, which reveals to us the miraculous character of our relationship to
the world: always in peril, always unforeseeable. Alternatively, it can be
caused by the feeling of novelty brought about by concentrating one's
attention on one instant, one moment of the world: the world then seems to
come into being and be born before our eyes. We then perceive the world as
a "nature" in the etymological sense of the world: physis, that movement of
growth and birth by which things manifest thcmselves.37 We experience
ourselves as a moment or instant of this movement; this immense even t which
reaches beyond us, is always already there before us, and is always beyond us.
We are born along with 38 the world. Th e feeling of existence of wh ich
Rousseau spoke is preci s ely this fee l in g of ident i ty between univl�rsul bcinic
and our own ex istence .

The Sage and the World

Seneca was equally stupefied by the spectacle of the world (which he
contemplated

tamquam spectator novus) , and by the spectacle of wisdom . By

"wisdom,'' he meant the figure of the sage, as he saw i t personified in the
personality of the philosopher Sextus.
This

is a very instructive parallel . There is in fact a strict analogy between

the movement by which we accede to the vision of the world, and that by
which we postulate the figure of the sage. In the first place, ever since Plato's

Symposium, ancient philosophers considered the figure of the sage as an
inaccessible role model, whom the philo-sopher (he who loves wisdom) strives
to imitate, by means of an ever-renewed effort, practiced at each instant. 39 To
contemplate wisdom as personified within a specific personality was thus to
carry out a movement of the spirit in which, via the life of this personality,
one was led toward the representation of absolute perfection, above and
beyond all of its possible realizations. Similarly, in considering a partial aspect
of the world , contemplation discovers the totality of the world , going beyond
the landscape�0 glimpsed at a given moment, and transcending it on the way
to a representation of totality which surpasses every visible object.
The contemplation mentioned by Seneca is, moreover, a kind of unitive
contemplation. In order to perceive the world, we must, as it were, perceive our

uni()! with the world, by means of an exercise of concentration on the present
moment. Similarly, in order to recognize wisdom, we must, so to speak, go
into training for wisdom. We can know a thing only by becoming similar to
our object. Thus, by a total con version, we can render ourselves open to the
world and to wisdom. This is why Seneca was j ust as stupefied and filled with
ecstasy by the spectacle of wisdom as he was by the spectacle of the world. For
him, in both instances, it was a case of a discovery obtained by dint of an
interior transformation and complete change in his way of seeing and living.
In the final analysis, both the world as perceived in the conseiousness of the
sage, and the sage's consciousness itself, plunged in the totality of the world,
are revealed to the lover of wisdom in one single, unique movement.

Philosophy as a Way of Life

Every person - whether Greek or Barbarian - who is in training for
wisdom, leading a blameless, irreproachable life, chooses neither to
commit injustice nor return it unto others, but to avoid the company of
busybodies, and hold in contempt the places where they spend their
time - courts, councils, marketplaces, assemblies - in short, every kind
of meeting or reunion of thoughtless people. As their goal is a life of
peace and serenity, they contemplate nature and everything found
within her: they attentively explore the earth, the sea, the air, the sky,
and every nature found therein. In thought, they accompany the moon,
the sun, and the rotations of the other stars, whether fixed or wandering.
Their bodies remain on earth, but they give wings to their souls, so that,
rising into the ether, they may observe the powers which dwell there, as
is fitting for those who have truly become citizens of the world. Such
people consider the whole world as their city, and its citizens are the
companions of wisdom; they have received their civic rights from virtue,
which has been entrusted with presiding over the universal common­
wealth. Thus, filled with every excellence, they are accustomed no
longer to take account of physical discomforts or exterior evils, and they
train themselves to be indifferent to indifferent things; they are armed
against both pleasures and desires, and, in short, they always strive to
keep themselves above passions . . . they do not give in under the blows
of fate, because they have calculated its attacks in advance (for foresight
makes easier to bear even the most difficult of the things that happen
against our will; since then the mind no longer supposes what happens
to be strange and novel, but its perception of them is dulled, as if it had
to do with old and worn-out things). It is obvious that people such as
these, who find their joy in virtue, celebrate a festival their whole l i fe
long. To be sure, there is o n l y a s m a l l n u mber of s u c h people; t h e y arc

people everywhere felt the same way as this small number, and became
as nature meant for them to be: blameless, irreproachable, and lovers of
wisdom, rejoicing in the beautiful just because it is beautiful, and
considering that there is no other good besides it . . . then our cities
would be brimful of happiness. They would know nothing of the things
that cause grief and fear, but would be so filled with the causes of joy
and well-being that there would be no single moment in which they
would not lead a life full of joyful laughter; indeed, the whole cycle of
the year would be a festival for them.1
In this passage from Philo of Alexandria, inspired by Stoicism, one of the
fundamental aspects of philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman eras comes
clearly to the forefront. During this period, philosophy was a way of life. This
is not only to say that it was a specific type of moral conduct; we can easily
see the role played in the passage from Philo by the contemplation of nature.
Rather, it means that philosophy was a mode of existing-in-the-world, which
had to be practiced at each instant, and the goal of which was to transform
the whole of the individual's life.
For the ancients, the mere word philo-sophia the love of wisdom - was
enough to express this conception of philosophy. In the Symposium, Plato had
shown that Socrates, symbol of the philosopher, could be identified with Eros,
the son of Poros (expedient) and of Penia (poverty). Eros lacked wisdom, but
he did know how to acquire it. 2 Philosophy thus took on the form of an
exercise of the thought, will, and the totality of one's being, the goal of which
was to achieve a state practically inaccessible to mankind: wisdom. Philosophy
was a method of spiritual progress which demanded a radical conversion and
transformation of the individual's way of being.
Thus, philosophy was a way of life, both in its exercise and effort to
achieve wisdom, and in its goal, wisdom itself. For real wisdom docs not
merely cause us to know: it makes us "be" in a different way. Both the
grandeur and the paradox of ancient philosophy are that it was, at one and
the same time, conscious of the fact that wisdom is inaccessible, and
convinced of the necessity of pursuing spiritual progress. In the words of
Qµintillian : "We must . . . strive after that which is highest, as many of the
ancient<> did. Even though they believed that no sage had ever yet been found,
they nevertheless continued to teach the precepts of wisdom . " ·1 The ancients
knew that they would never be able to realize wisdom within themselves as a
stable, definitive state, but they at least hoped to accede to it in certain
privileged moments, and wisdom was the transcendent norm which guided
their action.
Wisdom, then, was a way of life which brought peace of mind (alaraxia),
inner freedom (11u1arkeia), and a cosmic consciousness. First and foremost,

anguish . This concept is stated explicitly in Xenocrates; and in Epicurus: 5
"We must not suppose that any other object i s t o b e gained from the
knowledge of the phenomena of the sky . . . than peace of mind and a sure
confidence." This was also a prominent idea for the Stoics6 and for the
Skeptics, apropos of whom Sextus Empiricus7 utilizes the following splendid
image:
Apelles, the famous painter, wished to reproduce the foam from a
horse's mouth in a painting. He was not able to get it right, and decided
to give up. So, he threw the sponge he used to wipe his brushes against
the painting. When the sponge hit the painting, it produced nothing
other than an imitation of a horse's foam. In the same way, the Skeptics
start off like the other philosophers, seeking peace of mind in firmness
and confidence in their j udgments. When they do not achieve it, they
suspend their judgment. No sooner do they they do this than, by pure
chance, peace of mind accompanies the suspension of judgment, like a
shadow follows a body.
Philosophy presented itself as a method for achieving independence and
inner freedom (autarkeia), that state in which the ego depends only upon
itself. We encounter this theme in Socrates,8 among the Cynics, in Aristotle
- for whom only the contemplative life is independent9 - in Epicurus, 10 and
among the Stoics. 1 1 Although their methodologies differ, we find in all
philosophical schools the same awareness of the power of the human self to
free itself from everything which is alien to it, even if, as in the case of the
Skeptics, it does so via the mere refusal to make any decision .
In Epicureanism and in S toicism, cosmic consciousness was added to these
fundamental dispositions. By "cosmic consciousness," we mean the con­
sciousness that we are a part of the cosmos, and the consequent dilation of
our self throughout the infinity of universal nature. In the words of Epicurus'
disciple Metrodorus: "Remember that, although you are mortal and have only
a limited life-span , yet you have risen , through the contemplation of nature,
to the infinity of space and time, and you have seen all the past and all the
future. " 1 2 According to Marcus Aurelius: "The rational soul . . . travels
through the whole universe and the void that surrounds it . . . it reaches out
into the boundless extent of infinity, and it examines and contemplates the
periodic rebirth of all things. " 13 At each instant, the ancient sage was
conscious of living in the cosmos, and he placed himself in harmony with

the

cosmos.

fact, parts of philosophy itself, but rather parts of philosophical discourse. By
this they meant that when it comes to teaching philosophy, it is necessary to
set forth a theory of logic, a theory of physics, and a theory of ethics. The
exigencies of discourse, both logical and pedagogical, require that these
distinctions be made. But philosophy itself - that is, the philosophical way of
life - is no longer a theory divided into parts, but a unitary act, which consists
in living logic, physics, and ethics. In this case, we no longer study logical
theory - that is, the theory of speaking and thinking well - we simply think
and speak well. We no longer engage in theory about the physical world, but
we contemplate the cosmos. We no longer theorize about moral action, but
we act in a correct and just way.
Discourse aboul philosophy is not the same thing as philosophy. Polemon, one
of the heads of the Old Academy, used to say:
we should exercise ourselves with realities, not with dialectical specula­
tions, like a man who has devoured some textbook on harmonics, but
has never put his knowledge into practice. Likewise, we must not be like
those who can astonish their onlookers by their skill in syllogistic
argumentation, but who, when it comes to their own lives, contradict
their own teachings. 15
Five centuries later, Epictetus echoed this view:
A carpenter does not come up to you and say, "Listen to me discourse
about the art of carpentry,'' but he makes a contract for a house and
builds it . . . . Do the same thing yourself. Eat like a man, drink like a
man . . . get married, have children, take part in civic life, learn how to
put up with insults, and tolerate other people. 1 6
We can immediately foresee the consequences of this distinction, formu­
lated by the Stoics but admitted by the majority of philosophers, concerning
the relationship between theory and practice. An Epicurean saying puts it
clearly: "Vain is the word of that philosopher which does not heal any
suffering of man." 11 Philosophical theories are in the service of the philosoph­
ical life. That is why, in the Hellenistic and Roman periods, they were
reduced to a theoretical, systematic, highly concentrated nucleus, capable of
exercising a strong psychological effect, and easy enough to handle so that it
might always be kept close at hand ( procheiro11). 1 8 Philosophical discourse was
not systematic because it wanted to provide a total, systematic explanation of
the whole of reality. Rather, it was systematic in order that it might provide
the mind with a small number of principles, tightly linked together, which
derived greater persuasive force and mnemonic effectiveness precisely from
s u c: h systcm111 ii11 1 ion. Short sayings summed up, sometimes in striking form,

268

Themes

the essential dogmas, so that the student might easily relocate himself within
the fundamental disposition in which he was to live.
Does the philosophical life, then, consist only in the application, at every
moment, of well-studied theorems, in order to resolve life's problems? As a
matter of fact, when we reflect on what the philosophical life implies, we
realize that there is an abyss between philosophical theory and philosophizing
as living action. To take a simi l ar case: it may seem as though artists, in their
creative acti vity, do nothing bu t apply rules, yet there is an immeasurable
distance between artistic creation and the abstract theory of art. In philo­
sophy, however, we are not dealing with the mere creation of a work of art:
the goal is rather to transform ourselves. The act of living in a genuinely
philosophical way thus corresponds to an order of reality totally different
from that of philosophical discourse.
In Stoicism, as in Epicureanism, philosophizing was a continuous act,
permanent and identical with life itself, which had to be renewed at each
instant. For both schools, this act could be defined as an orientation of the
attention.
In Stoicism, attention was oriented toward the pur i ty of one's intentions.
In other words, its objective was the conform i ty of our individual will with
reason, or the will of universal nature. In E pic ureanism, by contrast, attention
was oriented toward plea sure, which is, in the last an alysi s , the plea su re of
existing. In order to realize this state of attention, however, a number of
exercises were necessary: intense meditation on fundamental dogmas, the
ever-renewed awareness of the finitude of life, examination of one's con­
science, and, above all, a specific attitude toward time.
Both the Stoics and the Epicureans advised us to live in the present,
letting ourselves be nei th er troubled by the past, nor worried by the
u ncertainty of the future. For both these schools of thought, the present
sufficed for h a pp i ness , because it was the only reality which belon gs to us and
depends on us. Stoics and Epicureans agree d in recognizing the infinite value
of each instant : for them, wisdom is just as perfect and complete in one
instant as it is throughout an eternity . In particular, for the Stoic sage, the
totality of the cosmos is contained an d implied in each instant. Moreover, we
not only can but we must be happy right 11ow. The matter is ur gent , for the
future is uncertain and death is a constant threat: "While we're waiting
to l i ve , life passes us by." 1'1 Such an attitude can o n l y be understood if we
assume that there was, i n ancient philosophy, a sharp awareness of
the i nfinite, incommensurable va l ue of existence. Ex ist i ng within the
cosmos, in the un i q u e reality of the cosmic e ven t , was he l d to be i n fin itely
precious.
Thus, as we have seen , p h i loso p h y in the 1-lellcnistic nnd Greek period rook

as far back as Socrates. There was a Socratic style of life (which the Cynics
were to imitate), and the Socratic dialogue was an exercise which brought
Socrates' interlocutor to put himself in question, to take care of himself, and
to make his soul as beautiful and wise as possible.20 Similarly, Plato defined
philosophy as a training for death, and the philosopher as the person who
does not fear death, because he contemplates the totality of time and of
being.21
It is sometimes claimed that Aristotle was a pure theoretician, but for him,
too, philosophy was incapable of being reduced to philosophical discourse, or
to a body of knowledge. Rather, philosophy for Aristotle was a quality of the
mind, the result of an inner transformation. The form of life preached by
Aristotle was the life according to the mind. 22
We must not, therefore, as is done all too often, imagine that philosophy
was completely transformed during the Hellenistic period, whether after the
Macedonian domination over the Greek cities, or during the imperial period.
On the one hand, it is not the case, as tenacious, widely-held cliches would
have us believe, that the Greek city-state died after 330 BC, and political life
along with it. Above all, the conception of philosophy as an art and form of
living is not linked to political circumstances, or to a need for escape
mechanisms and inner liberty, in order to compensate for lost political
freedom. Already for Socrates and his disciples, philosophy was a mode of
life, and a technique of inner living. Philosophy did not change its essence
throughout the entire course of its history in antiquity.
In general, historians of philosophy pay little attention to the fact that
ancient philosophy was, first and foremost, a way of life. They consider
philosophy as, above all, philosophical discourse. How can the origins of this
prejudice be explained? I believe it is linked to the evolution of philosophy
itself in the Middle Ages and in modem times.
Christianity played a considerable role in this phenomenon. From its very
beginnings - that is, from the second century AD on - Christianity had
presented itself as a philosophy: the Christian way of lifc.23 Indeed, the very
fact that Christianity was able to present itself as a philosophy confirms the
assertion that philosophy was conceived in antiquity as a way of life. If to do
philosophy was to live in conformity with the law of reason, so the argument
went, the Christian was a philosopher, since he lived in conformity with the
law of the Logos - divine reason.24 In order to present itself as a philosophy,
Christianity was obliged to integrate elements borrowed from ancient philo­
sophy. It had to make the Logos of the gospel according to John coincide with
Stoic cosmic reason, and subsequently also with the Aristotelian or Platonic
intellect. It also had to integrate philosophical spiritual exercises into Chris­
tian life. The phenomenon of integration appears very clearly in Clement of
Alexnnd rin, and was intensely developed in the monastic movement, where
we find l hl.' S1oico/ Plntonic exercises of attention to oneself ( prosoche),

270

Themes

meditation, examination of conscience, and the training for death. We also
re-encounter the high value accorded to peace of mind and impassibility.
The Middle Ages was to inherit the conception of monastic life as Christian
philosophy, that is, as a Christian way of life. As Dom Jean Leclerq has
written: "As much as in antiquity, philosophia in the monastic Middle Ages
designates not a theory or a way of knowing, but a lived wisdom, a way of
living according to reason." 25 At the same time, however, the medieval
universities witnessed the elimination of the confusion which had existed in
primitive Christianity between theology, founded on the rule of faith,
and traditional philosophy, founded on reason. Philosophy was now no longer
the supreme science, but the "servant of theology; " it supplied the latter
with the conceptual, logical, physical, and metaphysical materials it needed.
The Faculty of Arts became no more than a preparation for the Faculty of
Theology.
If we disregard, for the moment, the monastic usage of the word philn­
sophia, we can say that philosophy in the Middle Ages had become a purely
theoretical and abstract activity. It was no longer a way of life. Ancient
spiritual exercises were no longer a part of philosophy, but found themselves
integrated into Christian spirituality. It is in this form that we encounter them
once again in the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius. 26 Neoplatonic mysticism
was prolonged into Christian mysticism, especially among such Rhineland
Dominicans as Meister Eckhardt.
Thus, the Middle Ages saw a radical change in the content of philosophy
as compared to antiquity. Moreover, from the medieval period on, theology
and philosophy were taught in those universities which had been creations of
the medieval church. Even though attempts have been made to use the word
"university" in reference to ancient educational institutions, it appears that
neither the notion nor the reality of the university ever existed during
antiquity, with the possible exception of the Orient near the end of the late
antique period.
One of the characteristics of the university is that it is made up of
professors who train professors, or professionals training professionals. Edu­
cation was thus no longer directed toward people who were to be educated
with a view to becoming fully developed human beings, but to specialists, in
order that they might learn how to train other specialists. This is the danger
of "Scholasticism," that philosophical tendency which began to be sketched
at the end of antiquity, developed in the Middle Ages, and whose presence is
still recognizable in philosophy today.
The scholastic university, dominated by theology, would continue to
function up to the end of the eighteenth century, but from the sixteenth to
the eighteenth centuries, genuinely creative philosop h ica l acti v i t y wo u l d
develop outside the university, in the persons of Descartes, Spinoza, Mnk'­
branche, and Leibn iz. Phi losophy l ltuH reconquered it 11 llll l onom y v i11-1\-vis

theology, but this movement - born as a reaction against medieval Scholasti­
cism - was situated on the same terrain as the latter. In opposition to one kind
of theoretical philosophical discourse, there arose yet another theoretical
discourse.
From the end of the eighteenth century onward, a new philosophy made
its appearance within the university, in the persons of Wolff, Kant, Fichte,
Schelling, and Hegel. From now on, with a few rare exceptions like
Schopenhauer or Nietzsche, philosophy would be indissolubly linked to the
university. We see this in the case of Bergson, Husserl, and Heidegger. This
fact is not without importance. Philosophy - reduced, as we have seen, to
philosophical discourse - develops from this point on in a different atmo­
sphere and environment from that of ancient philosophy. In modern univer­
sity philosophy, philosophy .is obviously no longer a way of life or form of life
- unless it be the form of life of a professor of philosophy. Nowadays,
philosophy's element and vital milieu is the state educational institution; this
has always been, and may still be, a danger for its independence. In the words
of Schopenhauer:
Generally speaking, university philosophy is mere fencing in front of a
mirror. In the last analysis, its goal is to give students opinions which
are to the liking of the minister who hands out the Chairs . . . . As a
result, this state-financed philosophy makes a joke of philosophy. And
yet, if there is one thing desirable in this world, it is to see a ray of light
fall onto the darkness of our lives, shedding some kind of light on the
mysterious enigma of our existence. 27
Be this as it may, modern philosophy is first and foremost a discourse
developed in the classroom, and then consigned to books. It is a text which
requires exegesis.
This is not to say that modern philosophy has not rediscovered, by different
paths, some of the existential aspects of ancient philosophy. Besides, it must
be added that these aspects have never completely disappeared. For example,
it was no accident that Descartes entitled one of his ·works Meditations. They
are indeed meditations - meditatio in the sense of exercise - according to the
spirit of the Christian philosophy of St Augustine, and Descartes recommends
that they be practiced over a certain period of time. Beneath its systematic,
geometrical form, Spinoza's Ethics corresponds rather well to what systematic
philosophical discourse could mean for the Stoics. One could say that
Spinoza's discourse, nourished on ancient philosophy, teaches man how to
transform, radically and concretely, his own being, and how to accede to
beatitude. The figure of the sage, moreover, appears in the final lines of the
Ethics: "the sage, in so far as he is regarded as such, is scarcely at all disturbed
in spirit, h u t , hring con sci o u s of himself, and of God, and of things, by a

272

Themes

certain eternal necessity, never ceases to be, but always possesses true
acquiescence of the spirit." 28 The philosophies of Nietzsche and of Schopen­
·
hauer are also invitations to radically transform our way of life. Both men
were, moreover, thinkers steeped in the tradition of ancient philosophy.
According to the Hegelian model, human consciousness has a purely
historical character; and the only lasting thing is the action of the spirit itself,
as it constantly engenders new forms. Under the influence of Hegel's method,
the i d ea arose am o ng Marx and th e young Hegelians that theory cannot be
detached from practice, and that it is man's action upon the world which gives
rise to his representations. In the twentieth century, the philosophy of
Bergson and the phenomenology of Husserl appeared less as systems than as
methods for transforming our perception of the world. Finally, the movement
of thought inaugurated by Heidegger and carried on by existentialism seeks in theory and in principle - to engage man's freedom. and action in the
philosophical process, although, in the last analysis, it too is primarily a
philosophical discourse.
One could say that what differentiates ancient from modern philosophy is
the fact that, in ancient philosophy, it was not only Chrysippus or Epicurus
who, just because they had developed a philosophical discourse, were
considered philosophers. Rather, every person who lived according to the
precepts of Chrysippus or Epicurus was every bit as much of a philosopher
as they. A politician like Cato of Utica was considered a philosopher and even
a sage, even though he wrote and taught nothing, because his life was
perfectly Stoic. The same was true of Roman statesmen like Rutilius Rufus
and Qµintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex, who practiced Stoicism by showing
an exemplary disinterestedness and humanity in the administration of the
provinces entrusted to them. These men were not merely examples of
morality, but men who lived the totality of Stoicism, speaking like Stoics
(Cicero tells us explicitly29 that they refused to use a certain type of rhetoric
in the trials in which they testified), and looking at the world like Stoics; in
other words, trying to live in accord with cosmic reason. They sought to
realize the ideal of Stoic wisdom: a certain way of being human, of living
according to reason, within the cosmos and along with other human beings.
What constituted the object of their efforts was not merely ethics, but the
human being as a whole.
Ancient philosophy proposed to mankind an art of living. By contrast,
modern philosophy appears above all as the construction of a technical jargon
reserved for specialists.
Everyone is free to define philosophy as he likes, to choose whatever
philosophy he wishes, or to invent - if he can - whatever philosophy he may
think valid. Descartes and Spinoza still remained faithful to the ancient
definition: for them, ph i l oso phy wai; "the 1m1cticc of w i sdo m . " 111 I f, fo l l ow in g

the state of wisdom, we shall find in the ancient traditions of the various
philosophical schools - Socratism, Platonism, Aristotelianism, Epicureanism,
Stoicism, Cynicism, Skepticism - models of life, fundamental forms in
accordance with which reason may be applied to human existence, and
archetypes of the quest for wisdom. It is precisely this plurality of ancient
schools that is precious. It allows us to compare the consequences of all the
various possible fundamental attitudes of reason, and offers a privileged
field for experimentation. This, of course, presupposes that we reduce

these philosophies to their spirit and essence, detaching them from their
outmoded cosmological or mythical elements, and disengaging from them the
fundamental propositions that they themselves considered essential. This is
not, by the way, a matter of choosing one or the other of these traditions
to the exclusion of the others. Epicureanism and Stoicism, for example,
correspond to two opposite but inseparable poles of our inner life:
the demands of our moral conscience, and the flourishing of our joy in
existing.31
Philosophy in antiquity was an exercise practiced at each instant. It invites
us to concentrate on each instant of life, to become aware of the infinite value
of each present moment, once we have replaced it within the perspective of
the cosmos. The exercise of wisdom entails a cosmic dimension. Whereas the
average person has lost touch with the world, and does not see the world qua
world, but rather treats the world as a means of satisfying his desires, the sage
never ceases to have the whole constantly present to mind. He thinks and acts
within a cosmic perspective. He has the feeling of belonging to a whole which
goes beyond the limits of his individuality. In antiquity, this cosmic con­
sciousness was situated in a different perspective from that of the scientific
knowledge of the universe that could be provided by, for instance, the science
of astronomical phenomena. Scientific knowledge was objective and mathe­
matical, whereas cosmic consciousness was the result of a spiritual exercise,
which consisted in becoming aware of the place of one's individual existence
within the great current of the cosmos and the perspective of the whole, Ioli
se inserens mundo, in the words of Seneca.32 This exercise was situated not in
the absolute space of exact science, but in the lived experience of the concrete,
living, and perceiving subject.
We have here to do with two radically different kinds of relationship to the
world . We can understand the distinction between these two kinds by
recalling the opposition pointed out by HusserP3 between the rotation of the
earth, affirmed and proved scientifically, and the earth's immobility, postu­
lated both by our day-to-day experience and by transcendental/ constitutive
consciousness. For the latter, the earth is the immobile ground of our life, the
reference point of our thought, or, as Merleau-Ponty put it, "the womb of
our time and of our space." :w In the same way, nature and the cosmos are,
for our livintit llcrccption , the i n fi n i te horizon of our lives, the enigma of our

274

existence which, as Lucretius said, inspires us with ho"or et divina voluptas,
a shudder and a divine pleasure. As Goethe put it in admirable verses:
The best part of man is the shudder.
However dearly the world makes him pay for this emotion,
He is seized by amazement when he feels the Prodigious. 35
Ancient philosophical traditions can pro v i d e guidance in our relationship to
ourselves, to the cosmos, and to other human beings. In the mentality of
modem historians, there is no cliche more firmly anchored, and more difficult
to uproot, than the idea according to which ancient philosophy was an escape
mechanism , an act of falling back upon oneself. In the <."Ilse of t h e Platonists,
it was an escape into the heaven of ideas, into the refusal of politics in the
case of the Epicureans, into the submission to fate in the case of the Stoics.
This way of looking at things is, in fact, doubly false. In the first place,
ancient philosophy was always a philosophy practiced in a group, whether in
the case of the Pythagorean communities, Platonic love, Epicurean friendship,
or Stoic spiritual direction. Ancient philosophy required a common effort,
community of research, mutual assistance, and spiritual support. Above all,
philosophers - even, in the last analysis, the Epicureans - never gave up
having an effect on their cities, transforming society, and serving their
citizens, who frequently accorded them praise, the vestiges of which are
preserved for us by inscriptions. Political ideas may have differed from school
to school, but the concern for having an effect on city or state, king or
emperor, always remained constant. This is particularly true of Stoicism, and

can easily be seen in many of the texts of Marcus Aurelius. Of the three tasks
which must be kept in mind at each instant, alongside vigilance over one's
thoughts and consent to the events imposed by destiny, an essential place is
accorded to the duty always to act in the service of the human community;
that is, to act in accordance with justice. This last requirement is, moreover,
intimately linked to the two others. It is one and the same wisdom which
conforms itself to cosmic wisdom and to the reason in which human beings
participate. This concern for living in the service of the human community,
and for acting in accordance with justice, is an essential element of every
philosophical life. In other words, the phi losophical life normally entails a
communitary engagement. This last is probably the hardest part to carry out.
The trick is to maintain oneself on the level of reason, and not allow oneself
to be blinded by po l itical passions, anger, resentments, or prejudices. To he
sure, there is an equilibrium - almost impossible to achieve - between the
inner peace brought about by wisdom, and the passions to w h ic h the sight o f
the injustices, sufferings, and mi ser y of m a n k i n d cann ot h e l p but give rise.
Wisdom, ho w e v e r , consists in precisely such nn equ i libri u m , nnd in n e r l'cnce

Such is the lesson of ancient philosophy: an invitation to each human being
to transform himself. Philosophy is a conversion, a transformation of one's
way of being and living, and a quest for wisdom. This is not an easy matter.
As Spinoza wrote at the end of the Ethics:
If the way which I have pointed out as leading to this result seems
exceedingly hard, it may nevertheless be discovered. It must indeed be
hard, since it is so seldom found. How would it be possible, if salvation
were easy to find, and could without great labour be found, that it
should be neglected by almost everybody? But all excellent things are as
difficult as they are rare.36

Postscript: An Interview with Pierre
Hadot

M. C.

Pierre Hadot, you were born

in Reims, France, in 1 922. What were

the earliest and strongest influences on your spiritual and intellectual devel­
opment?

P.H.

I received a very intense Catholic religious education. I gradually

became detached from it, but it played a considerable role in my formation,
both because of the first impressions it made upon me, and because of the
problems it raised for me.
The first philosophy

I came across was Thomism, which I encountered

especially in the books of Jacques Maritain; thus it was a kind of Aristotelian­
ism tinged with Neoplatonism . I think it was a good thing for me to have
begun my philosophical studies with a highly systematic, structured philo­
sophy, which was based on a long ancient and medieval tradition. It gave me
a lasting distaste for philosophies which don't clearly define the vocabulary
they use. Besides, it was thanks to Thomism, and especially to E tienne
Gilson ,! that I discovered very early on the fundamental distinction between
essence and existence, which is dear to existentialism .
At the time,

I was very much influenced by Newman's Grammar ofAssent.

Newman shows in th is work that it's not the same thing to give one's assent
to an affirmation which one understands in a p urely abstract way, and to give
one's assent while engaging one's entire being, and "realizing" - in the
English sense of the word - with one's heart and one's imagination, j ust what
this affirmation means for us. This distinction between real and notional
assent underlies my research on spiritual exercises.
My religious education also made me come face to face with the phenome­
non of mysticism, which I probably didn't understand at the time, but which
has continued to fascinate me all my life.
We would need a very long discussion i f we were seriously to approach the
problem posed by the survival of Christianity in the modern world. From the
point of view of my uwn personal experience, I can say that one of the great

278

Postscript

difficulties of Christianity - I'm thinking here of the textual criticism of the
Bible - was what revealed to me a more general problem, which could be
formulated in the following terms: is modem man still able to understand the
texts of antiquity, and live according to them? Has there been a definitive
break between the contemporary world and ancient tradition?
While studying at the Sorbonne in 1 946 and 1947, I discovered Bergson,
Marxism, and existentialism, three models which have had a strong influence
on my conception of philosophy. Bergsonism was not an abstract, conceptual
philosophy, but rather took the form of a new way of seeing the world, and
of transforming one's perception. Existentialism - Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau­
Ponty, Albert Camus; but also Gabriel Marcel - made me become aware of
my simultaneous engagement in the world of experience, in perception, in the
experience of my body, and in social and political life. Marxism, finally,
proposed a theory of philosophy in which theory and praxis were intimately
linked, and where daily life was never separated from theoretical reflection. I
found this aspect of Marxism very seductive, but economic materialism was
profoundly alien to me. I also had other influences: Montaigne, whom I have
been reading since my adolescence, and the poet Rilke; for a while, I thought
about writing my thesis on "The Relationship between Rilke and Heidegger. "
M. C. Your career has always taken place more or less o n the outskirts o f the
French intellectual "establishment." You took your diploma from the Ecole
Pratique des Hautes Etudes in 196 1 , and you then became director of studies
at the same institution, where you remained from 1964 on. In 1 982, you were
elected to the chair of the History of Hellenistic and Roman Thought at the
College de France. Now, in France, this is the most prestigious position
which a historian of philosophy can obtain, and y ou arrived there without
passing through the almost obligatory stage of the Ecole Normale Superieure,
or any other of the so-called "great schools."
Did these somewhat unusual circumstances contribute anything to your
conception of philosophy? I'm thinking in particular of your remarks on the
negative influence which the university has exerted on philosophy.
P.H. My remarks on the negative influence which the university has exerted
on philosophy have nothing to do with the fact that my career has taken place
outside the university. Generally speaking, I admired the professors who
taught me philosophy at the Sorbonne, from either an intellectual or a human
point of view - or both. They devoted themselves to the task of teaching with
exemplary dedication, and they had a highly-developed moral conscience. I'm
thinking here of men like Emile Brehier,2 R. Bayer, jean Wahl,3 Paul Ricoeur,
Maurice de Gandillac,• Jean Hyppolite,5 R. Le Senne, Louis Lavelle, Maurice
Merlcau-Ponty, and j. Vuillemin.
The idea of a conflict between philosophy and the teaching of philosophy
goes back to my youth . I t hi n k I ca me ac ross it in C :h11rlcs Pc((uy, who said :
"Philosophy doesn't go to philosophy d111111c11," 1md l:crt11inly in j&1ClJUC11

Postscript

Maritain, who wrote: "Thomist metaphysics is called 'Scholastic' after its
most severe trial. Scholastic pedagogy is its own worst enemy: it always has
to triumph over its intimate adversary, the professor." Ever since I started
doing philosophy, I've always believed that philosophy was a concrete act,
which changed our perception of the world, and our life: not the construction
of a system. It is a life, not a discourse.
M. C. Your own philosophical trajectory is rather remarkable. To begin
with, in the 1950s, you wrote reviews of Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and
Berdiaev. At the same time, you were making a name for yourself on the one
hand in Latin Patristics and textual criticism, and on the other as a specialist
on Plotin us. In 19 57, you presented a remarkable paper at the meeting of the
Fondation Hardt devoted to Plotinus; this was followed, in 1 963 by your first
book, Plotinus or the Simplicity of Vision.6 In 1 96 1 , in collaboration with Paul
Henry, you had translated and given a copious commentary on the theological
treatises of the Latin church Father Marius Victorious. The year 1 968 saw
the publication of your monumental work Porphyre et Victorinus,1 in which
you gave a critical edition, with translation and commentary, of a commentary
on Plato's Parmenides, which you attributed for the first time to Porphyry of
Tyre. But this wasn't all; the work contained a summa of Neoplatonic
metaphysics, in which you covered the immensely complex, hierarchic
conceptual constructions of post-Plotinian metaphysics. After you were
named to the College de France, you devoted your attention mainly to the
seemingly more simple philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism, as well as
continuing your study of Plotinus.
Perhaps your career could be summed up as follows: beginning with the
bone-dry discipline of textual criticism, you then moved on to master the
ontological complexities of Neoplatonism; surely among the most complicated
creations of the human spirit. Then, however, it's as if you had turned back,
in a way, to your point of departure: from this point on, it's no longer the
great speculative edifices which occupy your attention, but those philosophers
who teach us how to live: Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Lucretius, and, of
course, your beloved Plotinus. Wouldn't you say that your own philosophical
trajectory can serve as a paradigm for the "return to simplicity," the
importance of which you have stressed in your teaching?
P.H. I'd be inclined to look at my intellectual and spiritual itinerary
somewhat differently. From 1 942 to 1 946, I was only interested in meta­
physics and in mysticism, in all their forms: Christian first and foremost, but
also Arabic, Hindu, and Neoplatonist. It was my interest in mysticism that
led me to Plotinus, and to the great Plotinian specialist Paul Henry. I went
to see him in 1 946, so that he could guide me in my Plotinian studies. He
was interested, above all, in the influence of Plotinus on St Augustine, and
on Christianity in general; he had written a book on the subject entitled Plotin
et / 'OcciJmt." He ndvised me to study Marius Victorious, in the belief that I

280

Postscript

would find, in the almost incomprehensible Latin of this ecclesiastical author,
some translated fragments of Plotinus. He suggested that we edit the
theological works of Victorious together, leaving the translation and the
commentary up to me. Thus, he was the one who initiated me to textual
criticism and philological studies; being a pure philosopher, I had had no
preparation in either of these fields, and the only knowledge I had of Greek
and Latin was what I had been taught by my secondary-school teachers.
All this was a long way from mysticism. I can say that I worked for twenty
years on a subject that I had not chosen; I was interested in it, of course, but
not fascinated by it. It was then that I learned how to read Latin manuscripts
and, thanks to Paul Henry, how to prepare a critical edition. I also tried to
understand, and explain as well as I could, the text of Victorious. My book
Porphyre et Victorinus was the result of this exegetical work, and in it I showed
that Victorious was the disciple of Porphyry rather than of Plotinus.
What attracted me in Wittgenstein - whom I first read around 1 960 was
the problem of mysticism, which he mentions in the last pages of the
Tractalus. My reading of Wittgenstein was very stimulating for me, and it
brought about my lasting interest in the question of "language games," which
are, he tells us, "forms of life." These ideas had a great deal of influence on
my subsequent studies of ancient philosophy.
I returned to the mysticism of Plotinus in 1 963, when Georges and Angele
de Radkowski asked me to write the little book entitled Plotin ou la simplicite
du regard.
When, in 1 964, I was elected to the Fifth Section of the Ecole Pratique des
Hautes E tudes,9 my colleagues viewed me above all as the translator of
Victorin us, and it was natural for me to have been elected to the chair of Latin
Patristics. Among other factors, this explains how I came to publish an edition
and translation of the Apologia David of Bishop Ambrose of Milan.10 I must
confess, however, that Latin Patristics didn't really interest me. Fortunately,
my colleagues agreed to change the title of my chair, which became
"Theologies and Mysticisms of Hellenistic Greece and of the End of
Antiquity." Thus I was able to return to the mystical passages of Plotinus, on
which I commented before my auditors for many years.
However, it was also at this time that my relationship with Plotinus began
to become more complex, and that I arrived at my present position. On the
one hand, I believe that this great author has yet to be explained in the
detailed way he deserves, and that's why I have undertaken the translation
with commentary of the totality of his works. Moreover, the phenomenon of
mysticism, which is so striking in Plotinus, continues to intrigue me. Y ct, as
I grow older, Plotinus speaks to me less and less, if I may say so I h a ve
become considerably detached from him. From 1 970 on , I have felt very
strongly that it was E p ic u rcn ni s m and S toicism which could nouri11h the

how I came to write my book on spiritual exercises. Indeed, here at the end
of the century - and no one is more surprised at this than myself - we are
witnessing an increasing interest in these two philosophies on the part of the
reading public. This is a remarkable phenomenon, hard to explain.
To sum up my inner evolution, I would say the following: in 1 946, I naively
believed that I, too, could relive the Plotinian mystical experience. But I later
realized that this was an illusion. The conclusion of my book Plotinus already
hinted that the idea of the "purely spiritual" is untenable. It is true that there
is something ineffable in human existence, but this ineffable is within our very
perception of the world, in the mystery of our existence and that of the
cosmos. Still, it can lead to an experience which could be qualified as mystical.
M. C. What do the expressions "philosophy" and "living a philosophical
life" signify for you?
P.H. For me, the word "philosophy" corresponds first of all to an historical
phenomenon. In was the Greeks who created the word, probably in the sixth
or fifth century BC, and it was Plato who gave it its strongest meaning:
philo-sophia, "love of wisdom," the wisdom which one lacks. Since that time
there has been an intellectual, spiritual, and social phenomenon, which has
taken on a variety of forms, and which has been called philosophy. From this
point of view, it is legitimate to ask whether there exists a "philosophy"
outside of the Western tradition, or of the Arabic tradition, insofar as the
latter is the inheritor of Greek philosophy.
Now, an historical phenomenon is in constant evolution. Contemporary
"philosophy" is obviously very different from the "philosophy" of Socrates
and Plato, j ust as contemporary Christianity is very different from the
Evangelistic message. Is this evolution a good thing? Is it an evil? I won't go
into that. I do think, however, that it is always legitimate to go back to the
origins, in order better to understand the meaning of a phenomenon, and that
is what I try to do.
I have tried to define what philosophy was for a person in antiquity. In my
view, the essential characteristic of the phenomenon "philosophy" in antiquity
was that at that time a philosopher was, above all, someone who lived in a
philosophical way. In other words, the philosopher was someone whose life
was guided by his or her reason , and who was a practitioner of the moral
virtues. This is obvious, for example, from the portrait Alcibiades gives of
Socrates at the end of Plato's Symposium. We can also observe it in Xenophon,
where Hippias asks Socrates for a definition of j ustice. Socrates replies:
"Instead of talking about it, I make it appear through my actions." Originally,
then, philosophy is above all the choice of a form of life, to which
philosophical discourse then gives justifications and theoretical foundations.
Philosophical discourse is not the same thing as philosophy: the Stoics said
so explicitly, and the other schools admitted it implicitly. True, there can be
no philosophy without so m e discourse - either i n ner or outward - on the part

282

Postscript

of the philosopher. This can take the fonn of pedagogical activity carried out
on others, of inner meditation, or of the discursive explanation of intuitive
contemplation. But this discourse is not the essential part of philosophy, and
it will have value only if it has a relationship with philosophical life. As an
Epicurean sentence puts it: "The discourse of philosophers is in vain, unless
it heals some passion of the soul."
M. C. Are spiritual exercises still possible today? They were thought up in
the very distant past, as responses to specific social structures and material
conditions, but our current living conditions bear very little resemblance to
those of antiquity. The spiritual exercises of the Stoics and the Epicureans,
for example, are the consequences of the basic hypotheses of each school: on
the one hand, faith in the providential Logos; on the other, atomism, belief
in chance, and denial of post-mortem existence. Nowadays, however, we may
no longer believe in these hypotheses. Is it still possible to practice the
spiritual exercises of antiquity, separating them from the systems of which
they were a part, and substituting our own basic hypotheses for the outmoded
ones of antiquity?
Let's take the example of injustice. One of the greatest sources of pain for
modern man is, I would think, the suffering of innocent people. Every day,
the media overwhelm us with images of this suffering, and we witness it every
day in the streets of our cities. How can we avoid giving in to despair if we
no longer believe, like Marcus Aurelius, in a divine providence, consubstantial
with ourselves, which arranges everything for the best, and ensures that
injustices are only apparent?
P. H. To reply to your question, I refer you to the beginning of the chapter
entitled "Spiritual exercises," where I quote the passage from the diary of
Georges Friedmann which he quotes in his book La Puissance et la Sagesse: 1 1
" A 'spiritual exercise' every day - either alone o r else i n th e company of
someone who also wants to improve himself. . . . Step out of duration . . . try
to get rid of your own passions." I think this testimony suffices to prove that
spiritual exercises arc still being practiced in our day and age.
Spiritual exercises do not correspond to specific social structures or material
conditions. They have been, and continue to be, practiced in every age, in the
most widely diverse milieus, and in widely different latitudes: China, Japan,
India; among the Christians, Muslims, and Jews.
If one admits, as I do, that the various philosophical schools of antiquity
were characterized above all by their choice of a form of life, which is then
justified after the fact by a given systematic construction (for instance,
Stoicism is the choice of an attitude of coherence with oneself, which is later
justified by a general theory of the coherence of the universe with itself) then it is easy to understand how one can can remain fa i t h fu l to one ' s choice
of a form of life without being obl i ged to adhere to the systemat ic construc­
t ion wh ich c l a i m s to found it. As R u yer haH w1·inen112 "Excel'' for s1,cc:ial i111s,

Postscript

283

no one is very interested in the motives of Stoicism, taken over for the most
part from Heraclitus, or in those of Epicurean ethics or Democritean
atomism. Nevertheless, as attitudes, Stoicism and Epicureanism are still very
much alive." As a matter of fact, ethics - that is to say, choosing the good is not the consequence of metaphysics, but metaphysics is the consequence of
ethics.
You give the example of injustice and the suffering of innocent people. For
M a rcus Aurelius, the fact that there is a providence (that is, simply, that there
is coherence in the world), does not mean that injustice is only an appearance.
It is quite real, and in his Meditations Marcus often expresses his anger against
liars and the unjust. For him, the discipline of action consists precisely in
acting in the service of the human community; in other words, in practicing
justice oneself and in correcting injustices. Such an attitude is independent of
any theory of providence. Besides, Marcus himself says: "Whether or not the
world is ruled by reason (and thus by providence), don't you act unreason­
ably. " He then goes on to add that if we do act according to reason, that
proves that there is also reason in the world. This is proof that it is one's
choice of life which precedes metaphysical theories, and that we can make our
choice of life, whether or not we justify it by improved or entirely new
arguments.
M. C. You often speak of "nature" or "universal nature" in the context of
the triple discipline of the Stoics. For example, according to Marcus Aurelius
we must learn "the ways and laws of . nature." What is meant here by
"nature"? Is it the "nature" in which we stroll and have picnics? The "nature"
which "makes no leaps"?
P. H. For the Stoics, nature is at the same time the program in conformity
with which the events which constitute the universe are necessarily linked to
one another, and the programmed sequence which results from them. Thus,
it is the rational order which presides over the evolution of the visible world.
It is this programming and this rationality which give the world its coherence.
To act according to nature is therefore to act in a programmed, rational
manner, in full awareness of the fact that one is a part of the cosmic whole,
as well as a part of the whole formed by the city of l:hose beings which share
in reason. On the one hand, then, it is to act in the service of the human
community, and, on the other, to consent to the general movement of the
universe. The Stoics were saying exactly the same thing as Einstein, when he
denounced the optical illusion of a person who imagines himself to be a
separate entity, while he is really a part of that whole which we call the
universe. Einstein also declared that it is our duty to open our hearts to all
living beings, and to all of nature in her magnificence.
M. C. The triple discipline of spiritual exercises is intended to lead me
towards the inner transformation of my way of seeing, and eventually, to
rest ore me ns nn integrnl and integrated part of the cosmos. According to this

284

Postscript

theory, my task is to discipline my desires, my inclinations, and my assent.
The last two domains correspond respectively to ethics - I must observe my
duties toward my fellow citizens - and to logic or epistemology: I must accept
as true only that which is freed from my subjective prejudices.
All this seems feasible enough. But as far as the discipline of desire is
concerned: it is surely true that the majority of our unhappiness comes from
our unsatisfied desires; this was taught by the Buddha, among others. But is
it really possible for me to discipline my desires; that is, to persuade myself
by means of rational considerations no longer to desire a particular object?
Let's take sexual desire as an example. If I feel desire for a woman, it is
perfectly possible for me to tell myself that I will not act according to "'J' desire;
in other words, that I will not attempt to satisfy my desire. But can I really
go further than that, and, in the presence of the desired object, command
myself not to desire it at{v longer? I have difficulties with this point.
P. H. Can purely rational considerations be effective against passion or
sexual desire? Here we return to the very idea of spiritual exercises.
What's interesting about the idea of spiritual exercises is precisely that it is nor
a matter of a purely rational consideration, but the putting in action of all kinds
of means, intended to act upon one's self. Imagination and affectivity play a
capital role here: we must represent to ourselves in vivid colors the dangers of
such-and-such a passion, and use striking formulations of ideas in order to exhort
ourselves. We must also create habits, and fortify ourselves by preparing
ourselves against hardships in advance. In Epicurean communities, people help
one another, admit their weaknesses to each other, and warn others of such-and­
such a dangerous tendency which is beginning to manifest itself in them.
All these techniques can be useful in crisis situations. Yet we must not allow
them to make us forget that what is most important is the profound
orientation of our lives, the fundamental choice of a life, which engages us
passionately. The problem is not so much to repress such-and-such a passion,
as it is to learn to see things "from above," in the grandiose perspective of
universal nature and of humanity, compared to which many passions may
appear ridiculously insignificant. It is then that rational knowledge may
become force and will, and thereby become extremely efficacious.
M. C. On May 22, 1 99 1 , you gave your last lecture at the College de France.
After some three decades of teaching, the last words you pronounced in
public were: "In the last analysis, we can scarcely talk about what is most
important."
This seems paradoxical . A fter a lifetime devoted to humanistic studies, have
you finally come to the conclusion of the Neoplatonist philosopher Damas­
cius,13 who wrote "What will be the limit of our discourse, if it is nut an
impotent silence, and the admission of our absol ute lack of k nowledge
concerning those t h i n gs about which we mny never gn i n knowlcdl(c, Hi nce
t hey o re inncce1111iblc11?

Postsm'pt

285

P.H. You're alluding to the last words of my last class: "In the final analysis,
we can scarcely talk about what is most important." I was saying that about
Plotinus, for whom the most important thing was not his teaching, but the
unutterable experience of union with the One. For Plotinus, abstract teaching
could allude to this experience, but could not lead to it. Only asceticism and
a moral life could truly prepare the soul for such a union (and here again, we
find the same opposition between philosophical discourse and the philosop­
hical life).
Obviously, however, when I used this phrase, I was hinting at my own
experience as a teacher and my experience of life. I wasn't only talking about
the experience of the ineffable among the Neoplatonists, but about a more
general experience.
Everything which is "technical" in the broad sense of the term, whether we
arc talking about the exact sciences or the humanistic sciences, is perfectly able
to be communicated by teaching or conversation. But everything that touches
the domain of the existential - which is what is most important for human
bein gs - for instance, our feeling of existence, our impressions when faced by
death, our perception of nature, our sensations, and a fortiori the mystical
experience, is not directly communicable. The phrases we use to describe them
are conventional and banal; we realize this when we try to console someone
over the loss of a loved one. That's why it often happens that a poem or a
biography are more philosophical than a philosophical treatise, simply because
they allow us to glimpse this unsayable in an indirect way. Here again, we find
the kind of mysticism evoked in Wittgenstein's Tractatus: "There is indeed the
inexpressible. This shows itself; it is the mystical."

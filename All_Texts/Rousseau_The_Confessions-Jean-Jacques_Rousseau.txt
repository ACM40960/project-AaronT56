Among the notable books of later times-we may say, without
exaggeration, of all time--must be reckoned The Confessions of
Jean Jacques Rousseau. It deals with leading personages and
transactions of a momentous epoch, when absolutism and feudalism
were rallying for their last struggle against the modern spirit, chiefly
represented by Voltaire, the Encyclopedists, and Rousseau himself-a struggle to which, after many fierce intestine quarrels and
sanguinary wars throughout Europe and America, has succeeded
the prevalence of those more tolerant and rational principles by
which the statesmen of our own day are actuated.
On these matters, however, it is not our province to enlarge; nor is
it necessary to furnish any detailed account of our author's political,
religious, and philosophic axioms and systems, his paradoxes and
his errors in logic: these have been so long and so exhaustively
disputed over by contending factions that little is left for even the
most assiduous gleaner in the field. The inquirer will find, in Mr. John
Money's excellent work, the opinions of Rousseau reviewed
succinctly and impartially. The 'Contrat Social', the 'Lattres Ecrites de
la Montagne', and other treatises that once aroused fierce
controversy, may therefore be left in the repose to which they have
long been consigned, so far as the mass of mankind is concerned,
though they must always form part of the library of the politician and

the historian. One prefers to turn to the man Rousseau as he paints
himself in the remarkable work before us.
That the task which he undertook in offering to show himself--as
Persius puts it--'Intus et in cute', to posterity, exceeded his powers, is
a trite criticism; like all human enterprises, his purpose was only
imperfectly fulfilled; but this circumstance in no way lessens the
attractive qualities of his book, not only for the student of history or
psychology, but for the intelligent man of the world. Its startling
frankness gives it a peculiar interest wanting in most other
autobiographies.
Many censors have elected to sit in judgment on the failings of this
strangely constituted being, and some have pronounced upon him
very severe sentences. Let it be said once for all that his faults and
mistakes were generally due to causes over which he had but little
control, such as a defective education, a too acute sensitiveness,
which engendered suspicion of his fellows, irresolution, an
overstrained sense of honour and independence, and an obstinate
refusal to take advice from those who really wished to befriend him;
nor should it be forgotten that he was afflicted during the greater part
of his life with an incurable disease.
Lord Byron had a soul near akin to Rousseau's, whose writings
naturally made a deep impression on the poet's mind, and probably
had an influence on his conduct and modes of thought: In some
stanzas of 'Childe Harold' this sympathy is expressed with truth and
power; especially is the weakness of the Swiss philosopher's
character summed up in the following admirable lines:
"Here the self-torturing sophist, wild Rousseau,
The apostle of affliction, he who threw
Enchantment over passion, and from woe
Wrung overwhelming eloquence, first drew
The breath which made him wretched; yet he
knew
How to make madness beautiful, and cast
O'er erring deeds and thoughts a heavenly hue
Of words, like sunbeams, dazzling as they passed

The eyes, which o'er them shed tears feelingly and
fast.
"His life was one long war with self-sought foes,
Or friends by him self-banished; for his mind
Had grown Suspicion's sanctuary, and chose,
For its own cruel sacrifice, the kind,
'Gainst whom he raged with fury strange and blind.
But he was frenzied,-wherefore, who may know?
Since cause might be which skill could never find;
But he was frenzied by disease or woe
To that worst pitch of all, which wears a reasoning
show."
One would rather, however, dwell on the brighter hues of the
picture than on its shadows and blemishes; let us not, then, seek to
"draw his frailties from their dread abode." His greatest fault was his
renunciation of a father's duty to his offspring; but this crime he
expiated by a long and bitter repentance. We cannot, perhaps, very
readily excuse the way in which he has occasionally treated the
memory of his mistress and benefactress. That he loved Madame de
Warens--his 'Mamma'--deeply and sincerely is undeniable,
notwithstanding which he now and then dwells on her improvidence
and her feminine indiscretions with an unnecessary and unbecoming
lack of delicacy that has an unpleasant effect on the reader, almost
seeming to justify the remark of one of his most lenient critics--that,
after all, Rousseau had the soul of a lackey. He possessed, however,
many amiable and charming qualities, both as a man and a writer,
which were evident to those amidst whom he lived, and will be
equally so to the unprejudiced reader of the Confessions. He had a
profound sense of justice and a real desire for the improvement and
advancement of the race. Owing to these excellences he was
beloved to the last even by persons whom he tried to repel, looking
upon them as members of a band of conspirators, bent upon
destroying his domestic peace and depriving him of the means of
subsistence.

Those of his writings that are most nearly allied in tone and spirit
to the 'Confessions' are the 'Reveries d'un Promeneur Solitaire' and
'La Nouvelle Heloise'. His correspondence throws much light on his
life and character, as do also parts of 'Emile'. It is not easy in our day
to realize the effect wrought upon the public mind by the advent of
'La Nouvelle Heloise'. Julie and Saint-Preux became names to
conjure with; their ill-starred amours were everywhere sighed and
wept over by the tender-hearted fair; indeed, in composing this work,
Rousseau may be said to have done for Switzerland what the author
of the Waverly Novels did for Scotland, turning its mountains, lakes
and islands, formerly regarded with aversion, into a fairyland peopled
with creatures whose joys and sorrows appealed irresistibly to every
breast. Shortly after its publication began to flow that stream of
tourists and travellers which tends to make Switzerland not only
more celebrated but more opulent every year. It, is one of the few
romances written in the epistolary form that do not oppress the
reader with a sense of languor and unreality; for its creator poured
into its pages a tide of passion unknown to his frigid and stilted
predecessors, and dared to depict Nature as she really is, not as she
was misrepresented by the modish authors and artists of the age.
Some persons seem shy of owning an acquaintance with this work;
indeed, it has been made the butt of ridicule by the disciples of a
decadent school. Its faults and its beauties are on the surface;
Rousseau's own estimate is freely expressed at the beginning of the
eleventh book of the Confessions and elsewhere. It might be wished
that the preface had been differently conceived and worded; for the
assertion made therein that the book may prove dangerous has
caused it to be inscribed on a sort of Index, and good folk who never
read a line of it blush at its name. Its "sensibility," too, is a little
overdone, and has supplied the wits with opportunities for satire; for
example, Canning, in his 'New Morality':
"Sweet Sensibility, who dwells enshrined
In the fine foldins of the feeling mind....
Sweet child of sickly Fancy!-her of yore
From her loved France Rousseau to exile bore;
And while 'midst lakes and mountains wild he ran,

Full of himself, and shunned the haunts of man,
Taught her o'er each lone vale and Alpine, steep
To lisp the story of his wrongs and weep."
As might be imagined, Voltaire had slight sympathy with our social
reformer's notions and ways of promulgating them, and accordingly
took up his wonted weapons--sarcasm and ridicule--against poor
Jean-Jacques. The quarrels of these two great men cannot be
described in this place; but they constitute an important chapter in
the literary and social history of the time. In the work with which we
are immediately concerned, the author seems to avoid frequent
mention of Voltaire, even where we should most expect it. However,
the state of his mind when he penned this record of his life should be
always remembered in relation to this as well as other occurrences.
Rousseau had intended to bring his autobiography down to a later
date, but obvious causes prevented this: hence it is believed that a
summary of the chief events that marked his closing years will not be
out of place here.
On quitting the Ile de Saint-Pierre he travelled to Strasbourg,
where he was warmly received, and thence to Paris, arriving in that
city on December ,
. The Prince de Conti provided him with a
lodging in the Hotel Saint-Simon, within the precincts of the Temple-a place of sanctuary for those under the ban of authority. 'Every one
was eager to see the illustrious proscript, who complained of being
made a daily show, "like Sancho Panza in his island of Barataria."
During his short stay in the capital there was circulated an ironical
letter purporting to come from the Great Frederick, but really written
by Horace Walpole. This cruel, clumsy, and ill-timed joke angered
Rousseau, who ascribed it to, Voltaire. A few sentences may be
quoted:
"My Dear Jean-Jacques,--You have renounced Geneva,
your native
place. You have caused your expulsion from Switzerland, a
country
so extolled in your writings; France has issued a warrant
against

you: so do you come to me. My states offer you a peaceful
retreat.
I wish you well, and will treat you well, if you will let me. But,
if you persist in refusing my help, do not reckon upon my
telling
any one that you did so. If you are bent on tormenting your
spirit
to find new misfortunes, choose whatever you like best. I
am a
king, and can procure them for you at your pleasure; and,
what will
certainly never happen to you in respect of your enemies, I
will
cease to persecute you as soon as you cease to take a
pride in being
persecuted. Your good friend,
"FREDERICK."
Early in
David Hume persuaded Rousseau to go with him to
England, where the exile could find a secure shelter. In London his
appearance excited general attention. Edmund Burke had an
interview with him and held that inordinate vanity was the leading
trait in his character. Mr. Davenport, to whom he was introduced by
Hume, generously offered Rousseau a home at Wootton, in
Staffordshire, near the, Peak Country; the latter, however, would only
accept the offer on condition that he should pay a rent of L
a year.
He was accorded a pension of L
by George III., but declined to
draw after the first annual payment. The climate and scenery of
Wootton being similar to those of his native country, he was at first
delighted with his new abode, where he lived with Therese, and
devoted his time to herborising and inditing the first six books of his
Confessions. Soon, however, his old hallucinations acquired
strength, and Rousseau convinced himself that enemies were bent
upon his capture, if not his death. In June,
, he wrote a violent
letter to Hume, calling him "one of the worst of men." Literary Paris
had combined with Hume and the English Government to surround

him--as he supposed --with guards and spies; he revolved in his
troubled mind all the reports and rumours he had heard for months
and years; Walpole's forged letter rankled in his bosom; and in the
spring of
he fled; first to Spalding, in Lincolnshire, and
subsequently to Calais, where he landed in May.
On his arrival in France his restless and wandering disposition
forced him continually to change his residence, and acquired for him
the title of "Voyageur Perpetuel." While at Trye, in Gisors, in
-- ,
he wrote the second part of the Confessions. He had assumed the
surname of Renou, and about this time he declared before two
witnesses that Therese was his wife--a proceeding to which he
attached the sanctity of marriage. In
he took up his abode in
Paris, where he lived continuously for seven years, in a street which
now bears his name, and gained a living by copying music.
Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, the author of 'Paul and Virginia', who
became acquainted with him in
, has left some interesting
particulars of Rousseau's daily mode of life at this period. Monsieur
de Girardin having offered him an asylum at Ermemonville in the
spring of
, he and Therese went thither to reside, but for no long
time. On the d of July, in the same year, this perturbed spirit at last
found rest, stricken by apoplexy. A rumor that he had committed
suicide was circulated, but the evidence of trustworthy witnesses,
including a physician, effectually contradicts this accusation. His
remains, first interred in the Ile des Peupliers, were, after the
Revolution, removed to the Pantheon. In later times the Government
of Geneva made some reparation for their harsh treatment of a
famous citizen, and erected his statue, modelled by his compatriot,
Pradier, on an island in the Rhone.
"See nations, slowly wise and meanly just,
To buried merit raise the tardy bust."
November,

S. W. ORSON.

I have entered upon a performance which is without example, whose
accomplishment will have no imitator. I mean to present my fellowmortals with a man in all the integrity of nature; and this man shall be
myself.
I know my heart, and have studied mankind; I am not made like
any one I have been acquainted with, perhaps like no one in
existence; if not better, I at least claim originality, and whether Nature
did wisely in breaking the mould with which she formed me, can only
be determined after having read this work.
Whenever the last trumpet shall sound, I will present myself before
the sovereign judge with this book in my hand, and loudly proclaim,
thus have I acted; these were my thoughts; such was I. With equal
freedom and veracity have I related what was laudable or wicked, I
have concealed no crimes, added no virtues; and if I have
sometimes introduced superfluous ornament, it was merely to
occupy a void occasioned by defect of memory: I may have
supposed that certain, which I only knew to be probable, but have
never asserted as truth, a conscious falsehood. Such as I was, I
have declared myself; sometimes vile and despicable, at others,
virtuous, generous and sublime; even as thou hast read my inmost
soul: Power eternal! assemble round thy throne an innumerable
throng of my fellow-mortals, let them listen to my confessions, let
them blush at my depravity, let them tremble at my sufferings; let
each in his turn expose with equal sincerity the failings, the
wanderings of his heart, and, if he dare, aver, I was better than that
man.

I was born at Geneva, in
, son of Isaac Rousseau and
Susannah Bernard, citizens. My father's share of a moderate
competency, which was divided among fifteen children, being very
trivial, his business of a watchmaker (in which he had the reputation
of great ingenuity) was his only dependence. My mother's
circumstances were more affluent; she was daughter of a Mons.
Bernard, minister, and possessed a considerable share of modesty
and beauty; indeed, my father found some difficulty in obtaining her
hand.
The affection they entertained for each other was almost as early
as their existence; at eight or nine years old they walked together
every evening on the banks of the Treille, and before they were ten,
could not support the idea of separation. A natural sympathy of soul
confined those sentiments of predilection which habit at first
produced; born with minds susceptible of the most exquisite
sensibility and tenderness, it was only necessary to encounter
similar dispositions; that moment fortunately presented itself, and
each surrendered a willing heart.
The obstacles that opposed served only to give a decree of
vivacity to their affection, and the young lover, not being able to
obtain his mistress, was overwhelmed with sorrow and despair. She
advised him to travel--to forget her. He consented--he travelled, but
returned more passionate than ever, and had the happiness to find
her equally constant, equally tender. After this proof of mutual
affection, what could they resolve?--to dedicate their future lives to
love! the resolution was ratified with a vow, on which Heaven shed
its benediction.
Fortunately, my mother's brother, Gabriel Bernard, fell in love with
one of my father's sisters; she had no objection to the match, but
made the marriage of his sister with her brother an indispensable
preliminary. Love soon removed every obstacle, and the two
weddings were celebrated the same day: thus my uncle became the
husband of my aunt, and their children were doubly cousins german.
Before a year was expired, both had the happiness to become
fathers, but were soon after obliged to submit to a separation.
My uncle Bernard, who was an engineer, went to serve in the
empire and Hungary, under Prince Eugene, and distinguished

himself both at the siege and battle of Belgrade. My father, after the
birth of my only brother, set off, on recommendation, for
Constantinople, and was appointed watchmaker to the Seraglio.
During his absence, the beauty, wit, and accomplishments of my
mother attracted a number of admirers, among whom Mons. de la
Closure, Resident of France, was the most assiduous in his
attentions.
[They were too brilliant for her situation, the minister, her
father, having bestowed great pains on her education. She was
aught
drawing, singing, and to play on the theorbo; had learning, and
wrote very agreeable verses. The following is an extempore
piece
which she composed in the absence of her husband and
brother, in a
conversation with some person relative to them, while walking
with
her sister--in--law, and their two children:
Ces deux messieurs, qui sont absens,
Nous sont chers e bien des manieres;
Ce sont nos amiss, nos amans,
Ce sont nos maris et nos freres,
Et les peres de ces enfans.
These absent ones, who just claim
Our hearts, by every tender name,
To whom each wish extends
Our husbands and our brothers are,
The fathers of this blooming pair,
Our lovers and our friends.]
His passion must have been extremely violent, since after a period
of thirty years I have seen him affected at the very mention of her
name. My mother had a defence more powerful even than her virtue;
she tenderly loved my father, and conjured him to return; his

inclination seconding his request, he gave up every prospect of
emolument, and hastened to Geneva.
I was the unfortunate fruit of this return, being born ten months
after, in a very weakly and infirm state; my birth cost my mother her
life, and was the first of my misfortunes. I am ignorant how my father
supported her loss at that time, but I know he was ever after
inconsolable. In me he still thought he saw her he so tenderly
lamented, but could never forget I had been the innocent cause of
his misfortune, nor did he ever embrace me, but his sighs, the
convulsive pressure of his arms, witnessed that a bitter regret
mingled itself with his caresses, though, as may be supposed, they
were not on this account less ardent. When he said to me, "Jean
Jacques, let us talk of your mother," my usual reply was, "Yes, father,
but then, you know, we shall cry," and immediately the tears started
from his eyes. "Ah!" exclaimed he, with agitation, "Give me back my
wife; at least console me for her loss; fill up, dear boy, the void she
has left in my soul. Could I love thee thus wert thou only my son?"
Forty years after this loss he expired in the arms of his second wife,
but the name of the first still vibrated on his lips, still was her image
engraved on his heart.
Such were the authors of my being: of all the gifts it had pleased
Heaven to bestow on them, a feeling heart was the only one that
descended to me; this had been the source of their felicity, it was the
foundation of all my misfortunes.
I came into the world with so few signs of life, that they entertained
but little hope of preserving me, with the seeds of a disorder that has
gathered strength with years, and from which I am now relieved at
intervals, only to suffer a different, though more intolerable evil. I
owed my preservation to one of my father's sisters, an amiable and
virtuous girl, who took the most tender care of me; she is yet living,
nursing, at the age of four--score, a husband younger than herself,
but worn out with excessive drinking. Dear aunt! I freely forgive your
having preserved my life, and only lament that it is not in my power
to bestow on the decline of your days the tender solicitude and care
you lavished on the first dawn of mine. My nurse, Jaqueline, is
likewise living: and in good health--the hands that opened my eyes
to the light of this world may close them at my death. We suffer

before we think; it is the common lot of humanity. I experienced more
than my proportion of it. I have no knowledge of what passed prior to
my fifth or sixth year; I recollect nothing of learning to read, I only
remember what effect the first considerable exercise of it produced
on my mind; and from that moment I date an uninterrupted
knowledge of myself.
Every night, after supper, we read some part of a small collection
of romances which had been my mother's. My father's design was
only to improve me in reading, and he thought these entertaining
works were calculated to give me a fondness for it; but we soon
found ourselves so interested in the adventures they contained, that
we alternately read whole nights together, and could not bear to give
over until at the conclusion of a volume. Sometimes, in a morning,
on hearing the swallows at our window, my father, quite ashamed of
this weakness, would cry, "Come, come, let us go to bed; I am more
a child than thou art."
I soon acquired, by this dangerous custom, not only an extreme
facility in reading and comprehending, but, for my age, a too intimate
acquaintance with the passions. An infinity of sensations were
familiar to me, without possessing any precise idea of the objects to
which they related--I had conceived nothing--I had felt the whole.
This confused succession of emotions did not retard the future
efforts of my reason, though they added an extravagant, romantic
notion of human life, which experience and reflection have never
been able to eradicate.
My romance reading concluded with the summer of
, the
following winter was differently employed. My mother's library being
quite exhausted, we had recourse to that part of her father's which
had devolved to us; here we happily found some valuable books,
which was by no means extraordinary, having been selected by a
minister that truly deserved that title, in whom learning (which was
the rage of the times) was but a secondary commendation, his taste
and good sense being most conspicuous. The history of the Church
and Empire by Le Sueur, Bossuett's Discourses on Universal History,
Plutarch's Lives, the history of Venice by Nani, Ovid's
Metamorphoses, La Bruyere, Fontenelle's World, his Dialogues of
the Dead, and a few volumes of Moliere, were soon ranged in my

father's closet, where, during the hours he was employed in his
business, I daily read them, with an avidity and taste uncommon,
perhaps unprecedented at my age.
Plutarch presently became my greatest favorite. The satisfaction I
derived from repeated readings I gave this author, extinguished my
passion for romances, and I shortly preferred Agesilaus, Brutus, and
Aristides, to Orondates, Artemenes, and Juba. These interesting
studies, seconded by the conversations they frequently occasioned
with my father, produced that republican spirit and love of liberty, that
haughty and invincible turn of mind, which rendered me impatient of
restraint or servitude, and became the torment of my life, as I
continually found myself in situations incompatible with these
sentiments. Incessantly occupied with Rome and Athens,
conversing, if I may so express myself with their illustrious heroes;
born the citizen of a republic, of a father whose ruling passion was a
love of his country, I was fired with these examples; could fancy
myself a Greek or Roman, and readily give into the character of the
personage whose life I read; transported by the recital of any
extraordinary instance of fortitude or intrepidity, animation flashed
from my eyes, and gave my voice additional strength and energy.
One day, at table, while relating the fortitude of Scoevola, they were
terrified at seeing me start from my seat and hold my hand over a
hot chafing--dish, to represent more forcibly the action of that
determined Roman.
My brother, who was seven years older than myself, was brought
up to my father's profession. The extraordinary affection they
lavished on me might be the reason he was too much neglected: this
certainly was a fault which cannot be justified. His education and
morals suffered by this neglect, and he acquired the habits of a
libertine before he arrived at an age to be really one. My father tried
what effect placing him with a master would produce, but he still
persisted in the same ill conduct. Though I saw him so seldom that it
could hardly be said we were acquainted. I loved him tenderly, and
believe he had as strong an affection for me as a youth of his
dissipated turn of mind could be supposed capable of. One day, I
remember, when my father was correcting him severely, I threw
myself between them, embracing my brother, whom I covered with

my body, receiving the strokes designed for him; I persisted so
obstinately in my protection, that either softened by my cries and
tears, or fearing to hurt me most, his anger subsided, and he
pardoned his fault. In the end, my brother's conduct became so bad
that he suddenly disappeared, and we learned some time after that
he was in Germany, but he never wrote to us, and from that day we
heard no news of him: thus I became an only son.
If this poor lad was neglected, it was quite different with his
brother, for the children of a king could not be treated with more
attention and tenderness than were bestowed on my infancy, being
the darling of the family; and what is rather uncommon, though
treated as a beloved, never a spoiled child; was never permitted,
while under paternal inspection, to play in the street with other
children; never had any occasion to contradict or indulge those
fantastical humors which are usually attributed to nature, but are in
reality the effects of an injudicious education. I had the faults
common to my age, was talkative, a glutton, and sometimes a liar,
made no scruple of stealing sweetmeats, fruits, or, indeed, any kind
of eatables; but never took delight in mischievous waste, in accusing
others, or tormenting harmless animals. I recollect, indeed, that one
day, while Madam Clot, a neighbor of ours, was gone to church, I
made water in her kettle: the remembrance even now makes me
smile, for Madame Clot (though, if you please, a good sort of
creature) was one of the most tedious grumbling old women I ever
knew. Thus have I given a brief, but faithful, history of my childish
transgressions.
How could I become cruel or vicious, when I had before my eyes
only examples of mildness, and was surrounded by some of the best
people in the world? My father, my aunt, my nurse, my relations, our
friends, our neighbors, all I had any connection with, did not obey
me, it is true, but loved me tenderly, and I returned their affection. I
found so little to excite my desires, and those I had were so seldom
contradicted, that I was hardly sensible of possessing any, and can
solemnly aver I was an absolute stranger to caprice until after I had
experienced the authority of a master.
Those hours that were not employed in reading or writing with my
father, or walking with my governess, Jaqueline, I spent with my

aunt; and whether seeing her embroider, or hearing her sing,
whether sitting or standing by her side, I was ever happy. Her
tenderness and unaffected gayety, the charms of her figure and
countenance have left such indelible impressions on my mind, that
her manner, look, and attitude are still before my eyes; I recollect a
thousand little caressing questions; could describe her clothes, her
head-dress, nor have the two curls of fine black hair which hung on
her temples, according to the mode of that time, escaped my
memory.
Though my taste, or rather passion, for music, did not show itself
until a considerable time after, I am fully persuaded it is to her I am
indebted for it. She knew a great number of songs, which she sung
with great sweetness and melody. The serenity and cheerfulness
which were conspicuous in this lovely girl, banished melancholy, and
made all round her happy.
The charms of her voice had such an effect on me, that not only
several of her songs have ever since remained on my memory, but
some I have not thought of from my infancy, as I grow old, return
upon my mind with a charm altogether inexpressible. Would any one
believe that an old dotard like me, worn out with care and infirmity,
should sometime surprise himself weeping like a child, and in a voice
querulous, and broken by age, muttering out one of those airs which
were the favorites of my infancy? There is one song in particular,
whose tune I perfectly recollect, but the words that compose the
latter half of it constantly refuse every effort to recall them, though I
have a confused idea of the rhymes. The beginning, with what I have
been able to recollect of the remainder, is as follows:
Tircis, je n'ose
Ecouter ton Chalumeau
Sous l'Ormeau;
Car on en cause
Deja dans notre hameau.
---- ---- ------------ --- un Berger
s'engager
sans danger,

Et toujours l'epine est sons la rose.
I have endeavored to account for the invincible charm my heart feels
on the recollection of this fragment, but it is altogether inexplicable. I
only know, that before I get to the end of it, I always find my voice
interrupted by tenderness, and my eyes suffused with tears. I have a
hundred times formed the resolution of writing to Paris for the
remainder of these words, if any one should chance to know them:
but I am almost certain the pleasure I take in the recollection would
be greatly diminished was I assured any one but my poor aunt
Susan had sung them.
Such were my affections on entering this life. Thus began to form
and demonstrate itself, a heart, at once haughty and tender, a
character effeminate, yet invincible; which, fluctuating between
weakness and courage, luxury and virtue, has ever set me in
contradiction to myself; causing abstinence and enjoyment, pleasure
and prudence, equally to shun me.
This course of education was interrupted by an accident, whose
consequences influenced the rest of my life. My father had a quarrel
with M. G----, who had a captain's commission in France, and was
related to several of the Council. This G----, who was an insolent,
ungenerous man, happening to bleed at the nose, in order to be
revenged, accused my father of having drawn his sword on him in
the city, and in consequence of this charge they were about to
conduct him to prison. He insisted (according to the law of this
republic) that the accuser should be confined at the same time; and
not being able to obtain this, preferred a voluntary banishment for
the remainder of his life, to giving up a point by which he must
sacrifice his honor and liberty.
I remained under the tuition of my uncle Bernard, who was at that
time employed in the fortifications of Geneva. He had lost his eldest
daughter, but had a son about my own age, and we were sent
together to Bossey, to board with the Minister Lambercier. Here we
were to learn Latin, with all the insignificant trash that has obtained
the name of education.

Two years spent in this village softened, in some degree, my
Roman fierceness, and again reduced me to a state of childhood. At
Geneva, where nothing was exacted, I loved reading, which was,
indeed, my principal amusement; but, at Bossey, where application
was expected, I was fond of play as a relaxation. The country was so
new, so charming in my idea, that it seemed impossible to find
satiety in its enjoyments, and I conceived a passion for rural life,
which time has not been able to extinguish; nor have I ever ceased
to regret the pure and tranquil pleasures I enjoyed at this place in my
childhood; the remembrance having followed me through every age,
even to that in which I am hastening again towards it.
M. Lambercier was a worthy, sensible man, who, without
neglecting our instruction, never made our acquisitions
burthensome, or tasks tedious. What convinces me of the rectitude
of his method is, that notwithstanding my extreme aversion to
restraint, the recollection of my studies is never attended with
disgust; and, if my improvement was trivial, it was obtained with
ease, and has never escaped memory.
The simplicity of this rural life was of infinite advantage in opening
my heart to the reception of true friendship. The sentiments I had
hitherto formed on this subject were extremely elevated, but
altogether imaginary. The habit of living in this peaceful manner soon
united me tenderly to my cousin Bernard; my affection was more
ardent than that I had felt for my brother, nor has time ever been able
to efface it. He was a tall, lank, weakly boy, with a mind as mild as
his body was feeble, and who did not wrong the good opinion they
were disposed to entertain for the son of my guardian. Our studies,
amusements, and tasks, were the same; we were alone; each
wanted a playmate; to separate would in some measure, have been
to annihilate us. Though we had not many opportunities of
demonstrating our attachment to each other, it was certainly
extreme; and so far from enduring the thought of separation, we
could not even form an idea that we should ever be able to submit to
it. Each of a disposition to be won by kindness, and complaisant,
when not soured by contradiction, we agreed in every particular. If,
by the favor of those who governed us he had the ascendant while in
their presence, I was sure to acquire it when we were alone, and this

preserved the equilibrium so necessary in friendship. If he hesitated
in repeating his task, I prompted him; when my exercises were
finished, I helped to write his; and, in our amusements, my
disposition being most active, ever had the lead. In a word, our
characters accorded so well, and the friendship that subsisted
between us was so cordial, that during the five years we were at
Bossey and Geneva we were inseparable: we often fought, it is true,
but there never was any occasion to separate us. No one of our
quarrels lasted more than a quarter of an hour, and never in our lives
did we make any complaint of each other. It may be said, these
remarks are frivolous; but, perhaps, a similiar example among
children can hardly be produced.
The manner in which I passed my time at Bossey was so
agreeable to my disposition, that it only required a longer duration
absolutely to have fixed my character, which would have had only
peaceable, affectionate, benevolent sentiments for its basis. I believe
no individual of our kind ever possessed less natural vanity than
myself. At intervals, by an extraordinary effort, I arrived at sublime
ideas, but presently sunk again into my original languor. To be loved
by every one who knew me was my most ardent wish. I was
naturally mild, my cousin was equally so, and those who had the
care of us were of similiar dispositions. Everything contributed to
strengthen those propensities which nature had implanted in my
breast, and during the two years I was neither the victim nor witness
of any violent emotions.
I knew nothing so delightful as to see every one content, not only
with me, but all that concerned them. When repeating our catechism
at church, nothing could give me greater vexation, on being obliged
to hesitate, than to see Miss Lambercier's countenance express
disapprobation and uneasiness. This alone was more afflicting to me
than the shame of faltering before so many witnesses, which,
notwithstanding, was sufficiently painful; for though not oversolicitous
of praise, I was feelingly alive to shame; yet I can truly affirm, the
dread of being reprimanded by Miss Lambercier alarmed me less
than the thought of making her uneasy.
Neither she nor her brother were deficient in a reasonable severity,
but as this was scarce ever exerted without just cause, I was more

afflicted at their disapprobation than the punishment. Certainly the
method of treating youth would be altered if the distant effects, this
indiscriminate, and frequently indiscreet method produces, were
more conspicuous. I would willingly excuse myself from a further
explanation, did not the lesson this example conveys (which points
out an evil as frequent as it is pernicious) forbid my silence.
As Miss Lambercier felt a mother's affection, she sometimes
exerted a mother's authority, even to inflicting on us when we
deserved it, the punishment of infants. She had often threatened it,
and this threat of a treatment entirely new, appeared to me extremely
dreadful; but I found the reality much less terrible than the idea, and
what is still more unaccountable, this punishment increased my
affection for the person who had inflicted it. All this affection, aided
by my natural mildness, was scarcely sufficient to prevent my
seeking, by fresh offences, a return of the same chastisement; for a
degree of sensuality had mingled with the smart and shame, which
left more desire than fear of a repetition. I was well convinced the
same discipline from her brother would have produced a quite
contrary effect; but from a man of his disposition this was not
probable, and if I abstained from meriting correction it was merely
from a fear of offending Miss Lambercier, for benevolence, aided by
the passions, has ever maintained an empire over me which has
given law to my heart.
This event, which, though desirable, I had not endeavored to
accelerate, arrived without my fault; I should say, without my
seeking; and I profited by it with a safe conscience; but this second,
was also the last time, for Miss Lambercier, who doubtless had some
reason to imagine this chastisement did not produce the desired
effect, declared it was too fatiguing, and that she renounced it for the
future. Till now we had slept in her chamber, and during the winter,
even in her bed; but two days after another room was prepared for
us, and from that moment I had the honor (which I could very well
have dispensed with) of being treated by her as a great boy.
Who would believe this childish discipline, received at eight years
old, from the hands of a woman of thirty, should influence my
propensities, my desires, my passions, for the rest of my life, and
that in quite a contrary sense from what might naturally have been

expected? The very incident that inflamed my senses, gave my
desires such an extraordinary turn, that, confined to what I had
already experienced, I sought no further, and, with blood boiling with
sensuality, almost from my birth, preserved my purity beyond the age
when the coldest constitutions lose their insensibility; long
tormented, without knowing by what, I gazed on every handsome
woman with delight; imagination incessantly brought their charms to
my remembrance, only to transform them into so many Miss
Lamberciers.
If ever education was perfectly chaste, it was certainly that I
received; my three aunts were not only of exemplary prudence, but
maintained a degree of modest reserve which women have long
since thought unnecessary. My father, it is true, loved pleasure, but
his gallantry was rather of the last than the present century, and he
never expressed his affection for any woman he regarded in terms a
virgin could have blushed at; indeed, it was impossible more
attention should be paid to that regard we owe the morals of children
than was uniformly observed by every one I had any concern with.
An equal degree of reserve in this particular was observed at M.
Lambercier's, where a good maid-servant was discharged for having
once made use of an expression before us which was thought to
contain some degree of indelicacy. I had no precise idea of the
ultimate effect of the passions, but the conception I had formed was
extremely disgusting; I entertained a particular aversion for
courtesans, nor could I look on a rake without a degree of disdain
mingled with terror.
These prejudices of education, proper in themselves to retard the
first explosions of a combustible constitution, were strengthened, as I
have already hinted, by the effect the first moments of sensuality
produced in me, for notwithstanding the troublesome ebullition of my
blood, I was satisfied with the species of voluptuousness I had
already been acquainted with, and sought no further.
Thus I passed the age of puberty, with a constitution extremely
ardent, without knowing or even wishing for any other gratification of
the passions than what Miss Lambercier had innocently given me an
idea of; and when I became a man, that childish taste, instead of
vanishing, only associated with the other. This folly, joined to a

natural timidity, has always prevented my being very enterprising
with women, so that I have passed my days in languishing in silence
for those I most admired, without daring to disclose my wishes.
To fall at the feet of an imperious mistress, obey her mandates, or
implore pardon, were for me the most exquisite enjoyments, and the
more my blood was inflamed by the efforts of a lively imagination the
more I acquired the appearance of a whining lover.
It will be readily conceived that this mode of making love is not
attended with a rapid progress or imminent danger to the virtue of its
object; yet, though I have few favors to boast of, I have not been
excluded from enjoyment, however imaginary. Thus the senses, in
concurrence with a mind equally timid and romantic, have preserved
my moral chaste, and feelings uncorrupted, with precisely the same
inclinations, which, seconded with a moderate portion of effrontery,
might have plunged me into the most unwarrantable excesses.
I have made the first, most difficult step, in the obscure and painful
maze of my Confessions. We never feel so great a degree of
repugnance in divulging what is really criminal, as what is merely
ridiculous. I am now assured of my resolution, for after what I have
dared disclose, nothing can have power to deter me. The difficulty
attending these acknowledgments will be readily conceived, when I
declare, that during the whole of my life, though frequently laboring
under the most violent agitation, being hurried away with the
impetuosity of a passion which (when in company with those I loved)
deprived me of the faculty of sight and hearing, I could never, in the
course of the most unbounded familiarity, acquire sufficient
resolution to declare my folly, and implore the only favor that
remained to bestow.
In thus investigating the first traces of my sensible existence, I find
elements, which, though seemingly incompatible, have united to
produce a simple and uniform effect; while others, apparently the
same, have, by the concurrence of certain circumstances, formed
such different combinations, that it would never be imagined they
had any affinity; who would believe, for example, that one of the
most vigorous springs of my soul was tempered in the identical
source from whence luxury and ease mingled with my constitution

and circulated in my veins? Before I quit this subject, I will add a
striking instance of the different effects they produced.
One day, while I was studying in a chamber contiguous to the
kitchen, the maid set some of Miss Lambercier's combs to dry by the
fire, and on coming to fetch them some time after, was surprised to
find the teeth of one of them broken off. Who could be suspected of
this mischief? No one but myself had entered the room: I was
questioned, but denied having any knowledge of it. Mr. and Miss
Lambercier consult, exhort, threaten, but all to no purpose; I
obstinately persist in the denial; and, though this was the first time I
had been detected in a confirmed falsehood, appearances were so
strong that they overthrew all my protestations. This affair was
thought serious; the mischief, the lie, the obstinacy, were considered
equally deserving of punishment, which was not now to be
administered by Miss Lambercier. My uncle Bernard was written to;
he arrived; and my poor cousin being charged with a crime no less
serious, we were conducted to the same execution, which was
inflicted with great severity. If finding a remedy in the evil itself, they
had sought ever to allay my depraved desires, they could not have
chosen a shorter method to accomplish their designs, and, I can
assure my readers, I was for a long time freed from the dominion of
them.
As this severity could not draw from me the expected
acknowledgment, which obstinacy brought on several repetitions,
and reduced me to a deplorable situation, yet I was immovable, and
resolutely determined to suffer death rather than submit. Force, at
length, was obliged to yield to the diabolical infatuation of a child, for
no better name was bestowed on my constancy, and I came out of
this dreadful trial, torn, it is true, but triumphant. Fifty years have
expired since this adventure--the fear of punishment is no more.
Well, then, I aver, in the face of Heaven, I was absolutely innocent:
and, so far from breaking, or even touching the comb, never came
near the fire. It will be asked, how did this mischief happen? I can
form no conception of it, I only know my own innocence.
Let any one figure to himself a character whose leading traits were
docility and timidity, but haughty, ardent, and invincible, in its
passions; a child, hitherto governed by the voice of reason, treated

with mildness, equity, and complaisance, who could not even
support the idea of injustice, experiencing, for the first time, so
violent an instance of it, inflicted by those he most loved and
respected. What perversion of ideas! What confusion in the heart,
the brain, in all my little being, intelligent and moral!--let any one, I
say, if possible, imagine all this, for I am incapable of giving the least
idea of what passed in my mind at that period.
My reason was not sufficiently established to enable me to put
myself in the place of others, and judge how much appearances
condemned me, I only beheld the rigor of a dreadful chastisement,
inflicted for a crime I had not committed; yet I can truly affirm, the
smart I suffered, though violent, was inconsiderable compared to
what I felt from indignation, rage, and despair. My cousin, who was
almost in similar circumstances, having been punished for an
involuntary fault as guilty of a premediated crime, became furious by
my example. Both in the same bed, we embraced each other with
convulsive transport; we were almost suffocated; and when our
young hearts found sufficient relief to breathe out our indigination,
we sat up in the bed, and with all our force, repeated a hundred
times, Carnifex! Carnifex! Carnifex! executioner, tormentor.
Even while I write this I feel my pulse quicken, and should I live a
hundred thousand years, the agitation of that moment would still be
fresh in my memory. The first instance of violence and oppression is
so deeply engraved on my soul, that every relative idea renews my
emotion: the sentiment of indignation, which in its origin had
reference only to myself, has acquired such strength, and is at
present so completely detached from personal motives, that my
heart is as much inflamed at the sight or relation of any act of
injustice (whatever may be the object, or wheresoever it may be
perpetrated) as if I was the immediate sufferer. When I read the
history of a merciless tyrant, or the dark and the subtle machination
of a knavish designing priest, I could on the instant set off to stab the
miscreants, though I was certain to perish in the attempt.
I have frequently fatigued myself by running after and stoning a
cock, a cow, a dog, or any animal I saw tormenting another, only
because it was conscious of possessing superior strength. This may
be natural to me, and I am inclined to believe it is, though the lively

impression of the first injustice I became the victim of was too long
and too powerfully remembered not to have added considerable
force to it.
This occurrence terminated my infantine serenity; from that
moment I ceased to enjoy a pure unadulterated happiness, and on a
retrospection of the pleasure of my childhood, I yet feel they ended
here. We continue at Bossey some months after this event, but were
like our first parents in the Garden of Eden after they had lost their
innocence; in appearance our situation was the same, in effect it was
totally different.
Affection, respect; intimacy, confidence, no longer attached the
pupils to their guides; we beheld them no longer as divinities, who
could read the secrets of our hearts; we were less ashamed of
committing faults, more afraid of being accused of them: we learned
to dissemble, to rebel, to lie: all the vices common to our years
began to corrupt our happy innocence, mingle with our sports, and
embitter our amusements. The country itself, losing those sweet and
simple charms which captivate the heart, appeared a gloomy desert,
or covered with a veil that concealed its beauties. We cultivated our
little gardens no more: our flowers were neglected. We no longer
scratched away the mould, and broke out into exclamations of
delight, on discovering that the grain we had sown began to shoot.
We were disgusted with our situation; our preceptors were weary of
us. In a word, my uncle wrote for our return, and we left Mr. and Miss
Lambercier without feeling any regret at the separation.
Near thirty years passed away from my leaving Bossey, without
once recalling the place to my mind with any degree of satisfaction;
but after having passed the prime of life, as I decline into old age
(while more recent occurrences are wearing out apace) I feel these
remembrances revive and imprint themselves on my heart, with a
force and charm that every day acquires fresh strength; as if, feeling
life fleet from me, I endeavored to catch it again by its
commencement. The most trifling incident of those happy days
delight me, for no other reason than being of those days. I recall
every circumstance of time, place, and persons; I see the maid or
footman busy in the chamber, a swallow entering the window, a fly
settling on my hand while repeating my lessons. I see the whole

economy of the apartment; on the right hand Mr. Lambercier's closet,
with a print representing all the popes, a barometer, a large almanac,
the windows of the house (which stood in a hollow at the bottom of
the garden) shaded by raspberry shrubs, whose shoots sometimes
found entrance; I am sensible the reader has no occasion to know all
this, but I feel a kind of necessity for relating it. Why am I not
permitted to recount all the little anecdotes of that thrice happy age,
at the recollection of whose joys I ever tremble with delight? Five or
six particularly--let us compromise the matter--I will give up five, but
then I must have one, and only one, provided I may draw it out to its
utmost length, in order to prolong my satisfaction.
If I only sought yours, I should choose that of Miss Lambercier's
backside, which by an unlucky fall at the bottom of the meadow, was
exposed to the view of the King of Sardinia, who happened to be
passing by; but that of the walnut tree on the terrace is more
amusing to me, since here I was an actor, whereas, in the
abovementioned scene I was only a spectator; and I must confess I
see nothing that should occasion risibility in an accident, which,
however laughable in itself, alarmed me for a person I loved as a
mother, or perhaps something more.
Ye curious readers, whose expectations are already on the stretch
for the noble history of the terrace, listen to the tragedy, and abstain
from trembling, if you can, at the horrible catastrophe!
At the outside of the courtyard door, on the left hand, was a
terrace; here they often sat after dinner; but it was subject to one
inconvenience, being too much exposed to the rays of the sun; to
obviate this defect, Mr. Lambercier had a walnut tree set there, the
planting of which was attended with great solemnity. The two
boarders were godfathers, and while the earth was replacing round
the root, each held the tree with one hand, singing songs of triumph.
In order to water it with more effect, they formed a kind of luson
around its foot: myself and cousin, who were every day ardent
spectators of this watering, confirmed each other in the very natural
idea that it was nobler to plant trees on the terrace than colors on a
breach, and this glory we were resolved to procure without dividing it
with any one.

In pursuance of this resolution, we cut a slip off a willow, and
planted it on the terrace, at about eight or ten feet distance from the
august walnut tree. We did not forget to make a hollow round it, but
the difficulty was how to procure a supply of water, which was
brought from a considerable distance, and we not permitted to fetch
it: but water was absolutely necessary for our willow, and we made
use of every stratagem to obtain it.
For a few days everything succeeded so well that it began to bud,
and throw out small leaves, which we hourly measured convinced
(tho' now scarce a foot from the ground) it would soon afford us a
refreshing shade. This unfortunate willow, by engrossing our whole
time, rendered us incapable of application to any other study, and
the cause of our inattention not being known, we were kept closer
than before. The fatal moment approached when water must fail,
and we were already afflicted with the idea that our tree must perish
with drought. At length necessity, the parent of industry, suggested
an invention, by which we might save our tree from death, and
ourselves from despair; it was to make a furrow underground, which
would privately conduct a part of the water from the walnut tree to
our willow. This undertaking was executed with ardor, but did not
immediately succeed--our descent was not skilfully planned--the
water did not run, the earth falling in and stopping up the furrow; yet,
though all went contrary, nothing discouraged us, 'omnia vincit labor
improbus'. We made the bason deeper, to give the water a more
sensible descent; we cut the bottom of a box into narrow planks;
increased the channel from the walnut tree to our willow and laying a
row flat at the bottom, set two others inclining towards each other, so
as to form a triangular channel; we formed a kind of grating with
small sticks at the end next the walnut tree, to prevent the earth and
stones from stopping it up, and having carefully covered our work
with well--trodden earth, in a transport of hope and fear attended the
hour of watering. After an interval, which seemed an age of
expectation, this hour arrived. Mr. Lambercier, as usual, assisted at
the operation; we contrived to get between him and our tree, towards
which he fortunately turned his back. They no sooner began to pour
the first pail of water, than we perceived it running to the willow; this
sight was too much for our prudence, and we involuntarily expressed

our transport by a shout of joy. The sudden exclamation made Mr.
Lambercier turn about, though at that instant he was delighted to
observe how greedily the earth, which surrounded the root of his
walnut tree, imbibed the water. Surprised at seeing two trenches
partake of it, he shouted in his turn, examines, perceives the
roguery, and, sending instantly for a pick axe, at one fatal blow
makes two or three of our planks fly, crying out meantime with all his
strength, an aqueduct! an aqueduct! His strokes redoubled, every
one of which made an impression on our hearts; in a moment the
planks, the channel, the bason, even our favorite willow, all were
ploughed up, nor was one word pronounced during this terrible
transaction, except the above mentioned exclamation. An aqueduct!
repeated he, while destroying all our hopes, an aqueduct! an
aqueduct!
It maybe supposed this adventure had a still more melancholy end
for the young architects; this, however, was not the case; the affair
ended here. Mr. Lambercier never reproached us on this account,
nor was his countenance clouded with a frown; we even heard him
mention the circumstance to his sister with loud bursts of laughter.
The laugh of Mr. Lambercier might be heard to a considerable
distance. But what is still more surprising after the first transport of
sorrow had subsided, we did not find ourselves violently afflicted; we
planted a tree in another spot, and frequently recollected the
catastrophe of the former, repeating with a significant emphasis, an
aqueduct! an aqueduct! Till then, at intervals, I had fits of ambition,
and could fancy myself Brutus or Aristides, but this was the first
visible effect of my vanity. To have constructed an aqueduct with our
own hands, to have set a slip of willow in competition with a
flourishing tree, appeared to me a supreme degree of glory! I had a
juster conception of it at ten than Caesar entertained at thirty.
The idea of this walnut tree, with the little anecdotes it gave rise to,
have so well continued, or returned to my memory, that the design
which conveyed the most pleasing sensations, during my journey to
Geneva, in the year
, was visiting Bossey, and reviewing the
monuments of my infantine amusement, above all, the beloved
walnut tree, whose age at that time must have been verging on a
third of a century, but I was so beset with company that I could not

find a moment to accomplish my design. There is little appearance
now of the occasion being renewed; but should I ever return to that
charming spot, and find my favorite walnut tree still existing, I am
convinced I should water it with my tears.
On my return to Geneva, I passed two or three years at my
uncle's, expecting the determination of my friends respecting my
future establishment. His own son being devoted to genius, was
taught drawing, and instructed by his father in the elements of
Euclid; I partook of these instructions, but was principally fond of
drawing. Meantime, they were irresolute, whether to make me a
watchmaker, a lawyer, or a minister. I should have preferred being a
minister, as I thought it must be a charming thing to preach, but the
trifling income which had been my mother's, and was to be divided
between my brother and myself, was too inconsiderable to defray the
expense attending the prosecution of my studies. As my age did not
render the choice very pressing, I remained with my uncle, passing
my time with very little improvement, and paying pretty dear, though
not unreasonably, for my board.
My uncle, like my father, was a man of pleasure, but had not
learned, like him, to abridge his amusements for the sake of
instructing his family, consequently our education was neglected. My
aunt was a devotee, who loved singing psalms better than thinking of
our improvement, so that we were left entirely to ourselves, which
liberty we never abused.
Ever inseparable, we were all the world to each other; and, feeling
no inclination to frequent the company of a number of disorderly lads
of our own age, we learned none of those habits of libertinism to
which our idle life exposed us. Perhaps I am wrong in charging
myself and cousin with idleness at this time, for, in our lives, we were
never less so; and what was extremely fortunate, so incessantly
occupied with our amusements, that we found no temptation to
spend any part of our time in the streets. We made cages, pipes,
kites, drums, houses, ships, and bows; spoiled the tools of my good
old grandfather by endeavoring to make watches in imitation of him;
but our favorite amusement was wasting paper, in drawing, washing,
coloring, etc. There came an Italian mountebank to Geneva, called
Gamber-Corta, who had an exhibition of puppets, that he made play

a kind of comedy. We went once to see them, but could not spare
time to go again, being busily employed in making puppets of our
own and inventing comedies, which we immediately set about
making them perform, mimicking to the best of our abilities the
uncouth voice of Punch; and, to complete the business, my good
aunt and uncle Bernard had the patience to see and listen to our
imitations; but my uncle, having one day read an elaborate discourse
to his family, we instantly gave up our comedies, and began
composing sermons.
These details, I confess, are not very amusing, but they serve to
demonstrate that the former part of our education was well directed,
since being, at such an early age, the absolute masters of our time,
we found no inclination to abuse it; and so little in want of other
companions, that we constantly neglected every occasion of seeking
them. When taking our walks together, we observed their diversions
without feeling any inclination to partake of them. Friendship so
entirely occupied our hearts, that, pleased with each other's
company the simplest pastimes were sufficient to delight us.
We were soon remarked for being thus inseparable: and what
rendered us more conspicuous, my cousin was very tall, myself
extremely short, so that we exhibited a very whimsical contrast. This
meagre figure, small, sallow countenance, heavy air, and supine
gait, excited the ridicule of the children, who, in the gibberish of the
country, nicknamed him 'Barna Bredanna'; and we no sooner got out
of doors than our ears were assailed with a repetition of "Barna
Bredanna." He bore this indignity with tolerable patience, but I was
instantly for fighting. This was what the young rogues aimed at. I
engaged accordingly, and was beat. My poor cousin did all in his
power to assist me, but he was weak, and a single stroke brought
him to the ground. I then became furious, and received several smart
blows, some of which were aimed at 'Barna Bredanna'. This quarrel
so far increased the evil, that, to avoid their insults, we could only
show ourselves in the streets while they were employed at school.
I had already become a redresser of grievances; there only
wanted a lady in the way to be a knight-errant in form. This defect
was soon supplied; I presently had two. I frequently went to see my
father at Nion, a small city in the Vaudois country, where he was now

settled. Being universally respected, the affection entertained for him
extended to me: and, during my visits, the question seemed to be,
who should show me most kindness. A Madame de Vulson, in
particular, loaded me with caresses; and, to complete all, her
daughter made me her gallant. I need not explain what kind of
gallant a boy of eleven must be to a girl of two and twenty; the artful
hussies know how to set these puppets up in front, to conceal more
serious engagements. On my part I saw no inequality between
myself and Miss Vulson, was flattered by the circumstance, and went
into it with my whole heart, or rather my whole head, for this passion
certainly reached no further, though it transported me almost to
madness, and frequently produced scenes sufficient to make even a
cynic expire with laughter.
I have experienced two kinds of love, equally real, which have
scarce any affinity, yet each differing materially from tender
friendship. My whole life has been divided between these affections,
and I have frequently felt the power of both at the same instant. For
example, at the very time I so publically and tyrannically claimed
Miss Vulson, that I could not suffer any other of my sex to approach
her, I had short, but passionate, assignations with a Miss Goton, who
thought proper to act the schoolmistress with me. Our meetings,
though absolutely childish, afforded me the height of happiness. I felt
the whole charm of mystery, and repaid Miss Vulson in kind, when
she least expected it, the use she made of me in concealing her
amours. To my great mortification, this secret was soon discovered,
and I presently lost my young schoolmistress.
Miss Goton was, in fact, a singular personage. She was not
handsome, yet there was a certain something in her figure which
could not easily be forgotten, and this for an old fool, I am too often
convinced of. Her eyes, in particular, neither corresponded with her
age, her height, nor her manner; she had a lofty imposing air, which
agreed extremely well with the character she assumed, but the most
extraordinary part of her composition was a mixture of forwardness
and reserve difficult to be conceived; and while she took the greatest
liberties with me, would never permit any to be taken with her in
return, treating me precisely like a child. This makes me suppose

she had either ceased herself to be one, or was yet sufficiently so to
behold us play the danger to which this folly exposed her.
I was so absolutely in the power of both these mistresses, that
when in the presence of either, I never thought of her who was
absent; in other respects, the effects they produced on me bore no
affinity. I could have passed my whole life with Miss Vulson, without
forming a wish to quit her; but then, my satisfaction was attended
with a pleasing serenity; and, in numerous companies, I was
particularly charmed with her. The sprightly sallies of her wit, the
arch glance of her eye, even jealousy itself, strengthened my
attachment, and I triumphed in the preference she seemed to bestow
on me, while addressed by more powerful rivals; applause,
encouragement, and smiles, gave animation to my happiness.
Surrounded by a throng of observers, I felt the whole force of love--I
was passionate, transported; in a tete-a-tete, I should have been
constrained, thoughtful, perhaps unhappy. If Miss Vulson was ill, I
suffered with her; would willingly have given up my own health to
establish hers (and, observe I knew the want of it from experience); if
absent, she employed my thoughts, I felt the want of her; when
present, her caresses came with warmth and rapture to my heart,
though my senses were unaffected. The familiarities she bestowed
on me I could not have supported the idea of her granting to another;
I loved her with a brother's affection only, but experienced all the
jealousy of a lover.
With Miss Goton this passion might have acquired a degree of
fury; I should have been a Turk, a tiger, had I once imagined she
bestowed her favors on any but myself. The pleasure I felt on
approaching Miss Vulson was sufficiently ardent, though unattended
with uneasy sensations; but at sight of Miss Goton, I felt myself
bewildered--every sense was absorbed in ecstasy. I believe it would
have been impossible to have remained long with her; I must have
been suffocated with the violence of my palpitations. I equally
dreaded giving either of them displeasure; with one I was more
complaisant; with the other, more submissive. I would not have
offended Miss Vulson for the world; but if Miss Goton had
commanded me to throw myself into the flames, I think I should have
instantly obeyed her. Happily, both for her and myself, our amours;

or rather rendezvous, were not of long duration: and though my
connection with Miss Vulson was less dangerous, after a
continuance of some greater length, that likewise had its
catastrophe; indeed the termination of a love affair is good for
nothing, unless it partakes of the romantic, and can furnish out at
least an exclamation.
Though my correspondence with Miss Vulson was less animated,
it was perhaps more endearing; we never separated without tears,
and it can hardly be conceived what a void I felt in my heart. I could
neither think nor speak of anything but her. These romantic sorrows
were not affected, though I am inclined to believe they did not
absolutely centre in her, for I am persuaded (though I did not
perceive it at that time) being deprived of amusement bore a
considerable share in them.
To soften the rigor of absence, we agreed to correspond with each
other, and the pathetic expressions these letters contained were
sufficient to have split a rock. In a word, I had the honor of her not
being able to endure the pain of separation. She came to see me at
Geneva.
My head was now completely turned; and during the two days she
remained here, I was intoxicated with delight. At her departure, I
would have thrown myself into the water after her, and absolutely
rent the air with my cries. The week following she sent me
sweetmeats, gloves, etc. This certainly would have appeared
extremely gallant, had I not been informed of her marriage at the
same instant, and that the journey I had thought proper to give
myself the honor of, was only to buy her wedding suit.
My indignation may easily be conceived; I shall not attempt to
describe it. In this heroic fury, I swore never more to see the
perfidious girl, supposing it the greatest punishment that could be
inflicted on her. This, however, did not occasion her death, for twenty
years after, while on a visit to my father, being on the lake, I asked
who those ladies were in a boat not far from ours. "What!" said my
father smiling, "does not your heart inform you? It is your former
flame, it is Madame Christin, or, if you please, Miss Vulson." I started
at the almost forgotten name, and instantly ordered the waterman to
turn off, not judging it worth while to be perjured, however favorable

the opportunity for revenge, in renewing a dispute of twenty years
past, with a woman of forty.
Thus, before my future destination was determined, did I fool away
the most precious moments of my youth. After deliberating a long
time on the bent of my natural inclination, they resolved to dispose of
me in a manner the most repugnant to them. I was sent to Mr.
Masseron, the City Register, to learn (according to the expression of
my uncle Bernard) the thriving occupation of a scraper. This
nickname was inconceivably displeasing to me, and I promised
myself but little satisfaction in the prospect of heaping up money by a
mean employment. The assiduity and subjection required, completed
my disgust, and I never set foot in the office without feeling a kind of
horror, which every day gained fresh strength.
Mr. Masseron, who was not better pleased with my abilities than I
was with the employment, treated me with disdain, incessantly
upbraiding me with being a fool and blockhead, not forgetting to
repeat, that my uncle had assured him I was a knowing one, though
he could not find that I knew anything. That he had promised to
furnish him with a sprightly boy, but had, in truth, sent him an ass. To
conclude, I was turned out of the registry, with the additional
ignominy of being pronounced a fool by all Mr. Masseron's clerks,
and fit only to handle a file.
My vocation thus determined, I was bound apprentice; not,
however, to a watchmaker, but to an engraver, and I had been so
completely humiliated by the contempt of the register, that I
submitted without a murmur. My master, whose name was M.
Ducommon, was a young man of a very violent and boorish
character, who contrived in a short time to tarnish all the amiable
qualities of my childhood, to stupefy a disposition naturally sprightly,
and reduce my feelings, as well as my condition, to an absolute state
of servitude. I forgot my Latin, history, and antiquities; I could hardly
recollect whether such people as Romans ever existed. When I
visited my father, he no longer beheld his idol, nor could the ladies
recognize the gallant Jean Jacques; nay, I was so well convinced
that Mr. and Miss Lambercier would scarce receive me as their pupil,
that I endeavored to avoid their company, and from that time have
never seen them. The vilest inclinations, the basest actions,

succeeded my amiable amusements and even obliterated the very
remembrance of them. I must have had, in spite of my good
education, a great propensity to degenerate, else the declension
could not have followed with such ease and rapidity, for never did so
promising a Caesar so quickly become a Laradon.
The art itself did not displease me. I had a lively taste for drawing.
There was nothing displeasing in the exercise of the graver; and as it
required no very extraordinary abilities to attain perfection as a
watchcase engraver, I hoped to arrive at it. Perhaps I should have
accomplished my design, if unreasonable restraint, added to the
brutality of my master, had not rendered my business disgusting. I
wasted his time, and employed myself in engraving medals, which
served me and my companions as a kind of insignia for a new
invented order of chivalry, and though this differed very little from my
usual employ, I considered it as a relaxation. Unfortunately, my
master caught me at this contraband labor, and a severe beating
was the consequence. He reproached me at the same time with
attempting to make counterfeit money because our medals bore the
arms of the Republic, though, I can truly aver, I had no conception of
false money, and very little of the true, knowing better how to make a
Roman As than one of our threepenny pieces.
My master's tyranny rendered insupportable that labor I should
otherwise have loved, and drove me to vices I naturally despised,
such as falsehood, idleness, and theft. Nothing ever gave me a
clearer demonstration of the difference between filial dependence
and abject slavery, than the remembrance of the change produced in
me at that period. Hitherto I had enjoyed a reasonable liberty; this I
had suddenly lost. I was enterprising at my father's, free at Mr.
Lambercier's, discreet at my uncle's; but, with my master, I became
fearful, and from that moment my mind was vitiated. Accustomed to
live on terms of perfect equality, to be witness of no pleasures I could
not command, to see no dish I was not to partake of, or be sensible
of a desire I might not express; to be able to bring every wish of my
heart to my lips--what a transition!--at my master's I was scarce
allowed to speak, was forced to quit the table without tasting what I
most longed for, and the room when I had nothing particular to do
there; was incessantly confined to my work, while the liberty my

master and his journeymen enjoyed, served only to increase the
weight of my subjection. When disputes happened to arise, though
conscious that I understood the subject better than any of them, I
dared not offer my opinion; in a word, everything I saw became an
object of desire, for no other reason than because I was not
permitted to enjoy anything. Farewell gayety, ease, those happy
turns of expressions, which formerly even made my faults escape
correction. I recollect, with pleasure, a circumstance that happened
at my father's, which even now makes me smile. Being for some
fault ordered to bed without my supper, as I was passing through the
kitchen, with my poor morsel of bread in my hand, I saw the meat
turning on the spit; my father and the rest were round the fire; I must
bow to every one as I passed. When I had gone through this
ceremony, leering with a wistful eye at the roast meat, which looked
so inviting, and smelt so savory, I could not abstain from making that
a bow likewise, adding in a pitiful tone, good bye, roast meal! This
unpremeditated pleasantry put them in such good humor, that I was
permitted to stay, and partake of it. Perhaps the same thing might
have produced a similar effect at my master's, but such a thought
could never have occurred to me, or, if it had, I should not have had
courage to express it.
Thus I learned to covet, dissemble, lie, and, at length, to steal, a
propensity I never felt the least idea of before, though since that time
I have never been able entirely to divest myself of it. Desire and
inability united naturally led to this vice, which is the reason pilfering
is so common among footmen and apprentices, though the latter, as
they grow up, and find themselves in a situation where everything is
at their command, lose this shameful propensity. As I never
experienced the advantage, I never enjoyed the benefit.
Good sentiments, ill-directed, frequently lead children into vice.
Notwithstanding my continual wants and temptations, it was more
than a year before I could resolve to take even eatables. My first
theft was occasioned by complaisance, but it was productive of
others which had not so plausible an excuse.
My master had a journeyman named Verrat, whose mother lived in
the neighborhood, and had a garden at a considerable distance from
the house, which produced excellent asparagus. This Verrat, who

had no great plenty of money, took it in his head to rob her of the
most early production of her garden, and by the sale of it procure
those indulgences he could not otherwise afford himself; but not
being very nimble, he did not care to run the hazard of a surprise.
After some preliminary flattery, which I did not comprehend the
meaning of, he proposed this expedition to me, as an idea which had
that moment struck him. At first I would not listen to the proposal; but
he persisted in his solicitation, and as I could never resist the attacks
of flattery, at length prevailed. In pursuance of this virtuous
resolution, I every morning repaired to the garden, gathered the best
of the asparagus, and took it to the Holard where some good old
women, who guessed how I came by it, wishing to diminish the price,
made no secret of their suspicions; this produced the desired effect,
for, being alarmed, I took whatever they offered, which being taken
to Mr. Verrat, was presently metamorphosed into a breakfast, and
divided with a companion of his; for, though I procured it, I never
partook of their good cheer, being fully satisfied with an
inconsiderable bribe.
I executed my roguery with the greatest fidelity, seeking only to
please my employer; and several days passed before it came into
my head, to rob the robber, and tithe Mr. Verrat's harvest. I never
considered the hazard I run in these expeditions, not only of a torrent
of abuse, but what I should have been still more sensible of, a hearty
beating; for the miscreant, who received the whole benefit, would
certainly have denied all knowledge of the fact, and I should only
have received a double portion of punishment for daring to accuse
him, since being only an apprentice, I stood no chance of being
believed in opposition to a journeyman. Thus, in every situation,
powerful rogues know how to save themselves at the expense of the
feeble.
This practice taught me it was not so terrible to thieve as I had
imagined: I took care to make this discovery turn to some account,
helping myself to everything within my reach, that I conceived an
inclination for. I was not absolutely ill-fed at my master's, and
temperance was only painful to me by comparing it with the luxury
he enjoyed. The custom of sending young people from table
precisely when those things are served up which seem most

tempting, is calculated to increase their longing, and induces them to
steal what they conceive to be so delicious. It may be supposed I
was not backward in this particular: in general my knavery
succeeded pretty well, though quite the reverse when I happened to
be detected.
I recollect an attempt to procure some apples, which was attended
with circumstances that make me smile and shudder even at this
instant. The fruit was standing in the pantry, which by a lattice at a
considerable height received light from the kitchen. One day, being
alone in the house, I climbed up to see these precious apples, which
being out of my reach, made this pantry appear the garden of
Hesperides. I fetched the spit--tried if it would reach them--it was too
short--I lengthened it with a small one which was used for game,--my
master being very fond of hunting, darted at them several times
without success; at length was more fortunate; being transported to
find I was bringing up an apple, I drew it gently to the lattice--was
going to seize it when (who can express my grief and astonishment!)
I found it would not pass through--it was too large. I tried every
expedient to accomplish my design, sought supporters to keep the
spits in the same position, a knife to divide the apple, and a lath to
hold it with; at length, I so far succeeded as to effect the division, and
made no doubt of drawing the pieces through; but it was scarcely
separated, (compassionate reader, sympathize with my affliction)
when both pieces fell into the pantry.

Though I lost time by this experiment, I did not lose courage, but,
dreading a surprise, I put off the attempt till next day, when I hoped
to be more successful, and returned to my work as if nothing had
happened, without once thinking of what the two obvious witnesses I
had left in the pantry deposed against me.
The next day (a fine opportunity offering) I renew the trial. I fasten
the spits together; get on the stool; take aim; am just going to dart at
my prey--unfortunately the dragon did not sleep; the pantry door
opens, my master makes his appearance, and, looking up, exclaims,

"Bravo!" --The horror of that moment returns--the pen drops from my
hand.
A continual repetition of ill treatment rendered me callous; it
seemed a kind of composition for my crimes, which authorized me to
continue them, and, instead of looking back at the punishment, I
looked forward to revenge. Being beat like a slave, I judged I had a
right to all the vices of one. I was convinced that to rob and be
punished were inseparable, and constituted, if I may so express
myself, a kind of traffic, in which, if I perform my part of the bargain,
my master would take care not to be deficient in his; that preliminary
settled, I applied myself to thieving with great tranquility, and
whenever this interrogatory occurred to my mind, "What will be the
consequence?" the reply was ready, "I know the worst, I shall be
beat; no matter, I was made for it."
I love good eating; am sensual, but not greedy; I have such a
variety of inclinations to gratify, that this can never predominate; and
unless my heart is unoccupied, which very rarely happens, I pay but
little attention to my appetite; to purloining eatables, but extended
this propensity to everything I wished to possess, and if I did not
become a robber in form, it was only because money never tempted
me.
My master had a closet in the workshop, which he kept locked;
this I contrived to open and shut as often as I pleased, and laid his
best tools, fine drawings, impressions, in a word, everything he
wished to keep from me, under contribution.
These thefts were so far innocent, that they were always
employed in his service, but I was transported at having the trifles in
my possession, and imagined I stole the art with its productions.
Besides what I have mentioned, his boxes contained threads of gold
and silver, a number of small jewels, valuable medals, and money;
yet, though I seldom had five sous in my pocket, I do not recollect
ever having cast a wishful look at them; on the contrary, I beheld
these valuables rather with terror than with delight.
I am convinced the dread of taking money was, in a great
measure, the effect of education. There was mingled with the idea of
it the fear of infamy, a prison, punishment, and death: had I even felt
the temptation, these objects would have made me tremble; whereas

my failings appeared a species of waggery, and, in truth, they were
little else; they could but occasion a good trimming, and this I was
already prepared for. A sheet of fine drawing paper was a greater
temptation than money sufficient to have purchased a ream. This
unreasonable caprice is connected with one of the most striking
singularities of my character, and has so far influenced my conduct,
that it requires a particular explanation.
My passions are extremely violent; while under their influence,
nothing can equal my impetuosity; I am an absolute stranger to
discretion, respect, fear, or decorum; rude, saucy, violent, and
intrepid: no shame can stop, no danger intimidate me. My mind is
frequently so engrossed by a single object, that beyond it the whole
world is not worth a thought; this is the enthusiasm of a moment, the
next, perhaps, I am plunged in a state of annihilation. Take me in my
moments of tranquility, I am indolence and timidity itself; a word to
speak, the least trifle to perform, appear an intolerable labor;
everything alarms and terrifies me; the very buzzing of a fly will make
me shudder; I am so subdued by fear and shame, that I would gladly
shield myself from mortal view.
When obliged to exert myself, I am ignorant what to do! when
forced to speak, I am at a loss for words; and if any one looks at me,
I am instantly out of countenance. If animated with my subject, I
express my thoughts with ease, but, in ordinary conversations, I can
say nothing --absolutely nothing; and, being obliged to speak,
renders them insupportable.
I may add, that none of my predominant inclinations centre in
those pleasures which are to be purchased: money empoisons my
delight; I must have them unadulterated; I love those of the table, for
instance, but cannot endure the restraints of good company, or the
intemperance of taverns; I can enjoy them only with a friend, for
alone it is equally impossible; my imagination is then so occupied
with other things, that I find no pleasure in eating. Women who are to
be purchased have no charms for me; my beating heart cannot be
satisfied without affection; it is the same with every other enjoyment,
if not truly disinterested, they are absolutely insipid; in a word, I am
fond of those things which are only estimable to minds formed for the
peculiar enjoyment of them.

I never thought money so desirable as it is usually imagined; if you
would enjoy you must transform it; and this transformation is
frequently attended with inconvenience; you must bargain, purchase,
pay dear, be badly served, and often duped. I buy an egg, am
assured it is new-laid --I find it stale; fruit in its utmost perfection--'tis
absolutely green. I love good wine, but where shall I get it? Not at my
wine merchant's --he will poison me to a certainty. I wish to be
universally respected; how shall I compass my design? I must make
friends, send messages, write letters, come, go, wait, and be
frequently deceived. Money is the perpetual source of uneasiness; I
fear it more than I love good wine.
A thousand times, both during and since my apprenticeship, have I
gone out to purchase some nicety, I approach the pastry-cook's,
perceive some women at the counter, and imagine they are laughing
at me. I pass a fruit shop, see some fine pears, their appearance
tempts me; but then two or three young people are near, or a man I
am acquainted with is standing at the door; I take all that pass for
persons I have some knowledge of, and my near sight contributes to
deceive me. I am everywhere intimidated, restrained by some
obstacle, and with money in my pocket return as I went, for want of
resolution to purchase what I long for.
I should enter into the most insipid details was I to relate the
trouble, shame, repugnance, and inconvenience of all kinds which I
have experienced in parting with my money, whether in my own
person, or by the agency of others; as I proceed, the reader will get
acquainted with my disposition, and perceive all this without my
troubling him with the recital.
This once comprehended, one of my apparent contradictions will
be easily accounted for, and the most sordid avarice reconciled with
the greatest contempt of money. It is a movable which I consider of
so little value, that, when destitute of it, I never wish to acquire any;
and when I have a sum I keep it by me, for want of knowing how to
dispose of it to my satisfaction; but let an agreeable and convenient
opportunity present itself, and I empty my purse with the utmost
freedom; not that I would have the reader imagine I am extravagant
from a motive of ostentation, quite the reverse; it was ever in
subservience to my pleasures, and, instead of glorying in expense, I

endeavor to conceal it. I so well perceive that money is not made to
answer my purposes, that I am almost ashamed to have any, and,
still more, to make use of it.
Had I ever possessed a moderate independence, I am convinced I
should have had no propensity to become avaricious. I should have
required no more, and cheerfully lived up to my income; but my
precarious situation has constantly and necessarily kept me in fear. I
love liberty, and I loathe constraint, dependence, and all their kindred
annoyances. As long as my purse contains money it secures my
independence, and exempts me from the trouble of seeking other
money, a trouble of which I have always had a perfect horror; and
the dread of seeing the end of my independence, makes me
proportionately unwilling to part with my money. The money that we
possess is the instrument of liberty, that which we lack and strive to
obtain is the instrument of slavery. Thence it is that I hold fast to
aught that I have, and yet covet nothing more.
My disinterestedness, then, is in reality only idleness, the pleasure
of possessing is not in my estimation worth the trouble of acquiring:
and my dissipation is only another form of idleness; when we have
an opportunity of disbursing pleasantly we should make the best
possible use of it.
I am less tempted by money than by other objects, because
between the moment of possessing the money and that of using it to
obtain the desired object there is always an interval, however short;
whereas to possess the thing is to enjoy it. I see a thing and it tempts
me; but if I see not the thing itself but only the means of acquiring it, I
am not tempted. Therefore it is that I have been a pilferer, and am so
even now, in the way of mere trifles to which I take a fancy, and
which I find it easier to take than to ask for; but I never in my life
recollect having taken a farthing from any one, except about fifteen
years ago, when I stole seven francs and ten sous. The story is
worth recounting, as it exhibits a concurrence of ignorance and
stupidity I should scarcely credit, did it relate to any but myself.
It was in Paris: I was walking with M. de Franceul at the Palais
Royal; he pulled out his watch, he looked at it, and said to me,
"Suppose we go to the opera?"--"With all my heart." We go: he takes
two box tickets, gives me one, and enters himself with the other; I

follow, find the door crowded; and, looking in, see every one
standing; judging, therefore, that M. de Franceul might suppose me
concealed by the company, I go out, ask for my ticket, and, getting
the money returned, leave the house, without considering, that by
then I had reached the door every one would be seated, and M. de
Franceul might readily perceive I was not there.
As nothing could be more opposite to my natural inclination than
this abominable meanness, I note it, to show there are moments of
delirium when men ought not to be judged by their actions: this was
not stealing the money, it was only stealing the use of it, and was the
more infamous for wanting the excuse of a temptation.
I should never end these accounts, was I to describe all the
gradations through which I passed, during my apprenticeship, from
the sublimity of a hero to the baseness of a villain. Though I entered
into most of the vices of my situation, I had no relish for its
pleasures; the amusements of my companions were displeasing,
and when too much restraint had made my business wearisome, I
had nothing to amuse me. This renewed my taste for reading which
had long been neglected. I thus committed a fresh offence, books
made me neglect my work, and brought on additional punishment,
while inclination, strengthened by constraint, became an
unconquerable passion. La Tribu, a well-known librarian, furnished
me with all kinds; good or bad, I perused them with avidity, and
without discrimination.
It will be said; "at length, then, money became necessary"--true;
but this happened at a time when a taste for study had deprived me
both of resolution and activity; totally occupied by this new
inclination, I only wished to read, I robbed no longer. This is another
of my peculiarities; a mere nothing frequently calls me off from what I
appear the most attached to; I give in to the new idea; it becomes a
passion, and immediately every former desire is forgotten.
Reading was my new hobby; my heart beat with impatience to run
over the new book I carried in my pocket; the first moment I was
alone, I seized the opportunity to draw it out, and thought no longer
of rummaging my master's closet. I was even ashamed to think that I
had been guilty of such meanness; and had my amusements been
more expensive, I no longer felt an inclination to continue it. La Tribu

gave me credit, and when once I had the book in my possession, I
thought no more of the trifle I was to pay for it; as money came it
naturally passed to this woman; and when she chanced to be
pressing, nothing was so conveniently at hand as my own effects; to
steal in advance required foresight, and robbing to pay was no
temptation.
The frequent blows I received from my master, with my private and
ill-chosen studies, rendered me reserved, unsociable, and almost
deranged my reason. Though my taste had not preserved me from
silly unmeaning books, by good fortune I was a stranger to licentious
or obscene ones; not that La Tribu (who was very accommodating)
had any scruple of lending these, on the contrary, to enhance their
worth she spoke of them with an air of mystery; this produced an
effect she had not foreseen, for both shame and disgust made me
constantly refuse them. Chance so well seconded my bashful
disposition, that I was past the age of thirty before I saw any of those
dangerous compositions.
In less than a year I had exhausted La Tribu's scanty library, and
was unhappy for want of further amusement. My reading, though
frequently bad, had worn off my childish follies, and brought back my
heart to nobler sentiments than my condition had inspired; meantime
disgusted with all within my reach, and thinking everything charming
that was out of it, my present situation appeared extremely
miserable. My passions began to acquire strength, I felt their
influence, without knowing whither they would conduct me. I
sometimes, indeed, thought of my former follies, but sought no
further.
At this time my imagination took a turn which helped to calm my
increasing emotions; it was, to contemplate those situations in the
books I had read, which produced the most striking effect on my
mind; to recall, combine, and apply them to myself in such a manner,
as to become one of the personages my recollection presented, and
be continually in those fancied circumstances which were most
agreeable to my inclinations; in a word, by contriving to place myself
in these fictitious situations, the idea of my real one was in a great
measure obliterated.

This fondness for imaginary objects, and the facility with which I
could gain possession of them, completed my disgust for everything
around me, and fixed that inclination for solitude which has ever
since been predominant. We shall have more than once occasion to
remark the effects of a disposition, misanthropic and melancholy in
appearance, but which proceed, in fact, from a heart too affectionate,
too ardent, which, for want of similar dispositions, is constrained to
content itself with nonentities, and be satisfied with fiction. It is
sufficient, at present, to have traced the origin of a propensity which
has modified my passions, set bounds to each, and by giving too
much ardor to my wishes, has ever rendered me too indolent to
obtain them.
Thus I attained my sixteenth year, uneasy, discontented with
myself and everything that surrounded me; displeased with my
occupation; without enjoying the pleasures common to my age,
weeping without a cause, sighing I knew not why, and fond of my
chimerical ideas for want of more valuable realities.
Every Sunday, after sermon-time, my companions came to fetch
me out, wishing me to partake of their diversions. I would willingly
have been excused, but when once engaged in amusement, I was
more animated and enterprising than any of them; it was equally
difficult to engage or restrain me; indeed, this was ever a leading trait
in my character. In our country walks I was ever foremost, and never
thought of returning till reminded by some of my companions. I was
twice obliged to be from my master's the whole night, the city gates
having been shut before I could reach them. The reader may
imagine what treatment this procured me the following mornings; but
I was promised such a reception for the third, that I made a firm
resolution never to expose myself to the danger of it.
Notwithstanding my determination, I repeated this dreaded
transgression, my vigilance having been rendered useless by a
cursed captain, named M. Minutoli, who, when on guard, always
shut the gate he had charge of an hour before the usual time. I was
returning home with my two companions, and had got within half a
league of the city, when I heard them beat the tattoo; I redouble my
pace, I run with my utmost speed, I approach the bridge, see the
soldiers already at their posts, I call out to them in a suffocated

voice--it is too late; I am twenty paces from the guard, the first bridge
is already drawn up, and I tremble to see those terrible horns
advanced in the air which announce the fatal and inevitable destiny,
which from this moment began to pursue me.
I threw myself on the glacis in a transport of despair, while my
companions, who only laughed at the accident, immediately
determined what to do. My resolution, though different from theirs,
was equally sudden; on the spot, I swore never to return to my
master's, and the next morning, when my companions entered the
city, I bade them an eternal adieu, conjuring them at the same time
to inform my cousin Bernard of my resolution, and the place where
he might see me for the last time.
From the commencement of my apprenticeship I had seldom seen
him; at first, indeed, we saw each other on Sundays, but each
acquiring different habits, our meetings were less frequent. I am
persuaded his mother contributed greatly towards this change; he
was to consider himself as a person of consequence, I was a pitiful
apprentice; notwithstanding our relationship, equality no longer
subsisted between us, and it was degrading himself to frequent my
company. As he had a natural good heart his mother's lessons did
not take an immediate effect, and for some time he continued to visit
me.
Having learned my resolution, he hastened to the spot I had
appointed, not, however, to dissuade me from it, but to render my
flight agreeable, by some trifling presents, as my own resources
would not have carried me far. He gave me among other things, a
small sword, which I was very proud of, and took with me as far as
Turin, where absolute want constrained me to dispose of it. The
more I reflect on his behavior at this critical moment, the more I am
persuaded he followed the instructions of his mother, and perhaps
his father likewise: for, had he been left to his own feelings, he would
have endeavored to retain, or have been tempted to accompany me;
on the contrary, he encouraged the design, and when he saw me
resolutely determined to pursue it, without seeming much affected,
left me to my fate. We never saw or wrote to each other from that
time; I cannot but regret this loss, for his heart was essentially good,
and we seemed formed for a more lasting friendship.

Before I abandon myself to the fatality of my destiny, let me
contemplate for a moment the prospect that awaited me had I fallen
into the hands of a better master. Nothing could have been more
agreeable to my disposition, or more likely to confer happiness, than
the peaceful condition of a good artificer, in so respectable a line as
engravers are considered at Geneva. I could have obtained an easy
subsistence, if not a fortune; this would have bounded my ambition; I
should have had means to indulge in moderate pleasures, and
should have continued in my natural sphere, without meeting with
any temptation to go beyond it. Having an imagination sufficiently
fertile to embellish with its chimeras every situation, and powerful
enough to transport me from one to another, it was immaterial in
which I was fixed: that was best adapted to me, which, requiring the
least care or exertion, left the mind most at liberty; and this
happiness I should have enjoyed. In my native country, in the bosom
of my religion, family and friends, I should have passed a calm and
peaceful life, in the uniformity of a pleasing occupation, and among
connections dear to my heart. I should have been a good Christian,
a good citizen, a good friend, a good man. I should have relished my
condition, perhaps have been an honor to it, and after having passed
a life of happy obscurity, surrounded by my family, I should have died
at peace. Soon it may be forgotten, but while remembered it would
have been with tenderness and regret.
Instead of this--what a picture am I about to draw!--Alas! why
should I anticipate the miseries I have endured? The reader will have
but too much of the melancholy subject.

The moment in which fear had instigated my flight, did not seem
more terrible than that wherein I put my design in execution
appeared delightful. To leave my relations, my resources, while yet a
child, in the midst of my apprenticeship, before I had learned enough
of my business to obtain a subsistence; to run on inevitable misery
and danger: to expose myself in that age of weakness and
innocence to all the temptations of vice and despair; to set out in
search of errors, misfortunes, snares, slavery, and death; to endure
more intolerable evils than those I meant to shun, was the picture I
should have drawn, the natural consequence of my hazardous
enterprise. How different was the idea I entertained of it!--The
independence I seemed to possess was the sole object of my
contemplation; having obtained my liberty, I thought everything
attainable: I entered with confidence on the vast theatre of the world,
which my merit was to captivate: at every step I expected to find
amusements, treasures, and adventures; friends ready to serve, and
mistresses eager to please me; I had but to show myself, and the
whole universe would be interested in my concerns; not but I could
have been content with something less; a charming society, with
sufficient means, might have satisfied me. My moderation was such,
that the sphere in which I proposed to shine was rather
circumscribed, but then it was to possess the very quintessence of
enjoyment, and myself the principal object. A single castle, for
instance, might have bounded my ambition; could I have been the
favorite of the lord and lady, the daughter's lover, the son's friend,
and protector of the neighbors, I might have been tolerably content,
and sought no further.

In expectation of this modest fortune, I passed a few days in the
environs of the city, with some country people of my acquaintance,
who received me with more kindness than I should have met with in
town; they welcomed, lodged, and fed me cheerfully; I could be said
to live on charity, these favors were not conferred with a sufficient
appearance of superiority to furnish out the idea.
I rambled about in this manner till I got to Confignon, in Savoy, at
about two leagues distance from Geneva. The vicar was called M.
de Pontverre; this name, so famous in the history of the Republic,
caught my attention; I was curious to see what appearance the
descendants of the gentlemen of the spoon exhibited; I went,
therefore, to visit this M. de Pontverre, and was received with great
civility.
He spoke of the heresy of Geneva, declaimed on the authority of
holy mother church, and then invited me to dinner. I had little to
object to arguments which had so desirable a conclusion, and was
inclined to believe that priests, who gave such excellent dinners,
might be as good as our ministers. Notwithstanding M. de
Pontverre's pedigree, I certainly possessed most learning; but I
rather sought to be a good companion than an expert theologian;
and his Frangi wine, which I thought delicious, argued so powerfully
on his side, that I should have blushed at silencing so kind a host; I,
therefore, yielded him the victory, or rather declined the contest. Any
one who had observed my precaution, would certainly have
pronounced me a dissembler, though, in fact, I was only courteous.
Flattery, or rather condescension, is not always a vice in young
people; 'tis oftener a virtue. When treated with kindness, it is natural
to feel an attachment for the person who confers the obligation; we
do not acquiesce because we wish to deceive, but from dread of
giving uneasiness, or because we wish to avoid the ingratitude of
rendering evil for good. What interest had M. de Pontverre in
entertaining, treating with respect, and endeavoring to convince me?
None but mine; my young heart told me this, and I was penetrated
with gratitude and respect for the generous priest; I was sensible of
my superiority, but scorned to repay his hospitality by taking
advantage of it. I had no conception of hypocrisy in this forbearance,
or thought of changing my religion, nay, so far was the idea from

being familiar to me, that I looked on it with a degree of horror which
seemed to exclude the possibility of such an event; I only wished to
avoid giving offence to those I was sensible caressed me from that
motive; I wished to cultivate their good opinion, and meantime leave
them the hope of success by seeming less on my guard than I really
was. My conduct in this particular resembled the coquetry of some
very honest women, who, to obtain their wishes, without permitting
or promising anything, sometimes encourage hopes they never
mean to realize.
Reason, piety, and love of order, certainly demanded that instead
of being encouraged in my folly, I should have been dissuaded from
the ruin I was courting, and sent back to my family; and this conduct
any one that was actuated by genuine virtue would have pursued;
but it should be observed that though M. de Pontverre was a
religious man, he was not a virtuous one, but a bigot, who knew no
virtue except worshipping images and telling his beads, in a word, a
kind of missionary, who thought the height of merit consisted in
writing libels against the ministers of Geneva. Far from wishing to
send me back, he endeavored to favor my escape, and put it out of
my power to return even had I been so disposed. It was a thousand
to one but he was sending me to perish with hunger, or become a
villain; but all this was foreign to his purpose; he saw a soul snatched
from heresy, and restored to the bosom of the church: whether I was
an honest man or a knave was very immaterial, provided I went to
mass.
This ridiculous mode of thinking is not peculiar to Catholics; it is
the voice of every dogmatical persuasion where merit consists in
belief, and not in virtue.
"You are called by the Almighty," said M. de Pontverre; "go to
Annecy, where you will find a good and charitable lady, whom the
bounty of the king enables to turn souls from those errors she has
happily renounced." He spoke of a Madam de Warrens, a new
convert, to whom the priests contrived to send those wretches who
were disposed to sell their faith, and with these she was in a manner
constrained to share a pension of two thousand francs bestowed on
her by the King of Sardinia. I felt myself extremely humiliated at
being supposed to want the assistance of a good and charitable

lady. I had no objection to be accommodated with everything I stood
in need of, but did not wish to receive it on the footing of charity and
to owe this obligation to a devotee was still worse; notwithstanding
my scruples the persuasions of M. de Pontverre, the dread of
perishing with hunger, the pleasures I promised myself from the
journey, and hope of obtaining some desirable situation, determined
me; and I set out though reluctantly, for Annecy. I could easily have
reached it in a day, but being in no great haste to arrive there, it took
me three. My head was filled with the ideas of adventures, and I
approached every country-seat I saw in my way, in expectation of
having them realized. I had too much timidity to knock at the doors,
or even enter if I saw them open, but I did what I dared--which was
to sing under those windows that I thought had the most favorable
appearance; and was very much disconcerted to find I wasted my
breath to no purpose, and that neither old nor young ladies were
attracted by the melody of my voice, or the wit of my poetry, though
some songs my companions had taught me I thought excellent and
that I sung them incomparably. At length I arrived at Annecy, and
saw Madam de Warrens.
As this period of my life, in a great measure, determined my
character, I could not resolve to pass it lightly over. I was in the
middle of my sixteenth year, and though I could not be called
handsome, was well made for my height; I had a good foot, a well
turned leg, and animated countenance; a well proportioned mouth,
black hair and eyebrows, and my eyes, though small and rather too
far in my head, sparkling with vivacity, darted that innate fire which
inflamed my blood; unfortunately for me, I knew nothing of all this,
never having bestowed a single thought on my person till it was too
late to be of any service to me. The timidity common to my age was
heightened by a natural benevolence, which made me dread the
idea of giving pain. Though my mind had received some cultivation,
having seen nothing of the world, I was an absolute stranger to polite
address, and my mental acquisitions, so far from supplying this
defect, only served to increase my embarrassment, by making me
sensible of every deficiency.
Depending little, therefore, on external appearances, I had
recourse to other expedients: I wrote a most elaborate letter, where,

mingling all the flowers of rhetoric which I had borrowed from books
with the phrases of an apprentice, I endeavored to strike the
attention, and insure the good will of Madam de Warrens. I enclosed
M. de Pontverre's letter in my own and waited on the lady with a
heart palpitating with fear and expectation. It was Palm Sunday, of
the year
; I was informed she was that moment gone to church; I
hasten after her, overtake, and speak to her.--The place is yet fresh
in my memory--how can it be otherwise? often have I moistened it
with my tears and covered it with kisses.--Why cannot I enclose with
gold the happy spot, and render it the object of universal veneration?
Whoever wishes to honor monuments of human salvation would only
approach it on their knees.
It was a passage at the back of the house, bordered on the left
hand by a little rivulet, which separated it from the garden, and, on
the right, by the court yard wall; at the end was a private door which
opened into the church of the Cordeliers. Madam de Warrens was
just passing this door; but on hearing my voice, instantly turned
about. What an effect did the sight of her produce! I expected to see
a devout, forbidding old woman; M. de Pontverre's pious and worthy
lady could be no other in my conception; instead of which, I see a
face beaming with charms, fine blue eyes full of sweetness, a
complexion whose whiteness dazzled the sight, the form of an
enchanting neck, nothing escaped the eager eye of the young
proselyte; for that instant I was hers!--a religion preached by such
missionaries must lead to paradise!
My letter was presented with a trembling hand; she took it with a
smile --opened it, glanced an eye over M. de Pontverre's and again
returned to mine, which she read through and would have read
again, had not the footman that instant informed her that service was
beginning--"Child," said she, in a tone of voice which made every
nerve vibrate, "you are wandering about at an early age--it is really a
pity!"--and without waiting for an answer, added--"Go to my house,
bid them give you something for breakfast, after mass, I will speak to
you."
Louisa--Eleanora de Warrens was of the noble and ancient family
of La Tour de Pit, of Vevay, a city in the country of the Vaudois. She
was married very young to a M. de Warrens, of the house of Loys,

eldest son of M. de Villardin, of Lausanne; there were no children by
this marriage, which was far from being a happy one. Some
domestic uneasiness made Madam de Warrens take the resolution
of crossing the Lake, and throwing herself at the feet of Victor
Amadeus, who was then at Evian; thus abandoning her husband,
family, and country by a giddiness similar to mine, which precipitation
she, too, has found sufficient time and reason to lament.
The king, who was fond of appearing a zealous promoter of the
Catholic faith, took her under his protection, and complimented her
with a pension of fifteen hundred livres of Piedmont, which was a
considerable appointment for a prince who never had the character
of being generous; but finding his liberality made some conjecture he
had an affection for the lady, he sent her to Annecy escorted by a
detachment of his guards, where, under the direction of Michael
Gabriel de Bernex, titular bishop of Geneva, she abjured her former
religion at the Convent of the Visitation.
I came to Annecy just six years after this event; Madam de
Warrens was then eight--and--twenty, being born with the century.
Her beauty, consisting more in the expressive animation of the
countenance, than a set of features, was in its meridian; her manner
soothing and tender; an angelic smile played about her mouth, which
was small and delicate; she wore her hair (which was of an ash
color, and uncommonly beautiful) with an air of negligence that made
her appear still more interesting; she was short, and rather thick for
her height, though by no means disagreeably so; but there could not
be a more lovely face, a finer neck, or hands and arms more
exquisitely formed.
Her education had been derived from such a variety of sources,
that it formed an extraordinary assemblage. Like me, she had lost
her mother at her birth, and had received instruction as it chanced to
present itself; she had learned something of her governess,
something of her father, a little of her masters, but copiously from her
lovers; particularly a M. de Tavel, who, possessing both taste and
information, endeavored to adorn with them the mind of her he
loved. These various instructions, not being properly arranged,
tended to impede each other, and she did not acquire that degree of
improvement her natural good sense was capable of receiving; she

knew something of philosophy and physic, but not enough to
eradicate the fondness she had imbibed from her father for
empiricism and alchemy; she made elixirs, tinctures, balsams,
pretended to secrets, and prepared magestry; while quacks and
pretenders, profiting by her weakness, destroyed her property
among furnaces, drugs and minerals, diminishing those charms and
accomplishments which might have been the delight of the most
elegant circles. But though these interested wretches took
advantage of her ill-applied education to obscure her natural good
sense, her excellent heart retained its purity; her amiable mildness,
sensibility for the unfortunate, inexhaustible bounty, and open,
cheerful frankness, knew no variation; even at the approach of old
age, when attacked by various calamities, rendered more cutting by
indigence, the serenity of her disposition preserved to the end of her
life the pleasing gayety of her happiest days.
Her errors proceeded from an inexhaustible fund of activity, which
demanded perpetual employment. She found no satisfaction in the
customary intrigues of her sex, but, being formed for vast designs,
sought the direction of important enterprises and discoveries. In her
place Madam de Longueville would have been a mere trifler, in
Madam de Longueville's situation she would have governed the
state. Her talents did not accord with her fortune; what would have
gained her distinction in a more elevated sphere, became her ruin. In
enterprises which suited her disposition, she arranged the plan in her
imagination, which was ever carried of its utmost extent, and the
means she employed being proportioned rather to her ideas than
abilities, she failed by the mismanagement of those upon whom she
depended, and was ruined where another would scarce have been a
loser. This active disposition, which involved her in so many
difficulties, was at least productive of one benefit as it prevented her
from passing the remainder of her life in the monastic asylum she
had chosen, which she had some thought of. The simple and
uniform life of a nun, and the little cabals and gossipings of their
parlor, were not adapted to a mind vigorous and active, which, every
day forming new systems, had occasions for liberty to attempt their
completion.

The good bishop of Bernex, with less wit than Francis of Sales,
resembled him in many particulars, and Madam de Warrens, whom
he loved to call his daughter, and who was like Madam de Chantel in
several respects, might have increased the resemblance by retiring
like her from the world, had she not been disgusted with the idle
trifling of a convent. It was not want of zeal prevented this amiable
woman from giving those proofs of devotion which might have been
expected from a new convert, under the immediate direction of a
prelate. Whatever might have influenced her to change her religion,
she was certainly sincere in that she had embraced; she might find
sufficient occasion to repent having abjured her former faith, but no
inclination to return to it. She not only died a good Catholic, but truly
lived one; nay, I dare affirm (and I think I have had the opportunity to
read the secrets of her heart) that it was only her aversion to
singularity that prevented her acting the devotee in public; in a word,
her piety was too sincere to give way to any affectation of it. But this
is not the place to enlarge on her principles: I shall find other
occasions to speak of them.
Let those who deny the existence of a sympathy of souls, explain,
if they know how, why the first glance, the first word of Madam de
Warrens inspired me, not only with a lively attachment, but with the
most unbounded confidence, which has since known no abatement.
Say this was love (which will at least appear doubtful to those who
read the sequel of our attachment) how could this passion be
attended with sentiments which scarce ever accompany its
commencement, such as peace, serenity, security, and confidence.
How, when making application to an amiable and polished woman,
whose situation in life was so superior to mine, so far above any I
had yet approached, on whom, in a great measure, depended my
future fortune by the degree of interest she might take in it; how, I
say with so many reasons to depress me, did I feel myself as free,
as much at my ease, as if I had been perfectly secure of pleasing
her! Why did I not experience a moment of embarrassment, timidity
or restraint? Naturally bashful, easily confused, having seen nothing
of the world, could I, the first time, the first moment I beheld her,
adopt caressing language, and a familiar tone, as readily as after ten
years' intimacy had rendered these freedoms natural? Is it possible

to possess love, I will not say without desires, for I certainly had
them, but without inquietude, without jealousy? Can we avoid feeling
an anxious wish at least to know whether our affection is returned?
Yet such a question never entered my imagination; I should as soon
have inquired, do I love myself; nor did she ever express a greater
degree of curiosity; there was, certainly, something extraordinary in
my attachment to this charming woman and it will be found in the
sequel, that some extravagances, which cannot be foreseen,
attended it.
What could be done for me, was the present question, and in
order to discuss the point with greater freedom, she made me dine
with her. This was the first meal in my life where I had experienced a
want of appetite, and her woman, who waited, observed it was the
first time she had seen a traveller of my age and appearance
deficient in that particular: this remark, which did me no injury in the
opinion of her mistress, fell hard on an overgrown clown, who was
my fellow guest, and devoured sufficient to have served at least six
moderate feeders. For me, I was too much charmed to think of
eating; my heart began to imbibe a delicious sensation, which
engrossed my whole being, and left no room for other objects.
Madam de Warrens wished to hear the particulars of my little
history--all the vivacity I had lost during my servitude returned and
assisted the recital. In proportion to the interest this excellent woman
took in my story, did she lament the fate to which I had exposed
myself; compassion was painted on her features, and expressed by
every action. She could not exhort me to return to Geneva, being too
well aware that her words and actions were strictly scrutinized, and
that such advice would be thought high treason against Catholicism,
but she spoke so feelingly of the affliction I must give her(my) father,
that it was easy to perceive she would have approved my returning
to console him. Alas! she little thought how powerfully this pleaded
against herself; the more eloquently persuasive she appeared, the
less could I resolve to tear myself from her. I knew that returning to
Geneva would be putting an insuperable barrier between us, unless I
repeated the expedient which had brought me here, and it was
certainly better to preserve than expose myself to the danger of a
relapse; besides all this, my conduct was predetermined, I was

resolved not to return. Madam de Warrens, seeing her endeavors
would be fruitless, became less explicit, and only added, with an air
of commiseration, "Poor child! thou must go where Providence
directs thee, but one day thou wilt think of me."--I believe she had no
conception at that time how fatally her prediction would be verified.
The difficulty still remained how I was to gain a subsistence? I
have already observed that I knew too little of engraving for that to
furnish my resource, and had I been more expert, Savoy was too
poor a country to give much encouragement to the arts. The abovementioned glutton, who eat for us as well as himself, being obliged to
pause in order to gain some relaxation from the fatigue of it,
imparted a piece of advice, which, according to him, came express
from Heaven; though to judge by its effects it appeared to have been
dictated from a direct contrary quarter: this was that I should go to
Turin, where, in a hospital instituted for the instruction of
catechumens, I should find food, both spiritual and temporal, be
reconciled to the bosom of the church, and meet with some
charitable Christians, who would make it a point to procure me a
situation that would turn to my advantage. "In regard to the expenses
of the journey," continued our advisor, "his grace, my lord bishop, will
not be backward, when once madam has proposed this holy work, to
offer his charitable donation, and madam, the baroness, whose
charity is so well known," once more addressing himself to the
continuation of his meal, "will certainly contribute."
I was by no means pleased with all these charities; I said nothing,
but my heart was ready to burst with vexation. Madam de Warrens,
who did not seem to think so highly of this expedient as the projector
pretended to do, contented herself by saying, everyone should
endeavor to promote good actions, and that she would mention it to
his lordship; but the meddling devil, who had some private interest in
this affair, and questioned whether she would urge it to his
satisfaction, took care to acquaint the almoners with my story, and so
far influenced those good priests, that when Madam de Warrens,
who disliked the journey on my account, mentioned it to the bishop,
she found it so far concluded on, that he immediately put into her
hands the money designed for my little viaticum. She dared not
advance anything against it; I was approaching an age when a

woman like her could not, with any propriety, appear anxious to
retain me.
My departure being thus determined by those who undertook the
management of my concerns, I had only to submit; and I did it
without much repugnance. Though Turin was at a greater distance
from Madam de Warrens than Geneva, yet being the capital of the
country I was now in, it seemed to have more connection with
Annecy than a city under a different government and of a contrary
religion; besides, as I undertook this journey in obedience to her, I
considered myself as living under her direction, which was more
flattering than barely to continue in the neighborhood; to sum up all,
the idea of a long journey coincided with my insurmountable passion
for rambling, which already began to demonstrate itself. To pass the
mountains, to my eye appeared delightful; how charming the
reflection of elevating myself above my companions by the whole
height of the Alps! To see the world is an almost irresistible
temptation to a Genevan, accordingly I gave my consent.
He who suggested the journey was to set off in two days with his
wife. I was recommended to their care; they were likewise made my
purse --bearers, which had been augmented by Madam de Warrens,
who, not contented with these kindnesses, added secretly a
pecuniary reinforcement, attended with the most ample instructions,
and we departed on the Wednesday before Easter.
The day following, my father arrived at Annecy, accompanied by
his friend, a Mr. Rival, who was likewise a watchmaker; he was a
man of sense and letters, who wrote better verses than La Motte,
and spoke almost as well; what is still more to his praise, he was a
man of the strictest integrity, but whose taste for literature only
served to make one of his sons a comedian. Having traced me to the
house of Madam de Warrens, they contented themselves with
lamenting, like her, my fate, instead of overtaking me, which, (as
they were on horseback and I on foot) they might have accomplished
with the greatest ease.
My uncle Bernard did the same thing, he arrived at Consignon,
received information that I was gone to Annecy, and immediately
returned back to Geneva; thus my nearest relations seemed to have
conspired with my adverse stars to consign me to misery and ruin.

By a similar negligence, my brother was so entirely lost, that it was
never known what was become of him.
My father was not only a man of honor but of the strictest probity,
and endured with that magnanimity which frequently produces the
most shining virtues: I may add, he was a good father, particularly to
me whom he tenderly loved; but he likewise loved his pleasures, and
since we had been separated other connections had weakened his
paternal affections. He had married again at Nion, and though his
second wife was too old to expect children, she had relations; my
father was united to another family, surrounded by other objects, and
a variety of cares prevented my returning to his remembrance. He
was in the decline of life and had nothing to support the
inconveniences of old age; my mother's property devolved to me and
my brother, but, during our absence, the interest of it was enjoyed by
my father: I do not mean to infer that this consideration had an
immediate effect on his conduct, but it had an imperceptible one, and
prevented him making use of that exertion to regain me which he
would otherwise have employed; and this, I think, was the reason
that having traced me as far as Annecy, he stopped short, without
proceeding to Chambery, where he was almost certain I should be
found; and likewise accounts why, on visiting him several times since
my flight, he always received me with great kindness, but never
made any efforts to retain me.
This conduct in a father, whose affection and virtue I was so well
convinced of, has given birth to reflections on the regulation of my
own conduct which have greatly contributed to preserve the integrity
of my heart. It has taught me this great lesson of morality, perhaps
the only one that can have any conspicuous influence on our
actions, that we should ever carefully avoid putting our interests in
competition with our duty, or promise ourselves felicity from the
misfortunes of others; certain that in such circumstances, however
sincere our love of virtue may be, sooner or later it will give way and
we shall imperceptibly become unjust and wicked, in fact, however
upright in our intentions.
This maxim, strongly imprinted on my mind, and reduced, though
rather too late, to practice, has given my conduct an appearance of
folly and whimsicality, not only in public, but still more among my

acquaintances: it has been said, I affected originality, and sought to
act different from other people; the truth is, I neither endeavor to
conform or be singular, I desire only to act virtuously and avoid
situations, which, by setting my interest in opposition to that of
another person's, might inspire me with a secret, though involuntary
wish to his disadvantage.
Two years ago, My Lord Marshal would have put my name in his
will, which I took every method to prevent, assuring him I would not
for the world know myself in the will of any one, much less in his; he
gave up the idea; but insisted in return, that I should accept an
annuity on his life; this I consented to. It will be said, I find my
account in the alteration; perhaps I may; but oh, my benefactor! my
father, I am now sensible that, should I have the misfortune to
survive thee, I should have everything to lose, nothing to gain.
This, in my idea, in true philosophy, the surest bulwark of human
rectitude; every day do I receive fresh conviction of its profound
solidity. I have endeavored to recommend it in all my latter writings,
but the multitude read too superficially to have made the remark. If I
survive my present undertaking, and am able to begin another, I
mean, in a continuation of Emilius, to give such a lively and marking
example of this maxim as cannot fail to strike attention. But I have
made reflections enough for a traveller, it is time to continue my
journey.
It turned out more agreeable than I expected: my clownish
conductor was not so morose as he appeared to be. He was a
middle-aged man, wore his black, grizzly hair, in a queue, had a
martial air, a strong voice, was tolerably cheerful, and to make up for
not having been taught any trade, could turn his hand to every one.
Having proposed to establish some kind of manufactory at Annecy,
he had consulted Madam de Warrens, who immediately gave into
the project, and he was now going to Turin to lay the plan before the
minister and get his approbation, for which journey he took care to
be well rewarded.
This drole had the art of ingratiating himself with the priests, whom
he ever appeared eager to serve; he adopted a certain jargon which
he had learned by frequenting their company, and thought himself a
notable preacher; he could even repeat one passage from the Bible

in Latin, and it answered his purpose as well as if he had known a
thousand, for he repeated it a thousand times a day. He was seldom
at a loss for money when he knew what purse contained it; yet, was
rather artful than knavish, and when dealing out in an affected tone
his unmeaning discourses, resembled Peter the Hermit, preaching
up the crusade with a sabre at his side.
Madam Sabran, his wife, was a tolerable, good sort of woman;
more peaceable by day than by night; as I slept in the same
chamber I was frequently disturbed by her wakefulness, and should
have been more so had I comprehended the cause of it; but I was in
the chapter of dullness, which left to nature the whole care of my
own instruction.
I went on gayly with my pious guide and his hopeful companion,
no sinister accident impeding our journey. I was in the happiest
circumstances both of mind and body that I ever recollect having
experienced; young, full of health and security, placing unbounded
confidence in myself and others; in that short but charming moment
of human life, whose expansive energy carries, if I may so express
myself, our being to the utmost extent of our sensations,
embellishing all nature with an inexpressible charm, flowing from the
conscious and rising enjoyment of our existence.
My pleasing inquietudes became less wandering: I had now an
object on which imagination could fix. I looked on myself as the work,
the pupil, the friend, almost the lover of Madam de Warrens; the
obliging things she had said, the caresses she had bestowed on me;
the tender interest she seemed to take in everything that concerned
me; those charming looks, which seemed replete with love, because
they so powerfully inspired it, every consideration flattered my ideas
during this journey, and furnished the most delicious reveries, which,
no doubt, no fear of my future condition arose to embitter. In sending
me to Turin, I thought they engaged to find me an agreeable
subsistence there; thus eased of every care I passed lightly on, while
young desires, enchanting hopes, and brilliant prospects employed
my mind; each object that presented itself seemed to insure my
approaching felicity. I imagined that every house was filled with
joyous festivity, the meadows resounded with sports and revelry, the
rivers offered refreshing baths, delicious fish wantoned in these

streams, and how delightful was it to ramble along the flowery banks!
The trees were loaded with the choicest fruits, while their shade
afforded the most charming and voluptuous retreats to happy lovers;
the mountains abounded with milk and cream; peace and leisure,
simplicity and joy, mingled with the charm of going I knew not
whither, and everything I saw carried to my heart some new cause
for rapture. The grandeur, variety, and real beauty of the scene, in
some measure rendered the charm reasonable, in which vanity
came in for its share; to go so young to Italy, view such an extent of
country, and pursue the route of Hannibal over the Alps, appeared a
glory beyond my age; add to all this our frequent and agreeable
halts, with a good appetite and plenty to satisfy it; for in truth it was
not worth while to be sparing; at Mr. Sabran's table what I eat could
scarce be missed. In the whole course of my life I cannot recollect an
interval more perfectly exempt from care, than the seven or eight
days I was passing from Annecy to Turin. As we were obliged to
walk Madam Sabran's pace, it rather appeared an agreeable jaunt
than a fatiguing journey; there still remains the most pleasing
impressions of it on my mind, and the idea of a pedestrian excursion,
particularly among the mountains, has from this time seemed
delightful.
It was only in my happiest days that I travelled on foot, and ever
with the most unbounded satisfaction; afterwards, occupied with
business and encumbered with baggage, I was forced to act the
gentleman and employ a carriage, where care, embarrassment, and
restraint, were sure to be my companions, and instead of being
delighted with the journey, I only wished to arrive at the place of
destination.
I was a long time at Paris, wishing to meet with two companions of
similar dispositions, who would each agree to appropriate fifty
guineas of his property and a year of his time to making the tour of
Italy on foot, with no other attendance than a young fellow to carry
our necessaries; I have met with many who seemed enchanted with
the project, but considered it only as a visionary scheme, which
served well enough to talk of, without any design of putting it in
execution. One day, speaking with enthusiasm of this project to
Diderot and Grimm, they gave into the proposal with such warmth

that I thought the matter concluded on; but it only turned out a
journey on paper, in which Grimm thought nothing so pleasing as
making Diderot commit a number of impieties, and shutting me up in
the Inquisition for them, instead of him.
My regret at arriving so soon at Turin was compensated by the
pleasure of viewing a large city, and the hope of figuring there in a
conspicuous character, for my brain already began to be intoxicated
with the fumes of ambition; my present situation appeared infinitely
above that of an apprentice, and I was far from foreseeing how soon
I should be much below it.
Before I proceed, I ought to offer an excuse, or justification to the
reader for the great number of unentertaining particulars I am
necessitated to repeat. In pursuance of the resolution I have formed
to enter on this public exhibition of myself, it is necessary that
nothing should bear the appearance of obscurity or concealment. I
should be continually under the eye of the reader, he should be
enabled to follow me In all the wanderings of my heart, through
every intricacy of my adventures; he must find no void or chasm in
my relation, nor lose sight of me an instant, lest he should find
occasion to say, what was he doing at this time; and suspect me of
not having dared to reveal the whole. I give sufficient scope to
malignity in what I say; it is unnecessary I should furnish still more by
my science.
My money was all gone, even that I had secretly received from
Madam de Warrens: I had been so indiscreet as to divulge this
secret, and my conductors had taken care to profit by it. Madam
Sabran found means to deprive me of everything I had, even to a
ribbon embroidered with silver, with which Madam de Warrens had
adorned the hilt of my sword; this I regretted more than all the rest;
indeed the sword itself would have gone the same way, had I been
less obstinately bent on retaining it. They had, it is true, supported
me during the journey, but left me nothing at the end of it, and I
arrived at Turin, without money, clothes, or linen, being precisely in
the situation to owe to my merit alone the whole honor of that fortune
I was about to acquire.
I took care in the first place to deliver the letters I was charged
with, and was presently conducted to the hospital of the

catechumens, to be instructed in that religion, for which, in return, I
was to receive subsistence. On entering, I passed an iron-barred
gate, which was immediately double-locked on me; this beginning
was by no means calculated to give me a favorable opinion of my
situation. I was then conducted to a large apartment, whose furniture
consisted of a wooden altar at the farther end, on which was a large
crucifix, and round it several indifferent chairs, of the same materials.
In this hall of audience were assembled four or five ill-looking
banditti, my comrades in instruction, who would rather have been
taken for trusty servants of the devil than candidates for the kingdom
of heaven. Two of these fellows were Sclavonians, but gave out they
were African Jews, and (as they assured me) had run through Spain
and Italy, embracing the Christian faith, and being baptised wherever
they thought it worth their labor.
Soon after they opened another iron gate, which divided a large
balcony that overlooked a court yard, and by this avenue entered our
sister catechumens, who, like me, were going to be regenerated, not
by baptism but a solemn abjuration. A viler set of idle, dirty,
abandoned harlots, never disgraced any persuasion; one among
them, however, appeared pretty and interesting; she might be about
my own age, perhaps a year or two older, and had a pair of roguish
eyes, which frequently encountered mine; this was enough to inspire
me with the desire of becoming acquainted with her, but she had
been so strongly recommended to the care of the old governess of
this respectable sisterhood, and was so narrowly watched by the
pious missionary, who labored for her conversion with more zeal
than diligence, that during the two months we remained together in
this house (where she had already been three) I found it absolutely
impossible to exchange a word with her. She must have been
extremely stupid, though she had not the appearance of it, for never
was a longer course of instruction; the holy man could never bring
her to a state of mind fit for abjuration; meantime she became weary
of her cloister, declaring that, Christian or not, she would stay there
no longer; and they were obliged to take her at her word, lest she
should grow refractory, and insist on departing as great a sinner as
she came.

This hopeful community were assembled in honor of the newcomer; when our guides made us a short exhortation: I was conjured
to be obedient to the grace that Heaven had bestowed on me; the
rest were admonished to assist me with their prayers, and give me
edification by their good example. Our virgins then retired to another
apartment, and I was left to contemplate, at leisure, that wherein I
found myself.
The next morning we were again assembled for instruction: I now
began to reflect, for the first time, on the step I was about to take,
and the circumstances which had led me to it.
I repeat, and shall perhaps repeat again, an assertion I have
already advanced, and of whose truth I every day receive fresh
conviction, which is, that if ever child received a reasonable and
virtuous education, it was myself. Born in a family of unexceptionable
morals, every lesson I received was replete with maxims of prudence
and virtue. My father (though fond of gallantry) not only possessed
distinguished probity, but much religion; in the world he appeared a
man of pleasure, in his family he was a Christian, and implanted
early in my mind those sentiments he felt the force of. My three
aunts were women of virtue and piety; the two eldest were professed
devotees, and the third, who united all the graces of wit and good
sense, was, perhaps, more truly religious than either, though with
less ostentation. From the bosom of this amiable family I was
transplanted to M. Lambercier's, a man dedicated to the ministry,
who believed the doctrine he taught, and acted up to its precepts. He
and his sister matured by their instructions those principles of
judicious piety I had already imbibed, and the means employed by
these worthy people were so well adapted to the effect they meant to
produce, that so far from being fatigued, I scarce ever listened to
their admonitions without finding myself sensibly affected, and
forming resolutions to live virtuously, from which, except in moments
of forgetfulness, I seldom swerved. At my uncle's, religion was far
more tiresome, because they made it an employment; with my
master I thought no more of it, though my sentiments continued the
same: I had no companions to vitiate my morals: I became idle,
careless, and obstinate, but my principles were not impaired.

I possessed as much religion, therefore, as a child could be
supposed capable of acquiring. Why should I now disguise my
thoughts? I am persuaded I had more. In my childhood, I was not a
child; I felt, I thought as a man: as I advanced in years, I mingled
with the ordinary class; in my infancy I was distinguished from it. I
shall doubtless incur ridicule by thus modestly holding myself up for
a prodigy--I am content. Let those who find themselves disposed to
it, laugh their fill; afterward, let them find a child that at six years old
is delighted, interested, affected with romances, even to the
shedding floods of tears; I shall then feel my ridiculous vanity, and
acknowledge myself in an error.
Thus when I said we should not converse with children on religion,
if we wished them ever to possess any; when I asserted they were
incapable of communion with the Supreme Being, even in our
confined degree, I drew my conclusions from general observation; I
knew they were not applicable to particular instances: find J. J.
Rousseau of six years old, converse with them on religious subjects
at seven, and I will be answerable that the experiment will be
attended with no danger.
It is understood, I believe, that a child, or even a man, is likely to
be most sincere while persevering in that religion in whose belief he
was born and educated; we frequently detract from, seldom make
any additions to it: dogmatical faith is the effect of education. In
addition to this general principle which attached me to the religion of
my forefathers, I had that particular aversion our city entertains for
Catholicism, which is represented there as the most monstrous
idolatry, and whose clergy are painted in the blackest colors. This
sentiment was so firmly imprinted on my mind, that I never dared to
look into their churches--I could not bear to meet a priest in his
surplice, and never did I hear the bells of a procession sound without
shuddering with horror; these sensations soon wore off in great
cities, but frequently returned in country parishes, which bore more
similarity to the spot where I first experienced them; meantime this
dislike was singularly contrasted by the remembrance of those
caresses which priests in the neighborhood of Geneva are fond of
bestowing on the children of that city. If the bells of the viaticum
alarmed me, the chiming for mass or vespers called me to a

breakfast, a collation, to the pleasure of regaling on fresh butter,
fruits, or milk; the good cheer of M. de Pontverre had produced a
considerable effect on me; my former abhorrence began to diminish,
and looking on popery through the medium of amusement and good
living, I easily reconciled myself to the idea of enduring, though I
never entertained but a very transient and distant idea of making a
solemn profession of it.
At this moment such a transaction appeared in all its horrors; I
shuddered at the engagement I had entered into, and its inevitable
consequences. The future neophytes with which I was surrounded
were not calculated to sustain my courage by their example, and I
could not help considering the holy work I was about to perform as
the action of a villain. Though young, I was sufficiently convinced,
that whatever religion might be the true one, I was about to sell mine;
and even should I chance to chose the best, I lied to the Holy Ghost,
and merited the disdain of every good man. The more I considered,
the more I despised myself, and trembled at the fate which had led
me into such a predicament, as if my present situation had not been
of my own seeking. There were moments when these compunctions
were so strong that had I found the door open but for an instant, I
should certainly have made my escape; but this was impossible, nor
was the resolution of any long duration, being combated by too many
secret motives to stand any chance of gaining the victory.
My fixed determination not to return to Geneva, the shame that
would attend it, the difficulty of repassing the mountains, at a
distance from my country, without friends, and without resources,
everything concurred to make me consider my remorse of
conscience, as a too late repentance. I affected to reproach myself
for what I had done, to seek excuses for that I intended to do, and by
aggravating the errors of the past, looked on the future as an
inevitable consequence. I did not say, nothing is yet done, and you
may be innocent if you please; but I said, tremble at the crime thou
hast committed, which hath reduced thee to the necessity of filling up
the measure of thine iniquities.
It required more resolution than was natural to my age to revoke
those expectations which I had given them reason to entertain, break
those chains with which I was enthralled, and resolutely declare I

would continue in the religion of my forefathers, whatever might be
the consequence. The affair was already too far advanced, and spite
of all my efforts they would have made a point of bringing it to a
conclusion.
The sophism which ruined me has had a similar affect on the
greater part of mankind, who lament the want of resolution when the
opportunity for exercising it is over. The practice of virtue is only
difficult from our own negligence; were, we always discreet, we
should seldom have occasion for any painful exertion of it; we are
captivated by desires we might readily surmount, give into
temptations that might easily be resisted, and insensibly get into
embarrassing, perilous situations, from which we cannot extricate
ourselves but with the utmost difficulty; intimidated by the effort, we
fall into the abyss, saying to the Almighty, why hast thou made us
such weak creatures? But, notwithstanding our vain pretexts, He
replies, by our consciences, I formed ye too weak to get out of the
gulf, because I gave ye sufficient strength not to have fallen into it.
I was not absolutely resolved to become a Catholic, but, as it was
not necessary to declare my intentions immediately, I gradually
accustomed myself to the idea; hoping, meantime, that some
unforeseen event would extricate me from my embarrassment. In
order to gain time, I resolved to make the best defence I possibly
could in favor of my own opinion; but my vanity soon rendered this
resolution unnecessary, for on finding I frequently embarrassed
those who had the care of my instruction, I wished to heighten my
triumph by giving them a complete overthrow. I zealously pursued
my plan, not without the ridiculous hope of being able to convert my
convertors; for I was simple enough to believe, that could I convince
them of their errors, they would become Protestants; they did not
find, therefore, that facility in the work which they had expected, as I
differed both in regard to will and knowledge from the opinion they
had entertained of me.
Protestants, in general, are better instructed in the principles of
their religion than Catholics; the reason is obvious; the doctrine of
the former requires discussion, of the latter a blind submission; the
Catholic must content himself with the decisions of others, the
Protestant must learn to decide for himself; they were not ignorant of

this, but neither my age nor appearance promised much difficulty to
men so accustomed to disputation. They knew, likewise, that I had
not received my first communion, nor the instructions which
accompany it; but, on the other hand, they had no idea of the
information I received at M. Lambercier's, or that I had learned the
history of the church and empire almost by heart at my father's; and
though (since that time, nearly forgot, when warmed by the dispute,
very unfortunately for these gentlemen), it again returned to my
memory.
A little old priest, but tolerably venerable, held the first conference;
at which we were all convened. On the part of my comrades, it was
rather a catechism than a controversy, and he found more pains in
giving them instruction than answering their objections; but when it
came to my turn, it was a different matter; I stopped him at every
article, and did not spare a single remark that I thought would create
a difficulty: this rendered the conference long and extremely
tiresome to the assistants. My old priest talked a great deal, was
very warm, frequently rambled from the subject, and extricated
himself from difficulties by saying he was not sufficiently versed in
the French language.
The next day, lest my indiscreet objections should injure the minds
of those who were better disposed, I was led into a separate
chamber and put under the care of a younger priest, a fine speaker;
that is, one who was fond of long perplexed sentences, and proud of
his own abilities, if ever doctor was. I did not, however, suffer myself
to be intimidated by his overbearing looks: and being sensible that I
could maintain my ground, I combated his assertions, exposed his
mistakes, and laid about me in the best manner I was able. He
thought to silence me at once with St. Augustine, St. Gregory, and
the rest of the fathers, but found, to his ineffable surprise, that I could
handle these almost as dexterously as himself; not that I had ever
read them, or he either, perhaps, but I retained a number of
passages taken from my Le Sueur, and when he bore hard on me
with one citation, without standing to dispute, I parried it with another,
which method embarrassed him extremely. At length, however, he
got the better of me for two very potent reasons; in the first place, he
was of the strongest side; young as I was, I thought it might be

dangerous to drive him to extremities, for I plainly saw the old priest
was neither satisfied with me nor my erudition. In the next place, he
had studied, I had not; this gave a degree of method to his
arguments which I could not follow; and whenever he found himself
pressed by an unforeseen objection he put it off to the next
conference, pretending I rambled from the question in dispute.
Sometimes he even rejected all my quotations, maintaining they
were false, and, offering to fetch the book, defied me to find them.
He knew he ran very little risk, and that, with all my borrowed
learning, I was not sufficiently accustomed to books, and too poor a
Latinist to find a passage in a large volume, had I been ever so well
assured it was there. I even suspected him of having been guilty of a
perfidy with which he accused our ministers, and that he fabricated
passages sometimes in order to evade an objection that
incommoded him.
Meanwhile the hospital became every day more disagreeable to
me, and seeing but one way to get out of it, I endeavored to hasten
my abjuration with as much eagerness as I had hitherto sought to
retard it.
The two Africans had been baptised with great ceremony, they
were habited in white from head to foot to signify the purity of their
regenerated souls. My turn came a month after; for all this time was
thought necessary by my directors, that they might have the honor of
a difficult conversion, and every dogma of their faith was
recapitulated, in order to triumph the more completely over my new
docility.
At length, sufficiently instructed and disposed to the will of my
masters, I was led in procession to the metropolitan church of St.
John, to make a solemn abjuration, and undergo a ceremony made
use of on these occasions, which, though not baptism, is very
similar, and serves to persuade the people that Protestants are not
Christians. I was clothed in a kind of gray robe, decorated with white
Brandenburgs. Two men, one behind, the other before me, carried
copper basins which they kept striking with a key, and in which those
who were charitably disposed put their alms, according as they
found themselves influenced by religion or good will for the new
convert; in a word, nothing of Catholic pageantry was omitted that

could render the solemnity edifying to the populace, or humiliating to
me. The white dress might have been serviceable, but as I had not
the honor to be either Moor or Jew, they did not think fit to
compliment me with it.
The affair did not end here, I must now go to the Inquisition to be
absolved from the dreadful sin of heresy, and return to the bosom of
the church with the same ceremony to which Henry the Fourth was
subjected by his ambassador. The air and manner of the right
reverend Father Inquisitor was by no means calculated to dissipate
the secret horror that seized my spirits on entering this holy mansion.
After several questions relative to my faith, situation, and family, he
asked me bluntly if my mother was damned? Terror repressed the
first gust of indignation; this gave me time to recollect myself, and I
answered, I hope not, for God might have enlightened her last
moments. The monk made no reply, but his silence was attended
with a look by no means expressive of approbation.
All these ceremonies ended, the very moment I flattered myself I
should be plentifully provided for, they exhorted me to continue a
good Christian, and live in obedience to the grace I had received;
then wishing me good fortune, with rather more than twenty francs of
small money in my pocket, the produce of the above--mentioned
collection, turned me out, shut the door on me, and I saw no more of
them!
Thus, in a moment, all my flattering expectations were at an end;
and nothing remained from my interested conversion but the
remembrance of having been made both a dupe and an apostate. It
is easy to imagine what a sudden revolution was produced in my
ideas, when every brilliant expectation of making a fortune
terminated by seeing myself plunged in the completest misery. In the
morning I was deliberating what palace I should inhabit, before night
I was reduced to seek my lodging in the street. It may be supposed
that I gave myself up to the most violent transports of despair,
rendered more bitter by a consciousness that my own folly had
reduced me to these extremities; but the truth is, I experienced none
of these disagreeable sensations. I had passed two months in
absolute confinement; this was new to me; I was now emancipated,
and the sentiment I felt most forcibly, was joy at my recovered liberty.

After a slavery which had appeared tedious, I was again master of
my time and actions, in a great city, abundant in resources, crowded
with people of fortune, to whom my merit and talents could not fail to
recommend me. I had sufficient time before me to expect this good
fortune, for my twenty livres seemed an inexhaustible treasure,
which I might dispose of without rendering an account of to anyone.
It was the first time I had found myself so rich, and far from giving
way to melancholy reflections, I only adopted other hopes, in which
self-love was by no means a loser. Never did I feel so great a degree
of confidence and security; I looked on my fortune as already made
and was pleased to think I should have no one but myself to thank
for the acquisition of it.
The first thing I did was to satisfy my curiosity by rambling all over
the city, and I seemed to consider it as a confirmation of my liberty; I
went to see the soldiers mount guard, and was delighted with their
military accouterment; I followed processions, and was pleased with
the solemn music of the priests; I next went to see the king's palace,
which I approached with awe, but seeing others enter, I followed
their example, and no one prevented me; perhaps I owed this favor
to the small parcel I carried under my arm; be that as it may, I
conceived a high opinion of my consequence from this circumstance,
and already thought myself an inhabitant there. The weather was
hot; I had walked about till I was both fatigued and hungry; wishing
for some refreshment, I went into a milk-house; they brought me
some cream-cheese curds and whey, and two slices of that excellent
Piedmont bread, which I prefer to any other; and for five or six sous I
had one of the most delicious meals I ever recollect to have made.
It was time to seek a lodging: as I already knew enough of the
Piedmontese language to make myself understood, this was a work
of no great difficulty; and I had so much prudence, that I wished to
adapt it rather to the state of my purse than the bent of my
inclinations. In the course of my inquiries, I was informed that a
soldier's wife, in Po-street, furnished lodgings to servants out of
place at only one sou a night, and finding one of her poor beds
disengaged, I took possession of it. She was young and newly
married, though she already had five or six children. Mother, children
and lodgers, all slept in the same chamber, and it continued thus

while I remained there. She was good-natured, swore like a carman,
and wore neither cap nor handkerchief; but she had a gentle heart,
was officious; and to me both kind and serviceable.
For several days I gave myself up to the pleasures of
independence and curiosity; I continued wandering about the city
and its environs, examining every object that seemed curious or
new; and, indeed, most things had that appearance to a young
novice. I never omitted visiting the court, and assisted regularly
every morning at the king's mass. I thought it a great honor to be in
the same chapel with this prince and his retinue; but my passion for
music, which now began to make its appearance, was a greater
incentive than the splendor of the court, which, soon seen and
always the same, presently lost its attraction. The King of Sardinia
had at that time the best music in Europe; Somis, Desjardins, and
the Bezuzzi shone there alternately; all these were not necessary to
fascinate a youth whom the sound of the most simple instrument,
provided it was just, transported with joy. Magnificence only
produced a stupid admiration, without any violent desire to partake of
it, my thoughts were principally employed in observing whether any
young princess was present that merited my homage, and whom I
could make the heroine of a romance.
Meantime, I was on the point of beginning one; in a less elevated
sphere, it is true, but where could I have brought it to a conclusion, I
should have found pleasures a thousand times more delicious.
Though I lived with the strictest economy, my purse insensibly
grew lighter. This economy was, however, less the effect of prudence
than that love of simplicity, which, even to this day, the use of the
most expensive tables has not been able to vitiate. Nothing in my
idea, either at that time or since, could exceed a rustic repast; give
me milk, vegetables, eggs, and brown bread, with tolerable wine and
I shall always think myself sumptuously regaled; a good appetite will
furnish out the rest, if the maitre d' hotel, with a number of
unnecessary footmen, do not satiate me with their important
attentions. Five or six sous would then procure me a more agreeable
meal than as many livres would have done since; I was abstemious,
therefore, for want of a temptation to be otherwise: though I do not
know but I am wrong to call this abstinence, for with my pears, new

cheese, bread and some glasses of Montferrat wine, which you
might have cut with a knife, I was the greatest of epicures.
Notwithstanding my expenses were very moderate, it was possible
to see the end of twenty livres; I was every day more convinced of
this, and, spite of the giddiness of youth, my apprehensions for the
future amounted almost to terror. All my castles in the air were
vanished, and I became sensible of the necessity of seeking some
occupation that would procure me a subsistence.
Even this was a work of difficulty; I thought of my engraving, but
knew too little of it to be employed as a journeyman, nor do masters
abound in Turin; I resolved, therefore, till something better presented
itself, to go from shop to shop, offering to engrave ciphers, or coats
of arms, on pieces of plate, etc., and hoped to get employment by
working at a low price; or taking what they chose to give me. Even
this expedient did not answer my expectations; almost all my
applications were ineffectual, the little I procured being hardly
sufficient to produce a few scanty meals.
Walking one morning pretty early in the 'Contra nova', I saw a
young tradeswoman behind a counter, whose looks were so
charmingly attractive, that, notwithstanding my timidity with the
ladies, I entered the shop without hesitation, offered my services as
usual: and had the happiness to have it accepted. She made me sit
down and recite my little history, pitied my forlorn situation; bade me
be cheerful, and endeavored to make me so by an assurance that
every good Christian would give me assistance; then (while she had
occasion for) she went up stairs and fetched me something for
breakfast. This seemed a promising beginning, nor was what
followed less flattering: she was satisfied with my work, and, when I
had a little recovered myself, still more with my discourse. She was
rather elegantly dressed and notwithstanding her gentle looks this
appearance of gayety had disconcerted me; but her good-nature, the
compassionate tone of her voice, with her gentle and caressing
manner, soon set me at ease with myself; I saw my endeavors to
please were crowned with success, and this assurance made me
succeed the more. Though an Italian, and too pretty to be entirely
devoid of coquetry, she had so much modesty, and I so great a
share of timidity, that our adventure was not likely to be brought to a

very speedy conclusion, nor did they give us time to make any good
of it. I cannot recall the few short moments I passed with this lovely
woman without being sensible of an inexpressible charm, and can
yet say, it was there I tasted in their utmost perfection the most
delightful, as well as the purest pleasures of love.
She was a lively pleasing brunette, and the good nature that was
painted on her lovely face rendered her vivacity more interesting.
She was called Madam Basile: her husband, who was considerably
older than herself, consigned her, during his absence, to the care of
a clerk, too disagreeable to be thought dangerous; but who,
notwithstanding, had pretensions that he seldom showed any signs
of, except of ill--humors, a good share of which he bestowed on me;
though I was pleased to hear him play the flute, on which he was a
tolerable musician. This second Egistus was sure to grumble
whenever he saw me go into his mistress' apartment, treating me
with a degree of disdain which she took care to repay him with
interest; seeming pleased to caress me in his presence, on purpose
to torment him. This kind of revenge, though perfectly to my taste,
would have been still more charming in a 'tete a tete', but she did not
proceed so far; at least, there was a difference in the expression of
her kindness. Whether she thought me too young, that it was my
place to make advances, or that she was seriously resolved to be
virtuous, she had at such times a kind of reserve, which, though not
absolutely discouraging, kept my passion within bounds.
I did not feel the same real and tender respect for her as I did for
Madam de Warrens: I was embarrassed, agitated, feared to look,
and hardly dared to breathe in her presence, yet to have left her
would have been worse than death: How fondly did my eyes devour
whatever they could gaze on without being perceived! the flowers on
her gown, the point of her pretty foot, the interval of a round white
arm that appeared between her glove and ruffle, the least part of her
neck, each object increased the force of all the rest, and added to
the infatuation. Gazing thus on what was to be seen, and even more
than was to be seen, my sight became confused, my chest seemed
contracted, respiration was every moment more painful. I had the
utmost difficulty to hide my agitation, to prevent my sighs from being
heard, and this difficulty was increased by the silence in which we

were frequently plunged. Happily, Madam Basile, busy at her work,
saw nothing of all this, or seemed not to see it: yet I sometimes
observed a kind of sympathy, especially at the frequent rising of her
handkerchief, and this dangerous sight almost mastered every effort,
but when on the point of giving way to my transports, she spoke a
few words to me with an air of tranquility, and in an instant the
agitation subsided.
I saw her several times in this manner without a word, a gesture,
or even a look, too expressive, making the least intelligence between
us. The situation was both my torment and delight, for hardly in the
simplicity of my heart, could I imagine the cause of my uneasiness. I
should suppose these 'tete a tete' could not be displeasing to her, at
least, she sought frequent occasions to renew them; this was a very
disinterested labor, certainly, as appeared by the use she made, or
ever suffered me to make of them.
Being, one day, wearied with the clerk's discourse, she had retired
to her chamber; I made haste to finish what I had to do in the back
shop, and followed her; the door was half open, and I entered
without being perceived. She was embroidering near a window on
the opposite side of the room; she could not see me; and the carts in
the streets made too much noise for me to be heard. She was
always well dressed, but this day her attire bordered on coquetry.
Her attitude was graceful, her head leaning gently forward,
discovered a small circle of her neck; her hair, elegantly dressed was
ornamented with flowers; her figure was universally charming, and I
had an uninterrupted opportunity to admire it. I was absolutely in a
state of ecstasy, and, involuntary, sinking on my knees, I
passionately extended my arms towards her, certain she could not
hear, and having no conception that she could see me; but there was
a chimney glass at the end of the room that betrayed all my
proceedings. I am ignorant what effect this transport produced on
her; she did not speak; she did not look on me; but, partly turning her
head, with the movement of her finger only, she pointed to the mat
that was at her feet--To start up, with an articulate cry of joy, and
occupy the place she had indicated, was the work of a moment; but
it will hardly be believed I dared attempt no more, not even to speak,
raise my eyes to hers, or rest an instant on her knees, though in an

attitude which seemed to render such a support necessary. I was
dumb, immovable, but far enough from a state of tranquility;
agitation, joy, gratitude, ardent indefinite wishes, restrained by the
fear of giving displeasure, which my unpractised heart too much
dreaded, were sufficiently discernible. She neither appeared more
tranquil, nor less intimidated than myself--uneasy at my present
situation; confounded at having brought me there, beginning to
tremble for the effects of a sign which she had made without
reflecting on the consequences, neither giving encouragement, nor
expressing disapprobation, with her eyes fixed on her work, she
endeavored to appear unconscious of everything that passed; but all
my stupidity could not hinder me from concluding that she partook of
my embarrassment, perhaps, my transports, and was only hindered
by a bashfulness like mine, without even that supposition giving me
power to surmount it. Five or six years older than myself, every
advance, according to my idea, should have been made by her, and,
since she did nothing to encourage mine, I concluded they would
offend her. Even at this time, I am inclined to believe I thought right;
she certainly had wit enough to perceive that a novice like me had
occasion, not only for encouragement but instruction.
I am ignorant how this animated, though dumb scene would have
ended, or how long I should have continued immovable in this
ridiculous, though delicious, situation, had we not been interrupted-in the height of my agitation, I heard the kitchen door open, which
joined Madam Basile's chamber; who, being alarmed, said, with a
quick voice and action, "Get up! Here's Rosina!" Rising hastily I
seized one of her hands, which she held out to me, and gave it two
eager kisses; at the second I felt this charming hand press gently on
my lips. Never in my life did I enjoy so sweet a moment; but the
occasion I had lost returned no more, this being the conclusion of
our amours.
This may be the reason why her image yet remains imprinted on
my heart in such charming colors, which have even acquired fresh
lustre since I became acquainted with the world and women. Had
she been mistress of the least degree of experience, she would have
taken other measures to animate so youthful a lover; but if her heart
was weak, it was virtuous; and only suffered itself to be borne away

by a powerful though involuntary inclination. This was, apparently,
her first infidelity, and I should, perhaps, have found more difficulty in
vanquishing her scruples than my own; but, without proceeding so
far, I experienced in her company the most inexpressible delights.
Never did I taste with any other woman pleasures equal to those two
minutes which I passed at the feet of Madam Basile without even
daring to touch her gown. I am convinced no satisfaction can be
compared to that we feel with a virtuous woman we esteem; all is
transport!--A sign with the finger, a hand lightly pressed against my
lips, were the only favors I ever received from Madam Basile, yet the
bare remembrance of these trifling condescensions continues to
transport me.
It was in vain I watched the two following days for another tete a
tete; it was impossible to find an opportunity; nor could I perceive on
her part any desire to forward it; her behavior was not colder, but
more distant than usual, and I believe she avoided my looks for fear
of not being able sufficiently to govern her own. The cursed clerk
was more vexatious than ever; he even became a wit, telling me,
with a satirical sneer, that I should unquestionably make my way
among the ladies. I trembled lest I should have been guilty of some
indiscretion, and looking at myself as already engaged in an intrigue,
endeavored to cover with an air of mystery an inclination which
hitherto certainly had no great need of it; this made me more
circumspect in my choice of opportunities, and by resolving only to
seize such as should be absolutely free from the danger of a
surprise, I met none.
Another romantic folly, which I could never overcome, and which,
joined to my natural timidity, tended directly to contradict the clerk's
predictions, is, I always loved too sincerely, too perfectly, I may say,
to find happiness easily attainable. Never were passions at the same
time more lively and pure than mine; never was love more tender,
more true, or more disinterested; freely would I have sacrificed my
own happiness to that of the object of my affection; her reputation
was dearer than my life, and I could promise myself no happiness for
which I would have exposed her peace of mind for a moment. This
disposition has ever made me employ so much care, use so many
precautions, such secrecy in my adventures, that all of them have

failed; in a word, my want of success with the women has ever
proceeded from having loved them too well.
To return to our Egistus, the fluter; it was remarkable that in
becoming more insupportable, the traitor put on the appearance of
complaisance. From the first day Madam Basile had taken me under
her protection, she had endeavored to make me serviceable in the
warehouse; and finding I understood arithmetic tolerably well, she
proposed his teaching me to keep the books; a proposition that was
but indifferently received by this humorist, who might, perhaps, be
fearful of being supplanted. As this failed, my whole employ, besides
what engraving I had to do, was to transcribe some bills and
accounts, to write several books over fair, and translate commercial
letters from Italian into French. All at once he thought fit to accept the
before rejected proposal, saying, he would teach me bookkeeping,
by double--entry, and put me in a situation to offer my services to M.
Basile on his return; but there was something so false, malicious,
and ironical, in his air and manner, that it was by no means
calculated to inspire me with confidence. Madam Basile, replied
archly, that I was much obliged to him for his kind offer, but she
hoped fortune would be more favorable to my merits, for it would be
a great misfortune, with so much sense, that I should only be a pitiful
clerk.
She often said, she would procure me some acquaintance that
might be useful; she doubtless felt the necessity of parting with me,
and had prudently resolved on it. Our mute declaration had been
made on Thursday, the Sunday following she gave a dinner. A
Jacobin of good appearance was among the guests, to whom she
did me the honor to present me. The monk treated me very
affectionately, congratulated me on my late conversion, mentioned
several particulars of my story, which plainly showed he had been
made acquainted with it, then, tapping me familiarly on the cheek,
bade me be good, to keep up my spirits, and come to see him at his
convent, where he should have more opportunity to talk with me. I
judged him to be a person of some consequence by the deference
that was paid him; and by the paternal tone he assumed with Madam
Basile, to be her confessor. I likewise remember that his decent
familiarity was attended with an appearance of esteem, and even

respect for his fair penitent, which then made less impression on me
than at present. Had I possessed more experience how should I
have congratulated myself on having touched the heart of a young
woman respected by her confessor!
The table not being large enough to accommodate all the
company, a small one was prepared, where I had the satisfaction of
dining with our agreeable clerk; but I lost nothing with regard to
attention and good cheer, for several plates were sent to the sidetable which were certainly not intended for him.
Thus far all went well; the ladies were in good spirits, and the
gentlemen very gallant, while Madam Basile did the honors of the
table with peculiar grace. In the midst of the dinner we heard a
chaise stop at the door, and presently some one coming up stairs--it
was M. Basile. Methinks I now see him entering, in his scarlet coat
with gold buttons --from that day I have held the color in abhorrence.
M. Basile was a tall handsome man, of good address: he entered
with a consequential look and an air of taking his family unawares,
though none but friends were present. His wife ran to meet him,
threw her arms about his neck, and gave him a thousand caresses,
which he received with the utmost indifference; and without making
any return saluted the company and took his place at table. They
were just beginning to speak of his journey, when casting his eye on
the small table he asked in a sharp tone, what lad that was? Madam
Basile answered ingenuously. He then inquired whether I lodged in
the house; and was answered in the negative. "Why not?" replied he,
rudely, "since he stays here all day, he might as well remain all night
too." The monk now interfered, with a serious and true eulogium on
Madam Basile: in a few words he made mine also, adding, that so
far from blaming, he ought to further the pious charity of his wife,
since it was evident she had not passed the bounds of discretion.
The husband answered with an air of petulance, which (restrained by
the presence of the monk) he endeavored to stifle; it was, however,
sufficient to let me understand he had already received information
of me, and that our worthy clerk had rendered me an ill office.
We had hardly risen from table, when the latter came in triumph
from his employer, to inform me, I must leave the house that instant,
and never more during my life dare to set foot there. He took care to

aggravate this commission by everything that could render it cruel
and insulting. I departed without a word, my heart overwhelmed with
sorrow, less for being obliged to quit this amiable woman, than at the
thought of leaving her to the brutality of such a husband. He was
certainly right to wish her faithful; but though prudent and wellborn,
she was an Italian, that is to say, tender and vindictive; which made
me think, he was extremely imprudent in using means the most likely
in the world to draw on himself the very evil he so much dreaded.
Such was the success of my first adventure. I walked several
times up and down the street, wishing to get a sight of what my heart
incessantly regretted; but I could only discover her husband, or the
vigilant clerk, who, perceiving me, made a sign with the ell they used
in the shop, which was more expressive than alluring: finding,
therefore, that I was so completely watched, my courage failed, and I
went no more. I wished, at least, to find out the patron she had
provided me, but, unfortunately, I did not know his name. I ranged
several times round the convent, endeavoring in vain to meet with
him. At length, other events banished the delightful remembrance of
Madam Basile; and in a short time I so far forgot her, that I remained
as simple, as much a novice as ever, nor did my penchant for pretty
women even receive any sensible augmentation.
Her liberality had, however, increased my little wardrobe, though
she had done this with precaution and prudence, regarding neatness
more than decoration, and to make me comfortable rather than
brilliant. The coat I had brought from Geneva was yet wearable, she
only added a hat and some linen. I had no ruffles, nor would she give
me any, not but I felt a great inclination for them. She was satisfied
with having put it in my power to keep myself clean, though a charge
to do this was unnecessary while I was to appear before her.
A few days after this catastrophe; my hostess, who, as I have
already observed, was very friendly, with great satisfaction informed
me she had heard of a situation, and that a lady of rank desired to
see me. I immediately thought myself in the road to great
adventures; that being the point to which all my ideas tended: this,
however, did not prove so brilliant as I had conceived it. I waited on
the lady with the servant; who had mentioned me: she asked a
number of questions, and my answers not displeasing her, I

immediately entered into her service not, indeed, in the quality of
favorite, but as a footman. I was clothed like the rest of her people,
the only difference being, they wore a shoulder--knot, which I had
not, and, as there was no lace on her livery, it appeared merely a
tradesman's suit. This was the unforeseen conclusion of all my great
expectancies!
The Countess of Vercellis, with whom I now lived, was a widow
without children; her husband was a Piedmontese, but I always
believed her to be a Savoyard, as I could have no conception that a
native of Piedmont could speak such good French, and with so pure
an accent. She was a middle-aged woman, of a noble appearance
and cultivated understanding, being fond of French literature, in
which she was well versed. Her letters had the expression, and
almost the elegance of Madam de Savigne's; some of them might
have been taken for hers. My principal employ, which was by no
means displeasing to me, was to write from her dictating; a cancer in
the breast, from which she suffered extremely, not permitting her to
write herself.
Madam de Vercellis not only possessed a good understanding, but
a strong and elevated soul. I was with her during her last illness, and
saw her suffer and die, without showing an instant of weakness, or
the least effort of constraint; still retaining her feminine manners,
without entertaining an idea that such fortitude gave her any claim to
philosophy; a word which was not yet in fashion, nor comprehended
by her in the sense it is held at present. This strength of disposition
sometimes extended almost to apathy, ever appearing to feel as little
for others as herself; and when she relieved the unfortunate, it was
rather for the sake of acting right, than from a principle of real
commiseration. I have frequently experienced this insensibility, in
some measure, during the three months I remained with her. It would
have been natural to have had an esteem for a young man of some
abilities, who was incessantly under her observation, and that she
should think, as she felt her dissolution approaching, that after her
death he would have occasion for assistance and support: but
whether she judged me unworthy of particular attention, or that those
who narrowly watched all her motions, gave her no opportunity to
think of any but themselves, she did nothing for me.

I very well recollect that she showed some curiosity to know my
story, frequently questioning me, and appearing pleased when I
showed her the letters I wrote to Madam de Warrens, or explained
my sentiments; but as she never discovered her own, she certainly
did not take the right means to come at them. My heart, naturally
communicative, loved to display its feelings, whenever I encountered
a similar disposition; but dry, cold interrogatories, without any sign of
blame or approbation on my answers, gave me no confidence. Not
being able to determine whether my discourse was agreeable or
displeasing, I was ever in fear, and thought less of expressing my
ideas, than of being careful not to say anything that might seem to
my disadvantage. I have since remarked that this dry method of
questioning themselves into people's characters is a common trick
among women who pride themselves on superior understanding.
These imagine, that by concealing their own sentiments, they shall
the more easily penetrate into those of others; being ignorant that
this method destroys the confidence so necessary to make us reveal
them. A man, on being questioned, is immediately on his guard: and
if once he supposes that, without any interest in his concerns, you
only wish to set him a-talking, either he entertains you with lies, is
silent, or, examining every word before he utters it, rather chooses to
pass for a fool, than to be the dupe of your curiosity. In short, it is
ever a bad method to attempt to read the hearts of others by
endeavoring to conceal our own.
Madam de Vercellis never addressed a word to me which seemed
to express affection, pity, or benevolence. She interrogated me
coldly, and my answers were uttered with so much timidity, that she
doubtless entertained but a mean opinion of my intellects, for latterly
she never asked me any questions, nor said anything but what was
absolutely necessary for her service. She drew her judgment less
from what I really was, than from what she had made me, and by
considering me as a footman prevented my appearing otherwise.
I am inclined to think I suffered at that time by the same interested
game of concealed manoeuvre, which has counteracted me
throughout my life, and given me a very natural aversion for
everything that has the least appearance of it. Madam de Vercellis
having no children, her nephew, the Count de la Roque, was her

heir, and paid his court assiduously, as did her principal domestics,
who, seeing her end approaching, endeavored to take care of
themselves; in short, so many were busy about her, that she could
hardly have found time to think of me. At the head of her household
was a M. Lorenzy, an artful genius, with a still more artful wife; who
had so far insinuated herself into the good graces of her mistress,
that she was rather on the footing of a friend than a servant. She had
introduced a niece of hers as lady's maid: her name was
Mademoiselle Pontal; a cunning gypsy, that gave herself all the airs
of a waiting-woman, and assisted her aunt so well in besetting the
countess, that she only saw with their eyes, and acted through their
hands. I had not the happiness to please this worthy triumvirate; I
obeyed, but did not wait on them, not conceiving that my duty to our
general mistress required me to be a servant to her servants.
Besides this, I was a person that gave them some inquietude; they
saw I was not in my proper situation, and feared the countess would
discover it likewise, and by placing me in it, decrease their portions;
for such sort of people, too greedy to be just, look on every legacy
given to others as a diminution of their own wealth; they endeavored,
therefore, to keep me as much out of her sight as possible. She
loved to write letters, in her situation, but they contrived to give her a
distaste to it; persuading her, by the aid of the doctor, that it was too
fatiguing; and, under pretence that I did not understand how to wait
on her, they employed two great lubberly chairmen for that purpose;
in a word, they managed the affair so well, that for eight days before
she made her will, I had not been permitted to enter the chamber.
Afterwards I went in as usual, and was even more assiduous than
any one, being afflicted at the sufferings of the unhappy lady, whom I
truly respected and beloved for the calmness and fortitude with
which she bore her illness, and often did I shed tears of real sorrow
without being perceived by any one.
At length we lost her--I saw her expire. She had lived like a woman
of sense and virtue, her death was that of a philosopher. I can truly
say, she rendered the Catholic religion amiable to me by the serenity
with which she fulfilled its dictates, without any mixture of negligence
or affectation. She was naturally serious, but towards the end of her
illness she possessed a kind of gayety, too regular to be assumed,

which served as a counterpoise to the melancholy of her situation.
She only kept her bed two days, continuing to discourse cheerfully
with those about her to the very last.
She had bequeathed a year's wages to all the under servants, but,
not being on the household list, I had nothing: the Count de la
Roque, however, ordered me thirty livres, and the new coat I had on,
which M. Lorenzy would certainly have taken from me. He even
promised to procure me a place; giving me permission to wait on him
as often as I pleased. Accordingly, I went two or three times, without
being able to speak to him, and as I was easily repulsed, returned no
more; whether I did wrong will be seen hereafter.
Would I had finished what I have to say of my living at Madam de
Vercellis's. Though my situation apparently remained the same, I did
not leave her house as I had entered it: I carried with me the long
and painful remembrance of a crime; an insupportable weight of
remorse which yet hangs on my conscience, and whose bitter
recollection, far from weakening, during a period of forty years,
seems to gather strength as I grow old. Who would believe, that a
childish fault should be productive of such melancholy
consequences? But it is for the more than probable effects that my
heart cannot be consoled. I have, perhaps, caused an amiable,
honest, estimable girl, who surely merited a better fate than myself,
to perish with shame and misery.
Though it is very difficult to break up housekeeping without
confusion, and the loss of some property; yet such was the fidelity of
the domestics, and the vigilance of M. and Madam Lorenzy, that no
article of the inventory was found wanting; in short, nothing was
missing but a pink and silver ribbon, which had been worn, and
belonged to Mademoiselle Pontal. Though several things of more
value were in my reach, this ribbon alone tempted me, and
accordingly I stole it. As I took no great pains to conceal the bauble,
it was soon discovered; they immediately insisted on knowing from
whence I had taken it; this perplexed me--I hesitated, and at length
said, with confusion, that Marion gave it me.
Marion was a young Mauriennese, and had been cook to Madam
de Vercellis ever since she left off giving entertainments, for being
sensible she had more need of good broths than fine ragouts, she

had discharged her former one. Marion was not only pretty, but had
that freshness of color only to be found among the mountains, and,
above all, an air of modesty and sweetness, which made it
impossible to see her without affection; she was besides a good girl,
virtuous, and of such strict fidelity, that everyone was surprised at
hearing her named. They had not less confidence in me, and judged
it necessary to certify which of us was the thief. Marion was sent for;
a great number of people were present, among whom was the Count
de la Roque: she arrives; they show her the ribbon; I accuse her
boldly: she remains confused and speechless, casting a look on me
that would have disarmed a demon, but which my barbarous heart
resisted. At length, she denied it with firmness, but without anger,
exhorting me to return to myself, and not injure an innocent girl who
had never wronged me. With infernal impudence, I confirmed my
accusation, and to her face maintained she had given me the ribbon:
on which, the poor girl, bursting into tears, said these words--"Ah,
Rousseau! I thought you a good disposition--you render me very
unhappy, but I would not be in your situation." She continued to
defend herself with as much innocence as firmness, but without
uttering the least invective against me. Her moderation, compared to
my positive tone, did her an injury; as it did not appear natural to
suppose, on one side such diabolical assurance; on the other, such
angelic mildness. The affair could not be absolutely decided, but the
presumption was in my favor; and the Count de la Roque, in sending
us both away, contented himself with saying, "The conscience of the
guilty would revenge the innocent." His prediction was true, and is
being daily verified.
I am ignorant what became of the victim of my calumny, but there
is little probability of her having been able to place herself agreeably
after this, as she labored under an imputation cruel to her character
in every respect. The theft was a trifle, yet it was a theft, and, what
was worse, employed to seduce a boy; while the lie and obstinacy
left nothing to hope from a person in whom so many vices were
united. I do not even look on the misery and disgrace in which I
plunged her as the greatest evil: who knows, at her age, whither
contempt and disregarded innocence might have led her?--Alas! if
remorse for having made her unhappy is insupportable, what must I

have suffered at the thought of rendering her even worse than
myself. The cruel remembrance of this transaction, sometimes so
troubles and disorders me, that, in my disturbed slumbers, I imagine
I see this poor girl enter and reproach me with my crime, as though I
had committed it but yesterday. While in easy tranquil
circumstances, I was less miserable on this account, but, during a
troubled agitated life, it has robbed me of the sweet consolation of
persecuted innocence, and made me wofully experience, what, I
think, I have remarked in some of my works, that remorse sleeps in
the calm sunshine of prosperity, but wakes amid the storms of
adversity. I could never take on me to discharge my heart of this
weight in the bosom of a friend; nor could the closest intimacy ever
encourage me to it, even with Madam de Warrens: all I could do,
was to own I had to accuse myself of an atrocious crime, but never
said in what it consisted. The weight, therefore, has remained heavy
on my conscience to this day; and I can truly own the desire of
relieving myself, in some measure, from it, contributed greatly to the
resolution of writing my Confessions.
I have proceeded truly in that I have just made, and it will certainly
be thought I have not sought to palliate the turpitude of my offence;
but I should not fulfill the purpose of this undertaking, did I not, at the
same time, divulge my interior disposition, and excuse myself as far
as is conformable with truth.
Never was wickedness further from my thoughts, than in that cruel
moment; and when I accused the unhappy girl, it is strange, but
strictly true, that my friendship for her was the immediate cause of it.
She was present to my thoughts; I formed my excuse from the first
object that presented itself: I accused her with doing what I meant to
have done, and as I designed to have given her the ribbon, asserted
she had given it to me. When she appeared, my heart was agonized,
but the presence of so many people was more powerful than my
compunction. I did not fear punishment, but I dreaded shame: I
dreaded it more than death, more than the crime, more than all the
world. I would have buried, hid myself in the centre of the earth:
invincible shame bore down every other sentiment; shame alone
caused all my impudence, and in proportion as I became criminal,
the fear of discovery rendered me intrepid. I felt no dread but that of

being detected, of being publicly, and to my face, declared a thief,
liar, and calumniator; an unconquerable fear of this overcame every
other sensation. Had I been left to myself, I should infallibly have
declared the truth. Or if M. de la Rogue had taken me aside, and
said--"Do not injure this poor girl; if you are guilty own it,"--I am
convinced I should instantly have thrown myself at his feet; but they
intimidated, instead of encouraging me. I was hardly out of my
childhood, or rather, was yet in it. It is also just to make some
allowance for my age. In youth, dark, premeditated villainy is more
criminal than in a riper age, but weaknesses are much less so; my
fault was truly nothing more; and I am less afflicted at the deed itself
than for its consequences. It had one good effect, however, in
preserving me through the rest of my life from any criminal action,
from the terrible impression that has remained from the only one I
ever committed; and I think my aversion for lying proceeds in a great
measure from regret at having been guilty of so black a one. If it is a
crime that can be expiated, as I dare believe, forty years of
uprightness and honor on various difficult occasions, with the many
misfortunes that have overwhelmed my latter years, may have
completed it. Poor Marion has found so many avengers in this world,
that however great my offence towards her, I do not fear to bear the
guilt with me. Thus have I disclosed what I had to say on this painful
subject; may I be permitted never to mention it again.

Leaving the service of Madam de Vercellis nearly as I had entered it,
I returned to my former hostess, and remained there five or six
weeks; during which time health, youth, and laziness, frequently
rendered my temperament importunate. I was restless, absent, and
thoughtful: I wept and sighed for a happiness I had no idea of,
though at the same time highly sensible of some deficiency. This
situation is indescribable, few men can even form any conception of
it, because, in general, they have prevented that plenitude of life, at
once tormenting and delicious. My thoughts were incessantly
occupied with girls and women, but in a manner peculiar to myself:
these ideas kept my senses in a perpetual and disagreeable activity,
though, fortunately, they did not point out the means of deliverance. I
would have given my life to have met with a Miss Goton, but the time
was past in which the play of infancy predominated; increase of
years had introduced shame, the inseparable companion of a
conscious deviation from rectitude, which so confirmed my natural
timidity as to render it invincible; and never, either at that time or
since, could I prevail on myself to offer a proposition favorable to my
wishes (unless in a manner constrained to it by previous advances)
even with those whose scruples I had no cause to dread.
My stay at Madam de Vercellis's had procured me some
acquaintance, which I thought might be serviceable to me, and
therefore wished to retain. Among others, I sometimes visited a
Savoyard abbe, M. Gaime, who was tutor to the Count of Melarede's
children. He was young, and not much known, but possessed an
excellent cultivated understanding, with great probity, and was,
altogether, one of the best men I ever knew. He was incapable of

doing me the service I then stood most in need of, not having
sufficient interest to procure me a situation, but from him I reaped
advantages far more precious, which have been useful to me
through life, lessons of pure morality, and maxims of sound
judgment.
In the successive order of my inclinations and ideas, I had ever
been too high or too low. Achilles or Thersites; sometimes a hero, at
others a villain. M. Gaime took pains to make me properly
acquainted with myself, without sparing or giving me too much
discouragement. He spoke in advantageous terms of my disposition
and talents, adding, that he foresaw obstacles which would prevent
my profiting by them; thus, according to him, they were to serve less
as steps by which I should mount to fortune, than as resources
which might enable me to exist without one. He gave me a true
picture of human life, of which, hitherto, I had formed but a very
erroneous idea, teaching me, that a man of understanding, though
destined to experience adverse fortune, might, by skilful
management, arrive at happiness; that there was no true felicity
without virtue, which was practicable in every situation. He greatly
diminished my admiration of grandeur, by proving that those in a
superior situation are neither better nor happier than those they
command. One of his maxims has frequently returned to my
memory: it was, that if we could truly read the hearts of others we
should feel more inclination to descend than rise: this reflection, the
truth of which is striking without extravagance, I have found of great
utility, in the various exigences of my life, as it tended to make me
satisfied with my condition. He gave me the first just conception of
relative duties, which my high-flown imagination had ever pictured in
extremes, making me sensible that the enthusiasm of sublime
virtues is of little use in society; that while endeavoring to rise too
high we are in danger of falling; and that a virtuous and uniform
discharge of little duties requires as great a degree of fortitude as
actions which are called heroic, and would at the same time procure
more honor and happiness. That it was infinitely more desirable to
possess the lasting esteem of those about us, than at intervals to
attract admiration.

In properly arranging the various duties between man and man, it
was necessary to ascend to principles; the step I had recently taken,
and of which my present situation was the consequence, naturally
led us to speak of religion. It will easily be conceived that the honest
M. Gaime was, in a great measure, the original of the Savoyard
Vicar; prudence only obliging him to deliver his sentiments, on
certain points, with more caution and reserve, and explain himself
with less freedom; but his sentiments and councils were the same,
not even excepting his advice to return to my country; all was
precisely as I have since given it to the pubic. Dwelling no longer,
therefore, on conversations which everyone may see the substance
of, I shall only add, that these wise instructions (though they did not
produce an immediate effect) were as so many seeds of virtue and
religion in my heart which were never rooted out, and only required
the fostering cares of friendship to bring to maturity.
Though my conversation was not very sincere, I was affected by
his discourses, and far from being weary, was pleased with them on
account of their clearness and simplicity, but above all because his
heart seemed interested in what he said. My disposition is naturally
tender, I have ever been less attached to people for the good they
have really done me than for that they designed to do, and my
feelings in this particular have seldom misled me: thus I truly
esteemed M. Gaime. I was in a manner his second disciple, which
even at that time was of inestimable service in turning me from a
propensity to vice into which my idleness was leading me.
One day, when I least expected it, I was sent for by the Count de
la Roque. Having frequently called at his house, without being able
to speak with him, I grew weary, and supposing he had either forgot
me or retained some unfavorable impression of me, returned no
more: but I was mistaken in both these conjectures. He had more
than once witnessed the pleasure I took in fulfilling my duty to his
aunt: he had even mentioned it to her, and afterwards spoke of it,
when I no longer thought of it myself.
He received me graciously, saying that instead of amusing me with
useless promises, he had sought to place me to advantage; that he
had succeeded, and would put me in a way to better my situation,
but the rest must depend on myself. That the family into which he

should introduce me being both powerful and esteemed, I should
need no other patrons; and though at first on the footing of a servant,
I might be assured, that if my conduct and sentiments were found
above that station, I should not long remain in it. The end of this
discourse cruelly disappointed the brilliant hopes the beginning had
inspired. "What! forever a footman?" said I to myself, with a
bitterness which confidence presently effaced, for I felt myself too
superior to that situation to fear long remaining there.
He took me to the Count de Gauvon, Master of the Horse to the
Queen, and Chief of the illustrious House of Solar. The air of dignity
conspicuous in this respectable old man, rendered the affability with
which he received me yet more interesting. He questioned me with
evident interest, and I replied with sincerity. He then told the Count
de la Roque, that my features were agreeable, and promised
intellect, which he believed I was not deficient in; but that was not
enough, and time must show the rest; after which, turning to me, he
said, "Child, almost all situations are attended with difficulties in the
beginning; yours, however, shall not have too great a portion of
them; be prudent, and endeavor to please everyone, that will be
almost your only employment; for the rest fear nothing, you shall be
taken care of." Immediately after he went to the Marchioness de
Breil, his daughter-in-law, to whom he presented me, and then to the
Abbe de Gauvon, his son. I was elated with this beginning, as I knew
enough of the world already to conclude, that so much ceremony is
not generally used at the reception of a footman. In fact, I was not
treated like one. I dined at the steward's table; did not wear a livery;
and the Count de Favria (a giddy youth) having commanded me to
get behind his coach, his grandfather ordered that I should get
behind no coach, nor follow any one out of the house. Meantime, I
waited at table, and did, within doors, the business of a footman; but
I did it, as it were, of my own free will, without being appointed to any
particular service; and except writing some letters, which were
dictated to me, and cutting out some ornaments for the Count de
Favria, I was almost the absolute master of my time. This trial of my
discretion, which I did not then perceive, was certainly very
dangerous, and not very humane; for in this state of idleness I might
have contracted vices which I should not otherwise have given into.

Fortunately, it did not produce that effect; my memory retained the
lessons of M. Gaime, they had made an impression on my heart,
and I sometimes escaped from the house of my patron to obtain a
repetition of them. I believe those who saw me going out, apparently
by stealth, had no conception of my business. Nothing could be
more prudent than the advice he gave me respecting my conduct.
My beginning was admirable; so much attention, assiduity, and zeal,
had charmed everyone. The Abby Gaime advised me to moderate
this first ardor, lest I should relax, and that relaxation should be
considered as neglect. "Your setting out," said he, "is the rule of what
will be expected of you; endeavor gradually to increase your
attentions, but be cautious how you diminish them."
As they paid but little attention to my trifling talents, and supposed
I possessed no more than nature had given me, there was no
appearance (notwithstanding the promises of Count de Gauvon) of
my meeting with any particular consideration. Some objects of more
consequence had intervened. The Marquis de Breil, son of the Count
de Gauvon, was then ambassador at Vienna; some circumstances
had occurred at that court which for some weeks kept the family in
continual agitation, and left them no time to think of me. Meantime I
had relaxed but little in my attentions, though one object in the family
did me both good and harm, making me more secure from exterior
dissipation, but less attentive to my duty.
Mademoiselle de Breil was about my own age, tolerably
handsome, and very fair complexioned, with black hair, which
notwithstanding, gave her features that air of softness so natural to
the flaxen, and which my heart could never resist. The court dress,
so favorable to youth, showed her fine neck and shape to
advantage, and the mourning, which was then worn, seemed to add
to her beauty. It will be said, a domestic should not take notice of
these things; I was certainly to blame, yet I perceived all this, nor
was I the only one; the maitre d' hotel and valet de chambre spoke of
her sometimes at table with a vulgarity that pained me extremely. My
head, however, was not sufficiently turned to allow of my being
entirely in love; I did not forget myself, or my situation. I loved to see
Mademoiselle de Breil; to hear her utter anything that marked wit,
sense, or good humor: my ambition, confined to a desire of waiting

on her, never exceeded its just rights. At table I was ever attentive to
make the most of them; if her footman quitted her chair, I instantly
supplied his place; in default of this, I stood facing her, seeking in her
eyes what she was about to ask for, and watching the moment to
change her plate. What would I not have given to hear her
command, to have her look at, or speak the smallest word to me! but
no, I had the mortification to be beneath her regard; she did not even
perceive I was there. Her brother, who frequently spoke to me while
at table, having one day said something which I did not consider
obliging, I made him so arch and well-turned an answer, that it drew
her attention; she cast her eyes upon me, and this glance was
sufficient to fill me with transport. The next day, a second occasion
presented itself, which I fortunately made use of. A great dinner was
given; and I saw, with astonishment, for the first time, the maitre d'
hotel waiting at table, with a sword by his side, and hat on his head.
By chance, the discourse turned on the motto of the house of Solar,
which was, with the arms, worked in the tapestry: 'Tel fiert qui ne fue
pas'. As the Piedmontese are not in general very perfect in the
French language, they found fault with the orthography, saying, that
in the word fiert there should be no 't'. The old Count de Gauvon was
going to reply, when happening to cast his eyes on me, he perceived
I smiled without daring to say anything; he immediately ordered me
to speak my opinion. I then said, I did not think the 't' superfluous,
'fiert' being an old French word, not derived from the noun 'ferus',
proud, threatening; but from the verb 'ferit', he strikes, he wounds;
the motto, therefore, did not appear to mean, some threat, but,
'Some strike who do not kill'. The whole company fixed their eyes on
me, then on each other, without speaking a word; never was a
greater degree of astonishment; but what most flattered me, was an
air of satisfaction which I perceived on the countenance of
Mademoiselle de Breil. This scornful lady deigned to cast on me a
second look at least as valuable as the former, and turning to her
grandfather, appeared to wait with impatience for the praise that was
due to me, and which he fully bestowed, with such apparent
satisfaction, that it was eagerly chorused by the whole table. This
interval was short, but delightful in many respects; it was one of
those moments so rarely met with, which place things in their natural

order, and revenge depressed merit for the injuries of fortune. Some
minutes after Mademoiselle de Breil again raised her eyes, desiring
me with a voice of timid affability to give her some drink. It will easily
be supposed I did not let her wait, but advancing towards her, I was
seized with such a trembling, that having filled the glass too full, I
spilled some of the water on her plate, and even on herself. Her
brother asked me, giddily, why I trembled thus? This question
increased my confusion, while the face of Mademoiselle de Breil was
suffused with a crimson blush.
Here ended the romance; where it may be remarked (as with
Madam Basile, and others in the continuation of my life) that I was
not fortunate in the conclusion of my amours. In vain I placed myself
in the antechamber of Madam de Breil, I could not obtain one mark
of attention from her daughter; she went in and out without looking at
me, nor had I the confidence to raise my eyes to her; I was even so
foolishly stupid, that one day, on dropping her glove as she passed,
instead of seizing and covering it with kisses, as I would gladly have
done, I did not dare to quit my place, but suffered it to be taken up by
a great booby of a footman, whom I could willingly have knocked
down for his officiousness. To complete my timidity, I perceived I had
not the good fortune to please Madam de Breil; she not only never
ordered, but even rejected, my services; and having twice found me
in her antechamber, asked me, dryly, "If I had nothing to do?" I was
obliged, therefore, to renounce this dear antechamber; at first it
caused me some uneasiness, but other things intervening, I
presently thought no more of it.
The disdain of Madam de Breil was fully compensated by the
kindness of her father-in-law, who at length began to think of me.
The evening after the entertainment, I have already mentioned, he
had a conversation with me that lasted half an hour, which appeared
to satisfy him, and absolutely enchanted me. This good man had
less sense than Madam de Vercellis, but possessed more feeling; I
therefore succeeded much better with him. He bade me attach
myself to his son, the Abbe Gauvon, who had an esteem for me,
which, if I took care to cultivate, might be serviceable in furnishing
me with what was necessary to complete their views for my future
establishment. The next morning I flew to M. the Abbe, who did not

receive me as a servant, but made me sit by his fireside, and
questioned me with great affability. He soon found that my
education, which had attempted many things, had completed none;
but observing that I understood something of Latin, he undertook to
teach me more, and appointed me to attend him every morning.
Thus, by one of the whimsicalities which have marked the whole
course of my life, at once above and below my natural situation, I
was pupil and footman in the same house: and though in servitude,
had a preceptor whose birth entitled him to supply that place only to
the children of kings.
The Abbe de Gauvon was a younger son, and designed by his
family for a bishopric, for which reason his studies had been
pursued, further than is usual with people of quality. He had been
sent to the university of Sienna, where he had resided some years,
and from whence he had brought a good portion of cruscantism,
designing to be that at Turin which the Abbe de Dangeau was
formerly at Paris. Being disgusted with theology, he gave in to the
belle-lettres, which is very frequent in Italy, with those who have
entered the career of prelacy. He had studied the poets, and wrote
tolerable Latin and Italian verses; in a word, his taste was calculated
to form mine, and give some order to that chaos of insignificant trash
with which my brain was encumbered; but whether my prating had
misled him, or that he could not support the trouble of teaching the
elementary parts of Latin, he put me at first too high; and I had
scarcely translated a few fables of Phoedrus before he put me into
Virgil, where I could hardly understand anything. It will be seen
hereafter that I was destined frequently to learn Latin, but never to
attain it. I labored with assiduity, and the abbe bestowed his attention
with a degree of kindness, the remembrance of which, even at this
time, both interests and softens me. I passed the greater part of the
morning with him as much for my own instruction as his service; not
that he ever permitted me to perform any menial office, but to copy,
or write from his dictating; and my employment of secretary was
more useful than that of scholar, and by this means I not only
learned the Italian in its utmost purity, but also acquired a taste for
literature, and some discernment of composition, which could not

have been at La Tribu's, and which was useful to me when I
afterwards wrote alone.
At this period of my life, without being romantic, I might reasonably
have indulged the hope of preferment. The abbe, thoroughly pleased
with me, expressed his satisfaction to everyone, while his father had
such a singular affection for me, that I was assured by the Count de
Favria, that he had spoken of me to the king; even Madam de Breil
had laid aside her disdainful looks; in short I was a general favorite,
which gave great jealousy to the other servants, who seeing me
honored by the instructions of their master's son, were persuaded I
should not remain their equal.
As far as I could judge by some words dropped at random, and
which I reflected on afterwards, it appeared to me, that the House of
Solar, wishing to run the career of embassies, and hoping perhaps in
time to arrive at the ministry, wished to provide themselves with a
person of merit and talents, who depending entirely on them, might
obtain their confidence, and be of essential service. This project of
the Count de Gauvon was judicious, magnanimous, and truly worthy
of a powerful nobleman, equally provident and generous; but
besides my not seeing, at that time, its full extent, it was far too
rational for my brain, and required too much confinement.
My ridiculous ambition sought for fortune in the midst of brilliant
adventures, and not finding one woman in all this scheme, it
appeared tedious, painful and melancholy; though I should rather
have thought it more honorable on this account, as the species of
merit generally patronized by women is certainly less worthy that I
was supposed to possess.
Everything succeeded to my wish: I had obtained, almost forced,
the esteem of all; the trial was over, and I was universally considered
as a young man with flattering prospects, who was not at present in
his proper sphere, but was expected soon to reach it; but my place
was not assigned me by man, and I was to reach it by very difficult
paths. I now come to one of those characteristic traits, which are so
natural to me, and which, indeed, the reader might have observed
without this reflection.
There were at Turin several new converts of my own stamp, whom
I neither liked nor wish to see; but I had met with some Genevese

who were not of this description, and among others a M. Mussard,
nicknamed Wryneck, a miniature painter, and a distant relation. This
M. Mussard, having learned my situation at the Count de Gauvon's,
came to see me, with another Genevese, named Bacle, who had
been my comrade during my apprenticeship. This Bacle was a very
sprightly, amusing young fellow, full of lively sallies, which at his time
of life appeared extremely agreeable. At once, then, behold me
delighted with M. Bacle; charmed to such a degree that I found it
impossible to quit him. He was shortly to depart for Geneva; what a
loss had I to sustain! I felt the whole force of it, and resolving to
make the best use of this precious interval, I determined not to leave
him, or, rather, he never quitted me, for my head was not yet
sufficiently turned to think of quitting the house without leave, but it
was soon perceived that he engrossed my whole time, and he was
accordingly forbid the house. This so incensed me, that forgetting
everything but my friend Bacle, I went neither to the abbe nor the
count, and was no longer to be found at home. I paid no attention to
repeated reprimands, and at length was threatened with dismissal.
This threat was my ruin, as it suggested the idea that it was not
absolutely necessary that Bacle should depart alone. From that
moment I could think of no other pleasure, no other situation or
happiness than taking this journey. To render the felicity still more
complete, at the end of it (though at an immense distance) I pictured
to myself Madam de Warrens; for as to returning to Geneva, it never
entered into my imagination. The hills, fields, brooks and villages,
incessantly succeeded each other with new charms, and this
delightful jaunt seemed worthy to absorb my whole existence.
Memory recalled, with inexpressible pleasure, how charming the
country had appeared in coming to Turin; what then must it be,
when, to the pleasure of independence, should be added the
company of a good-humored comrade of my own age and
disposition, without any constraint or obligation, but free to go or stay
as we pleased? Would it not be madness to sacrifice the prospect of
so much felicity to projects of ambition, slow and difficult in their
execution, and uncertain in their event? But even supposing them
realized, and in their utmost splendor, they were not worth one
quarter of an hour of the sweet pleasure and liberty of youth.

Full of these wise conclusions, I conducted myself so improperly,
that (not indeed without some trouble) I got myself dismissed; for on
my return one night the maitre de hotel gave me warning on the part
of the count. This was exactly what I wanted; for feeling, spite of
myself, the extravagance of my conduct, I wished to excuse it by the
addition of injustice and ingratitude, by throwing the blame on others,
and sheltering myself under the idea of necessity.
I was told the Count de Favria wished to speak with me the next
morning before my departure; but, being sensible that my head was
so far turned as to render it possible for me to disobey the injunction,
the maitre de hotel declined paying the money designed me, and
which certainly I had very ill earned, till after this visit; for my kind
patrons being unwilling to place me in the situation of a footman, I
had not any fixed wages.
The Count de Favria, though young and giddy, talked to me on this
occasion in the most sensible and serious manner: I might add, if it
would not be thought vain, with the utmost tenderness. He reminded
me, in the most flattering terms, of the cares of his uncle, and
intentions of his grandfather; after having drawn in lively colors what
I was sacrificing to ruin, he offered to make my peace, without
stipulating any conditions, but that I should no more see the
worthless fellow who had seduced me.
It was so apparent that he did not say all this of himself, that
notwithstanding my blind stupidity, I powerfully felt the kindness of
my good old master, but the dear journey was too firmly printed on
my imagination for any consideration to balance the charm. Bereft of
understanding, firm to my purpose, I hardened myself against
conviction, and arrogantly answered, that as they had thought fit to
give me warning, I had resolved to take it, and conceived it was now
too late to retract, since, whatever might happen to me, I was fully
resolved not to be driven a second time from the same house. The
count, justly irritated, bestowed on me some names which I
deserved, and putting me out of his apartment by the shoulders, shut
the door on me. I departed triumphant, as if I had gained the greatest
victory, and fearful of sustaining a second combat even had the
ingratitude to leave the house without thanking the abbe for his
kindness.

To form a just conception of my delirium at that moment, the
excess to which my heart is subject to be heated by the most trifling
incidents, and the ardor with which my imagination seizes on the
most attractive objects should be conceived. At these times, plans
the most ridiculous, childish, and void of sense, flatter my favorite
idea, and persuade me that it is reasonable to sacrifice everything to
the possession of it. Would it be believed, that when near nineteen,
any one could be so stupid as to build his hopes of future
subsistence on an empty phial? For example:
The Abbe de Gauvon had made me a present, some weeks
before, of a very pretty heron fountain, with which I was highly
delighted. Playing with this toy, and speaking of our departure, the
sage Bacle and myself thought it might be of infinite advantage, and
enable us to lengthen our journey. What in the world was so curious
as a heron fountain? This idea was the foundation on which we built
our future fortune: we were to assemble the country people in every
village we might pass through, and delight them with the sight of it,
when feasting and good cheer would be sure to pour on us
abundantly; for we were both firmly persuaded, that provisions could
cost nothing to those who grew and gathered them, and if they did
not stuff travellers, it was downright ill-nature.
We pictured in all parts entertainments and weddings, reckoning
that without any expense but wind from our lungs, and the water of
our fountain, we should be maintained through Piedmont, Savoy,
France, and indeed, all the world over. There was no end to our
projected travels, and we immediately directed our course
northward, rather for the pleasure of crossing the Alps, than from a
supposed necessity of being obliged to stop at any place.
Such was the plan on which I set out, abandoning without regret,
my preceptors, studies, and hopes, with the almost certain
attainment of a fortune, to lead the life of a real vagabond. Farewell
to the capital; adieu to the court, ambition, love, the fair, and all the
great adventures into which hope had led me during the preceding
year! I departed with my fountain and my friend Bacle, a purse lightly
furnished, but a heart over-flowing with pleasure, and only thinking
how to enjoy the extensive felicity which I supposed my project
encircled.

This extravagant journey was performed almost as agreeably as I
had expected, though not exactly on the same plan; not but our
fountain highly amused the hostess and servants for some minutes
at all the ale-houses where we halted, yet we found it equally
necessary to pay on our departure; but that gave us no concern, as
we never thought of depending on it entirely until our money should
be expended. An accident spared us that trouble, our fountain was
broken near Bramant, and in good time, for we both felt (though
without daring to own it to each other) that we began to be weary of
it. This misfortune rendered us gayer than ever; we laughed heartily
at our giddiness in having forgotten that our clothes and shoes would
wear out, or trusting to renew them by the play of our fountain. We
continued our journey as merrily as we had begun it, only drawing
faster towards that termination where our drained purses made it
necessary for us to arrive.
At Chambery I became pensive; not for the folly I had committed,
for never did any one think less of the past, but on account of the
reception I should meet with from Madam de Warrens; for I looked
on her house as my paternal home. I had written her an account of
my reception at the Count de Gauvon's; she knew my expectancies,
and, in congratulating me on my good fortune, had added some wise
lessons on the return I ought to make for the kindness with which
they treated me. She looked on my fortune as already made, if not
destroyed by my own negligence; what then would she say on my
arrival? for it never entered my mind that she might shut the door
against me, but I dreaded the uneasiness I might give her; I dreaded
her reproaches, to me more wounding than want; I resolved to bear
all in silence, and, if possible to appease her. I now saw nothing but
Madam de Warrens in the whole universe, and to live in disgrace
with her was impossible.
I was most concerned about my companion, whom I did not wish
to offend, and feared I should not easily get rid of. I prefaced this
separation by an affected coldness during the last day's journey. The
drole understood me perfectly; in fact, he was rather giddy than
deficient in point of sense--I expected he would have been hurt at my
inconstancy, but I was quite mistaken; nothing affected my friend
Bacle, for hardly had we set foot in town, on our arrival in Annecy,

before he said, "You are now at home,"--embraced--bade me adieu-turned on his heel, and disappeared; nor have I ever heard of him
since.
How did my heart beat as I approached the habitation of Madam
de Warrens! my legs trembled under me, my eyes were clouded with
a mist, I neither saw, heard, nor recollected any one, and was
obliged frequently to stop that I might draw breath, and recall my
bewildered senses. Was it fear of not obtaining that succor I stood in
need of, which agitated me to this degree? At the age I then was,
does the fear of perishing with hunger give such alarms? No: I
declare with as much truth as pride, that it was not in the power of
interest or indigence, at any period of my life, to expand or contract
my heart. In the course of a painful life, memorable for its
vicissitudes, frequently destitute of an asylum, and without bread, I
have contemplated, with equal indifference, both opulence and
misery. In want I might have begged or stolen, as others have done,
but never could feel distress at being reduced to such necessities.
Few men have grieved more than myself, few have shed so many
tears; yet never did poverty, or the fear of falling into it, make me
heave a sigh or moisten my eyelids. My soul, in despite of fortune,
has only been sensible of real good and evil, which did not depend
on her; and frequently, when in possession of everything that could
make life pleasing, I have been the most miserable of mortals.
The first glance of Madam de Warrens banished all my fears--my
heart leaped at the sound of her voice; I threw myself at her feet, and
in transports of the most lively joy, pressed my lips upon her hand. I
am ignorant whether she had received any recent information of me.
I discovered but little surprise on her countenance, and no sorrow.
"Poor child!" said she, in an affectionate tone, "art thou here again? I
knew you were too young for this journey; I am very glad, however,
that it did not turn out so bad as I apprehended." She then made me
recount my history; it was not long, and I did it faithfully: suppressing
only some trifling circumstances, but on the whole neither sparing
nor excusing myself.
The question was, where I could lodge: she consulted her maid on
this point--I hardly dared to breathe during the deliberation; but when
I heard I was to sleep in the house, I could scarce contain my joy;

and saw the little bundle I brought with me carried into my destined
apartment with much the same sensations as St. Preux saw his
chaise put up at Madam de Wolmar's. To complete all, I had the
satisfaction to find that this favor was not to be transitory; for at a
moment when they thought me attentive to something else, I heard
Madam de Warrens say, "They may talk as they please, but since
Providence has sent him back, I am determined not to abandon
him."
Behold me, then, established at her house; not, however, that I
date the happiest days of my life from this period, but this served to
prepare me for them. Though that sensibility of heart, which enables
us truly to enjoy our being, is the work of Nature, and perhaps a
mere effect of organization, yet it requires situations to unfold itself,
and without a certain concurrence of favorable circumstances, a man
born with the most acute sensibility may go out of the world without
ever having been acquainted with his own temperament. This was
my case till that time, and such perhaps it might have remained had I
never known Madam de Warrens, or even having known her, had I
not remained with her long enough to contract that pleasing habit of
affectionate sentiments with which she inspired me. I dare affirm,
that those who only love, do not feel the most charming sensations
we are capable of: I am acquainted with another sentiment, less
impetuous, but a thousand times more delightful; sometimes joined
with love, but frequently separated from it. This feeling is not simply
friendship; it is more enchanting, more tender; nor do I imagine it can
exist between persons of the same sex; at least I have been truly a
friend, if ever a man was, and yet never experienced it in that kind.
This distinction is not sufficiently clear, but will become so hereafter:
sentiments are only distinguishable by their effects.
Madam de Warrens inhabited an old house, but large enough to
have a handsome spare apartment, which she made her drawingroom. I now occupied this chamber, which was in the passage I have
before mentioned as the place of our first meeting. Beyond the brook
and gardens was a prospect of the country, which was by no means
uninteresting to the young inhabitant, being the first time, since my
residence at Bossey, that I had seen anything before my windows
but walls, roofs, or the dirty street. How pleasing then was this

novelty! it helped to increase the tenderness of my disposition, for I
looked on this charming landscape as the gift of my dear patroness,
who I could almost fancy had placed it there on purpose for me.
Peaceably seated, my eyes pursued her amidst the flowers and the
verdure; her charms seemed to me confounded with those of the
spring; my heart, till now contracted, here found means to expand
itself, and my sighs exhaled freely in this charming retreat.
The magnificence I had been accustomed to at Turin was not to be
found at Madam de Warrens, but in lieu of it there was neatness,
regularity, and a patriarchal abundance, which is seldom attached to
pompous ostentation. She had very little plate, no china, no game in
her kitchen, or foreign wines in her cellar, but both were well
furnished, and at every one's service; and her coffee, though served
in earthenware cups, was excellent. Whoever came to her house
was invited to dine there, and never did laborer, messenger, or
traveller, depart without refreshment. Her family consisted of a pretty
chambermaid from Fribourg, named Merceret; a valet from her own
country called Claude Anet (of whom I shall speak hereafter), a
cook, and two hired chairmen when she visited, which seldom
happened. This was a great deal to be done out of two thousand
livres a year; yet, with good management, it might have been
sufficient in a country where land is extremely good, and money very
scarce. Unfortunately, economy was never her favorite virtue; she
contracted debts--paid them--thus her money passed from hand to
hand like a weaver's shuttle, and quickly disappeared.
The arrangement of her housekeeping was exactly what I should
have chosen, and I shared it with satisfaction. I was least pleased
with the necessity of remaining too long at table. Madam de Warrens
was so much incommoded with the first smell of soup or meat, as
almost to occasion fainting; from this she slowly recovered, talking
meantime, and never attempting to eat for the first half hour. I could
have dined thrice in the time, and had ever finished my meal long
before she began; I then ate again for company; and though by this
means I usually dined twice, felt no inconvenience from it. In short, I
was perfectly at my ease, and the happier as my situation required
no care. Not being at this time instructed in the state of her finances,
I supposed her means were adequate to her expense; and though I

afterwards found the same abundance, yet when instructed in her
real situation, finding her pension ever anticipated, prevented me
from enjoying the same tranquility. Foresight with me has always
embittered enjoyment; in vain I saw the approach of misfortunes, I
was never the more likely to avoid them.
From the first moment of our meeting, the softest familiarity was
established between us: and in the same degree it continued during
the rest of her life. Child was my name, Mamma was hers, and child
and mamma we have ever continued, even after a number of years
had almost effaced the apparent difference of age between us. I
think those names convey an exact idea of our behavior, the
simplicity of our manners, and above all, the similarity of our
dispositions. To me she was the tenderest of mothers, ever
preferring my welfare to her own pleasure; and if my own satisfaction
found some interest in my attachment to her, it was not to change its
nature, but only to render it more exquisite, and infatuate me with the
charm of having a mother young and handsome, whom I was
delighted to caress: I say literally, to caress, for never did it enter into
her imagination to deny me the tenderest maternal kisses and
endearments, or into my heart to abuse them. It will be said, at
length our connection was of a different kind: I confess it; but have
patience, that will come in its turn.
The sudden sight of her, on our first interview, was the only truly
passionate moment she ever inspired me with; and even that was
principally the work of surprise. With her I had neither transports nor
desires, but remained in a ravishing calm, sensible of a happiness I
could not define, and thus could I have passed my whole life, or
even eternity, without feeling an instant of uneasiness.
She was the only person with whom I never experienced that want
of conversation, which to me is so painful to endure. Our tete-a-tetes
were rather an inexhaustible chat than conversation, which could
only conclude from interruption. So far from finding discourse
difficult, I rather thought it a hardship to be silent; unless, when
contemplating her projects, she sunk into a reverie; when I silently let
her meditate, and gazing on her, was the happiest of men. I had
another singular fancy, which was that without pretending to the
favor of a tete-a-tete, I was perpetually seeking occasion to form

them, enjoying such opportunities with rapture; and when
importunate visitors broke in upon us, no matter whether it was man
or woman, I went out murmuring, not being able to remain a
secondary object in her company; then, counting the minutes in her
antechamber, I used to curse these eternal visitors, thinking it
inconceivable how they could find so much to say, because I had still
more.
If ever I felt the full force of my attachment, it was when I did not
see her. When in her presence, I was only content; when absent, my
uneasiness reached almost to melancholy, and a wish to live with
her gave me emotions of tenderness even to tears. Never shall I
forget one great holiday, while she was at vespers, when I took a
walk out of the city, my heart full of her image, and the ardent wish to
pass my life with her. I could easily enough see that at present this
was impossible; that the happiness I enjoyed would be of short
duration, and this idea gave to my contemplations a tincture of
melancholy, which, however, was not gloomy, but tempered with a
flattering hope. The ringing of bells, which ever particularly affects
me, the singing of birds, the fineness of the day, the beauty of the
landscape, the scattered country houses, among which in idea I
placed our future dwelling, altogether struck me with an impression
so lively, tender, melancholy, and powerful, that I saw myself in
ecstasy transported into that happy time and abode, where my heart,
possessing all the felicity it could desire, might taste it with raptures
inexpressible.
I never recollect to have enjoyed the future with such force of
illusions as at that time; and what has particularly struck me in the
recollection of this reverie, is that when realized, I found my situation
exactly as I had imagined it. If ever waking dream had an
appearance of a prophetic vision, it was assuredly this; I was only
deceived in its imaginary duration, for days, years, and life itself,
passed ideally in perfect tranquility, while the reality lasted but a
moment. Alas! my most durable happiness was but as a dream,
which I had no sooner had a glimpse of, than I instantly awoke.
I know not when I should have done, if I was to enter into a detail
of all the follies that affection for my dear Madam de Warrens made
me commit. When absent from her, how often have I kissed the bed

on a supposition that she had slept there; the curtains and all the
furniture of my chamber, on recollecting they were hers, and that her
charming hands had touched them; nay, the floor itself, when I
considered she had walked there. Sometimes even in her presence,
extravagancies escaped me, which only the most violent passions
seemed capable of inspiring; in a word, there was but one essential
difference to distinguish me from an absolute lover, and that
particular renders my situation almost inconceivable.
I had returned from Italy, not absolutely as I went there, but as no
one of my age, perhaps, ever did before, being equally unacquainted
with women. My ardent constitution had found resources in those
means by which youth of my disposition sometimes preserve their
purity at the expense of health, vigor, and frequently of life itself. My
local situation should likewise be considered--living with a pretty
woman, cherishing her image in the bottom of my heart, seeing her
during the whole day, at night surrounded with objects that recalled
her incessantly to my remembrance, and sleeping in the bed where I
knew she had slept. What a situation! Who can read this without
supposing me on the brink of the grave? But quite the contrary; that
which might have ruined me, acted as a preservative, at least for a
time. Intoxicated with the charm of living with her, with the ardent
desire of passing my life there, absent or present I saw in her a
tender mother, an amiable sister, a respected friend, but nothing
more; meantime, her image filled my heart, and left room far no other
object. The extreme tenderness with which she inspired me
excluded every other woman from my consideration, and preserved
me from the whole sex: in a word, I was virtuous, because I loved
her. Let these particulars, which I recount but indifferently, be
considered, and then let any one judge what kind of attachment I
had for her: for my part, all I can say, is, that if it hitherto appears
extraordinary, it will appear much more so in the sequel.
My time passed in the most agreeable manner, though occupied in
a way which was by no means calculated to please me; such as
having projects to digest, bills to write fair, receipts to transcribe,
herbs to pick, drugs to pound, or distillations to attend; and in the
midst of all this, came crowds of travellers, beggars, and visitors of
all denominations. Some times it was necessary to converse at the

same time with a soldier, an apothecary, a prebendary, a fine lady,
and a lay brother. I grumbled, swore, and wished all this troublesome
medley at the devil, while she seemed to enjoy it, laughing at my
chagrin till the tears ran down her cheeks. What excited her mirth still
more, was to see that my anger was increased by not being able
myself to refrain from laughter. These little intervals, in which I
enjoyed the pleasure of grumbling, were charming; and if, during the
dispute, another importunate visitor arrived, she would add to her
amusement by maliciously prolonging the visit, meantime casting
glances at me for which I could almost have beat her; nor could she
without difficulty refrain from laughter on seeing my constrained
politeness, though every moment glancing at her the look of a fury,
while, even in spite of myself, I thought the scene truly diverting.
All this, without being pleasing in itself, contributed to amuse,
because it made up a part of a life which I thought delightful. Nothing
that was performed around me, nothing that I was obliged to do,
suited my taste, but everything suited my heart; and I believe, at
length, I should have liked the study of medicine, had not my natural
distaste to it perpetually engaged us in whimsical scenes, that
prevented my thinking of it in a serious light. It was, perhaps, the first
time that this art produced mirth. I pretended to distinguish a physical
book by its smell, and what was more diverting, was seldom
mistaken. Madam de Warrens made me taste the most nauseous
drugs; in vain I ran, or endeavored to defend myself; spite of
resistance or wry faces, spite of my struggles, or even of my teeth,
when I saw her charming fingers approach my lips, I was obliged to
give up the contest.

When shut up in an apartment with all her medical apparatus, any
one who had heard us running and shouting amidst peals of laughter
would rather have imagined we had been acting a farce than
preparing opiates or elixirs.
My time, however, was not entirely passed in these fooleries; in
the apartment which I occupied I found a few books: there was the
Spectator, Puffendorf, St. Everemond, and the Henriade. Though I
had not my old passion for books, yet I amused myself with reading
a part of them. The Spectator was particularly pleasing and

serviceable to me. The Abbe de Gauvon had taught me to read less
eagerly, and with a greater degree of attention, which rendered my
studies more serviceable. I accustomed myself to reflect on elocution
and the elegance of composition; exercising myself in discerning
pure French from my provincial idiom. For example, I corrected an
orthographical fault (which I had in common with all Genevese) by
these two lines of the Henriade:
Soit qu'un ancient respect pour le sang de leurs maitres,
Parlat encore pour lui dans le coeur de ces traitres
I was struck with the word 'parlat', and found a 't' was necessary to
form the third person of the subjunctive, whereas I had always
written and pronounced it parla, as in the present of the indicative.
Sometimes my studies were the subject of conversation with
Madam de Warrens; sometimes I read to her, in which I found great
satisfaction; and as I endeavored to read well, it was extremely
serviceable to me. I have already observed that her mind was
cultivated; her understanding was at this time in its meridian. Several
people of learning having been assiduous to ingratiate themselves,
had taught her to distinguish works of merit; but her taste (if I may so
express myself) was rather Protestant; ever speaking warmly of
Bayle, and highly esteeming St. Evremond, though long since almost
forgotten in France: but this did not prevent her having a taste for
literature, or expressing her thoughts with elegance. She had been
brought up with polite company, and coming young to Savoy, by
associating with people of the best fashion, had lost the affected
manners of her own country, where the ladies mistake wit for sense,
and only speak in epigram.
Though she had seen the court but superficially, that glance was
sufficient to give her a competent idea of it; and notwithstanding
secret jealousies and the murmurs excited by her conduct and
running in debt, she ever preserved friends there, and never lost her
pension. She knew the world, and was useful. This was her favorite
theme in our conversations, and was directly opposite to my
chimerical ideas, though the kind of instruction I particularly had
occasion for. We read Bruyere together; he pleased her more than

Rochefoucault, who is a dull, melancholy author, particularly to
youth, who are not fond of contemplating man as he really is. In
moralizing she sometimes bewildered herself by the length of her
discourse; but by kissing her lips or hand from time to time I was
easily consoled, and never found them wearisome.
This life was too delightful to be lasting; I felt this, and the
uneasiness that thought gave me was the only thing that disturbed
my enjoyment. Even in playfulness she studied my disposition,
observed and interrogated me, forming projects for my future
fortune, which I could readily have dispensed with. Happily it was not
sufficient to know my disposition, inclinations and talents; it was
likewise necessary to find a situation in which they would be useful,
and this was not the work of a day. Even the prejudices this good
woman had conceived in favor of my merit put off the time of calling
it into action, by rendering her more difficult in the choice of means;
thus (thanks to the good opinion she entertained of me), everything
answered to my wish; but a change soon happened which put a
period to my tranquility.
A relation of Madam de Warrens, named M. d'Aubonne, came to
see her; a man of great understanding and intrigue, being, like her,
fond of projects, though careful not to ruin himself by them. He had
offered Cardinal Fleury a very compact plan for a lottery, which,
however, had not been approved of, and he was now going to
propose it to the court of Turin, where it was accepted and put into
execution. He remained some time at Annecy, where he fell in love
with the Intendant's lady, who was very amiable, much to my taste
and the only person I saw with pleasure at the house of Madam de
Warrens. M. d'Aubonne saw me, I was strongly recommended by his
relation; he promised, therefore, to question and see what I was fit
for, and, if he found me capable to seek me a situation. Madam de
Warrens sent me to him two or three mornings, under pretense of
messages, without acquainting me with her real intention. He spoke
to me gayly, on various subjects, without any appearance of
observation; his familiarity presently set me talking, which by his
cheerful and jesting manner he encouraged without restraint--I was
absolutely charmed with him. The result of his observations was, that
notwithstanding the animation of my countenance, and promising

exterior, if not absolutely silly, I was a lad of very little sense, and
without ideas of learning; in fine, very ignorant in all respects, and if I
could arrive at being curate of some village, it was the utmost honor I
ought ever to aspire to. Such was the account he gave of me to
Madam de Warrens. This was not the first time such an opinion had
been formed of me, neither was it the last; the judgment of M.
Masseron having been repeatedly confirmed.
The cause of these opinions is too much connected with my
character not to need a particular explanation; for it will not be
supposed that I can in conscience subscribe to them; and with all
possible impartiality, whatever M. Masseron, M. d'Aubonne and
many others may have said, I cannot help thinking them mistaken.
Two things very opposite, unite in me, and in a manner which I
cannot myself conceive. My disposition is extremely ardent, my
passions lively and impetuous, yet my ideas are produced slowly,
with great embarrassment and after much afterthought. It might be
said my heart and understanding do not belong to the same
individual. A sentiment takes possession of my soul with the rapidity
of lightning, but instead of illuminating, it dazzles and confounds me;
I feel all, but see nothing; I am warm, but stupid; to think I must be
cool. What is astonishing, my conception is clear and penetrating, if
not hurried: I can make excellent impromptus at leisure, but on the
instant, could never say or do anything worth notice. I could hold a
tolerable conversation by the post, as they say the Spaniards play at
chess, and when I read that anecdote of a duke of Savoy, who
turned himself round, while on a journey, to cry out 'a votre gorge,
marchand de Paris!' I said, "Here is a trait of my character!"
This slowness of thought, joined to vivacity of feeling, I am not only
sensible of in conversation, but even alone. When I write, my ideas
are arranged with the utmost difficulty. They glance on my
imagination and ferment till they discompose, heat, and bring on a
palpitation; during this state of agitation, I see nothing properly,
cannot write a single word, and must wait till it is over. Insensibly the
agitation subsides, the chaos acquires form, and each circumstance
takes its proper place. Have you never seen an opera in Italy? where
during the change of scene everything is in confusion, the
decorations are intermingled, and any one would suppose that all

would be overthrown; yet by little and little, everything is arranged,
nothing appears wanting, and we feel surprised to see the tumult
succeeded by the most delightful spectacle. This is a resemblance of
what passes in my brain when I attempt to write; had I always waited
till that confusion was past, and then pointed, in their natural
beauties, the objects that had presented themselves, few authors
would have surpassed me.
Thence arises the extreme difficulty I find in writing; my
manuscripts, blotted, scratched, and scarcely legible, attest the
trouble they cost me; nor is there one of them but I have been
obliged to transcribe four or five times before it went to press. Never
could I do anything when placed at a table, pen in hand; it must be
walking among the rocks, or in the woods; it is at night in my bed,
during my wakeful hours, that I compose; it may be judged how
slowly, particularly for a man who has not the advantage of verbal
memory, and never in his life could retain by heart six verses. Some
of my periods I have turned and returned in my head five or six
nights before they were fit to be put to paper: thus it is that I succeed
better in works that require laborious attention, than those that
appear more trivial, such as letters, in which I could never succeed,
and being obliged to write one is to me a serious punishment; nor
can I express my thoughts on the most trivial subjects without it
costing me hours of fatigue. If I write immediately what strikes me,
my letter is a long, confused, unconnected string of expressions,
which, when read, can hardly be understood.
It is not only painful to me to give language to my ideas but even
to receive them. I have studied mankind, and think myself a tolerable
observer, yet I know nothing from what I see, but all from what I
remember, nor have I understanding except in my recollections.
From all that is said, from all that passes in my presence, I feel
nothing, conceive nothing, the exterior sign being all that strikes me;
afterwards it returns to my remembrance; I recollect the place, the
time, the manner, the look, and gesture, not a circumstance escapes
me; it is then, from what has been done or said, that I imagine what
has been thought, and I have rarely found myself mistaken.
So little master of my understanding when alone, let any one judge
what I must be in conversation, where to speak with any degree of

ease you must think of a thousand things at the same time: the bare
idea that I should forget something material would be sufficient to
intimidate me. Nor can I comprehend how people can have the
confidence to converse in large companies, where each word must
pass in review before so many, and where it would be requisite to
know their several characters and histories to avoid saying what
might give offence. In this particular, those who frequent the world
would have a great advantage, as they know better where to be
silent, and can speak with greater confidence; yet even they
sometimes let fall absurdities; in what predicament then must he be
who drops as it were from the clouds? it is almost impossible he
should speak ten minutes with impunity.
In a tete-a-tete there is a still worse inconvenience; that is; the
necessity of talking perpetually, at least, the necessity of answering
when spoken to, and keeping up the conversation when the other is
silent. This insupportable constraint is alone sufficient to disgust me
with variety, for I cannot form an idea of a greater torment than being
obliged to speak continually without time for recollection. I know not
whether it proceeds from my mortal hatred of all constraint; but if I
am obliged to speak, I infallibly talk nonsense. What is still worse,
instead of learning how to be silent when I have absolutely nothing to
say, it is generally at such times that I have a violent inclination: and
endeavoring to pay my debt of conversation as speedily as possible,
I hastily gabble a number of words without ideas, happy when they
only chance to mean nothing; thus endeavoring to conquer or hide
my incapacity, I rarely fail to show it.
I think I have said enough to show that, though not a fool, I have
frequently passed for one, even among people capable of judging;
this was the more vexatious, as my physiognomy and eyes promised
otherwise, and expectation being frustrated, my stupidity appeared
the more shocking. This detail, which a particular occasion gave birth
to, will not be useless in the sequel, being a key to many of my
actions which might otherwise appear unaccountable; and have
been attributed to a savage humor I do not possess. I love society as
much as any man, was I not certain to exhibit myself in it, not only
disadvantageously, but totally different from what I really am. The
plan I have adopted of writing and retirement, is what exactly suits

me. Had I been present, my worth would never have been known, no
one would even have suspected it; thus it was with Madam Dupin, a
woman of sense, in whose house I lived for several years; indeed,
she has often since owned it to me: though on the whole this rule
may be subject to some exceptions. I shall now return to my history.
The estimate of my talents thus fixed, the situation I was capable
of promised, the question only remained how to render her capable
of fulfilling my destined vocation. The principle difficulty was, I did not
know Latin enough for a priest. Madam de Warrens determined to
have me taught for some time at the seminary, and accordingly
spoke of it to the Superior, who was a Lazarist, called M. Gras, a
good-natured little fellow, half blind, meagre, gray-haired, insensible,
and the least pedantic of any Lazarist I ever knew; which, in fact, is
saying no great matter.
He frequently visited Madam de Warrens, who entertained,
caressed, and made much of him, letting him sometimes lace her
stays, an office he was willing enough to perform. While thus
employed, she would run about the room, this way or that, as
occasion happened to call her. Drawn by the lace, Monsieur the
Superior followed, grumbling, repeating at every moment, "Pray,
madam, do stand still;" the whole forming a scene truly diverting.
M. Gras willingly assented to the project of Madam de Warrens,
and, for a very moderate pension, charged himself with the care of
instructing me. The consent of the bishop was all that remained
necessary, who not only granted it, but offered to pay the pension,
permitting me to retain the secular habit till they could judge by a trial
what success they might have in my improvement.
What a change! but I was obliged to submit; though I went to the
seminary with about the same spirits as if they had been taking me
to execution. What a melancholy abode! especially for one who left
the house of a pretty woman. I carried one book with me, that I had
borrowed of Madam de Warrens, and found it a capital resource! it
will not be easily conjectured what kind of book this was--it was a
music book. Among the talents she had cultivated, music was not
forgotten; she had a tolerable good voice, sang agreeably, and
played on the harpsichord. She had taken the pains to give me some
lessons in singing, though before I was very uninformed in that

respect, hardly knowing the music of our psalms. Eight or ten
interrupted lessons, far from putting me in a condition to improve
myself, did not teach me half the notes; notwithstanding, I had such
a passion for the art, that I determined to exercise myself alone. The
book I took was not of the most easy kind; it was the cantatas of
Clerambault. It may be conceived with what attention and
perseverance I studied, when I inform my reader, that without
knowing anything of transposition or quantity, I contrived to sing with
tolerable correctness, the first recitative and air in the cantata of
Alpheus and Arethusa; it is true this air is, so justly set, that it is only
necessary to recite the verses in their just measure to catch the
music.
There was at the seminary a curst Lazarist, who by undertaking to
teach me Latin made me detest it. His hair was coarse, black and
greasy, his face like those formed in gingerbread, he had the voice of
a buffalo, the countenance of an owl, and the bristles of a boar in lieu
of a beard; his smile was sardonic, and his limbs played like those of
a puppet moved by wires. I have forgotten his odious name, but the
remembrance of his frightful precise countenance remains with me,
though hardly can I recollect it without trembling; especially when I
call to mind our meeting in the gallery, when he graciously advanced
his filthy square cap as a sign for me to enter his apartment, which
appeared more dismal in my apprehension than a dungeon. Let any
one judge the contrast between my present master and the elegant
Abbe de Gauvon.
Had I remained two months at the mercy of this monster, I am
certain my head could not have sustained it; but the good M. Gras,
perceiving I was melancholy, grew thin, and did not eat my victuals,
guessed the cause of my uneasiness (which indeed was not very
difficult) and taking me from the claws of this beast, by another yet
more striking contrast, placed me with the gentlest of men, a young
Faucigneran abbe, named M. Gatier, who studied at the seminary,
and out of complaisance for M. Gras, and humanity to myself,
spared some time from the prosecution of his own studies in order to
direct mine. Never did I see a more pleasing countenance than that
of M. Gatier. He was fair complexioned, his beard rather inclined to
red; his behavior like that of the generality of his countrymen (who

under a coarseness of countenance conceal much understanding),
marked in him a truly sensible and affectionate soul. In his large blue
eyes there was a mixture of softness, tenderness, and melancholy,
which made it impossible to see him without feeling one's self
interested. From the looks and manner of this young abbe he might
have been supposed to have foreseen his destiny, and that he was
born to be unhappy.
His disposition did not belie his physiognomy: full of patience and
complaisance, he rather appeared to study with than to instruct me.
So much was not necessary to make me love him, his predecessor
having rendered that very easy; yet, notwithstanding all the time he
bestowed on me, notwithstanding our mutual good inclinations, and
that his plan of teaching was excellent, with much labor, I made little
progress. It is very singular, that with a clear conception I could
never learn much from masters except my father and M. Lambercier;
the little I know besides I have learned alone, as will be seen
hereafter. My spirit, impatient of every species of constraint, cannot
submit to the law of the moment; even the fear of not learning
prevents my being attentive, and a dread of wearying those who
teach, makes me feign to understand them; thus they proceed faster
than I can comprehend, and the conclusion is I learn nothing. My
understanding must take its own time and cannot submit to that of
another.
The time of ordination being arrived, M. Gatier returned to his
province as deacon, leaving me with gratitude, attachment, and
sorrow for his loss. The vows I made for him were no more
answered than those I offered for myself. Some years after, I
learned, that being vicar of a parish, a young girl was with child by
him, being the only one (though he possessed a very tender heart)
with whom he was ever in love. This was a dreadful scandal in a
diocese severely governed, where the priests (being under good
regulation) ought never to have children--except by married women.
Having infringed this politic law, he was put in prison, defamed, and
driven from his benefice. I know not whether it was ever after in his
power to reestablish his affairs; but the remembrance of his
misfortunes, which were deeply engraven on my heart, struck me
when I wrote Emilius, and uniting M. Gatier with M. Gaime, I formed

from these two worthy priests the character of the Savoyard Vicar,
and flatter myself the imitation has not dishonored the originals.
While I was at the seminary, M. d'Aubonne was obliged to quit
Annecy, Moultou being displeased that he made love to his wife,
which was acting like a dog in the manger, for though Madam
Moultou was extremely amiable, he lived very ill with her, treating her
with such brutality that a separation was talked of. Moultou, by
repeated oppressions, at length procured a dismissal from his
employment: he was a disagreeable man; a mole could not be
blacker, nor an owl more knavish. It is said the provincials revenge
themselves on their enemies by songs; M. d'Aubonne revenged
himself on his by a comedy, which he sent to Madam de Warrens,
who showed it to me. I was pleased with it, and immediately
conceived the idea of writing one, to try whether I was so silly as the
author had pronounced me. This project was not executed till I went
to Chambery, where I wrote 'The Lover of Himself'. Thus when I said
in the preface to that piece, "it was written at eighteen," I cut off a
few years.
Nearly about this time an event happened, not very important in
itself, but whose consequence affected me, and made a noise in the
world when I had forgotten it. Once a week I was permitted to go out;
it is not necessary to say what use I made of this liberty. Being one
Sunday at Madam de Warrens, a building belonging to the
Cordeliers, which joined her house, took fire; this building which
contained their oven, being full of dry fagots, blazed violently and
greatly endangered the house; for the wind happening to drive the
flames that way, it was covered with them. The furniture, therefore,
was hastily got out and carried into the garden which fronted the
windows, on the other side the before-mentioned brook. I was so
alarmed that I threw indiscriminately everything that came to hand
out of the window, even to a large stone mortar, which at another
time I should have found it difficult to remove, and should have
thrown a handsome looking-glass after it had not some one
prevented me. The good bishop, who that day was visiting Madam
de Warrens, did not remain idle; he took her into the garden, where
they went to prayers with the rest that were assembled there, and
where sometime afterwards, I found them on their knees, and

presently joined them. While the good man was at his devotions, the
wind changed, so suddenly and critically, that the flames which had
covered the house and began to enter the windows, were carried to
the other side of the court, and the house received no damage. Two
years after, Monsieur de Berner being dead, the Antoines, his former
brethren, began to collect anecdotes which might serve as
arguments of his beatification; at the desire of Father Baudet, I
joined to these an attestation of what I have just related, in doing
which, though I attested no more than the truth, I certainly acted ill,
as it tended to make an indifferent occurrence pass for a miracle. I
had seen the bishop in prayer, and had likewise seen the wind
change during the prayer, and even much to the purpose, all this I
could certify truly; but that one of these facts was the cause of the
other, I ought not to have attested, because it is what I could not
possibly be assured of. Thus much I may say, that as far as I can
recollect what my ideas were at that time, I was sincerely, and in
good earnest a Catholic. Love of the marvellous is natural to the
human heart; my veneration for the virtuous prelate, and secret pride
in having, perhaps, contributed to the event in question, all helped to
seduce me; and certainly, if this miracle was the effect of ardent
prayer, I had a right to claim a share of the merits.
More than thirty years after, when I published the 'Lettres de la
Montagne', M. Feron (I know not by what means) discovered this
attestation, and made use of it in his paper. I must confess the
discovery was very critically timed, and appeared very diverting,
even to me.
I was destined to be the outcast of every condition; for
notwithstanding M. Gatier gave the most favorable account he
possibly could of my studies, they plainly saw the improvement I
received bore no proportion to the pains taken to instruct me, which
was no encouragement to continue them: the bishop and superior,
therefore, were disheartened, and I was sent back to Madam de
Warrens, as a subject not even fit to make a priest of; but as they
allowed, at the same time, that I was a tolerably good lad, and far
from being vicious, this account counterbalanced the former, and
determined her not to abandon me.

I carried back in triumph the dear music book, which had been so
useful to me, the air of Alpheus and Arethusa being almost all I had
learned at the seminary. My predilection for this art started the idea
of making a musician of, me. A convenient opportunity offered; once
a week, at least, she had a concert at her house, and the musicmaster from the cathedral, who directed this little band, came
frequently to see her. This was a Parisian, named M. le Maitre, a
good composer, very lively, gay, young, well made, of little
understanding, but, upon the whole, a good sort of man. Madam de
Warrens made us acquainted; I attached myself to him, and he
seemed not displeased with me. A pension was talked of, and
agreed on; in short, I went home with him, and passed the winter the
more agreeably at his chambers, as they were not above twenty
paces distant from Madam de Warrens', where we frequently supped
together. It may easily be supposed that this situation, ever gay, and
singing with the musicians and children of the choir, was more
pleasing to me than the seminary and fathers of St. Lazarus. This
life, though free, was regular; here I learned to prize independence,
but never to abuse it. For six whole months I never once went out
except to see Madam de Warrens, or to church, nor had I any
inclination to it. This interval is one of those in which I enjoyed the
greatest satisfaction, and which I have ever recollected with
pleasure. Among the various situations I have been placed in, some
were marked with such an idea of virtuous satisfaction, that the bare
remembrance affects me as if they were yet present. I vividly
recollect the time, the place, the persons, and even the temperature
of the air, while the lively idea of a certain local impression peculiar
to those times, transports me back again to the very spot; for
example, all that was repeated at our meetings, all that was sung in
the choir, everything that passed there; the beautiful and noble
habits of the canons, the chasubles of the priests, the mitres of the
singers, the persons of the musicians; an old lame carpenter who
played the counter-bass, a little fair abbe who performed on the
violin, the ragged cassock which M. le Maitre, after taking off his
sword, used to put over his secular habit, and the fine surplice with
which he covered the rags of the former, when he went to the choir;
the pride with which I held my little flute to my lips, and seated myself

in the orchestra, to assist in a recitative which M. le Maitre had
composed on purpose for me; the good dinner that afterwards
awaited us, and the good appetites we carried to it. This concourse
of objects, strongly retraced in my memory, has charmed me a
hundred time as much, or perhaps more, than ever the reality had
done. I have always preserved an affection for a certain air of the
'Conditor alme Syderum', because one Sunday in Advent I heard
that hymn sung on the steps of the cathedral, (according to the
custom of that place) as I lay in bed before daybreak. Mademoiselle
Merceret, Madam de Warrens' chambermaid, knew something of
music; I shall never forget a little piece that M. le Maitre made me
sing with her, and which her mistress listened to with great
satisfaction. In a word, every particular, even down to the servant
Perrine, whom the boys of the choir took such delight in teasing. The
remembrance of these times of happiness and innocence frequently
returning to my mind, both ravish and affect me.
I lived at Annecy during a year without the least reproach, giving
universal satisfaction. Since my departure from Turin I had been
guilty of no folly, committed none while under the eye of Madam de
Warrens. She was my conductor, and ever led me right; my
attachment for her became my only passion, and what proves it was
not a giddy one, my heart and understanding were in unison. It is
true that a single sentiment, absorbing all my faculties, put me out of
a capacity of learning even music: but this was not my fault, since to
the strongest inclination, I added the utmost assiduity. I was attentive
and thoughtful; what could I do? Nothing was wanting towards my
progress that depended on me; meantime, it only required a subject
that might inspire me to occasion the commission of new follies: that
subject presented itself, chance arranged it, and (as will be seen
hereafter) my inconsiderate head gave in to it.
One evening, in the month of February, when it was very cold,
being all sat round the fire, we heard some one knock at the street
door. Perrine took a light, went down and opened it: a young man
entering, came upstairs, presented himself with an easy air, and
making M. Maitre a short, but well-turned compliment, announced
himself as a French musician, constrained by the state of his
finances to take this liberty. The hart of the good Le Maitre leaped at

the name of a French musician, for he passionately loved both his
country and profession; he therefore offered the young traveller his
service--and use of his apartment, which he appeared to stand much
in need of, and which he accepted without much ceremony. I
observed him while he was chatting and warming himself before
supper; he was short and thick, having some fault in his shape,
though without any particular deformity; he had (if I may so express
myself) an appearance of being hunchbacked, with flat shoulders,
and I think he limped. He wore a black coat, rather worn than old,
which hung in tatters, a very fine but dirty shirt, frayed ruffles; a pair
of splatterdashes so large that he could have put both legs into
either of them, and, to secure himself from the snow, a little hat, only
fit to be carried under his arm. With this whimsical equipage, he had,
however, something elegant in his manners and conversation; his
countenance was expressive and agreeable, and he spoke with
facility if not with modesty; in short, everything about him bore the
mark of a young debauchee, who did not crave assistance like a
beggar, but as a thoughtless madcap. He told us his name was
Venture de Villeneuve, that he came from Paris, had lost his way,
and seeming to forget that he had announced himself for a musician,
added that he was going to Grenoble to see a relation that was a
member of Parliament.
During supper we talked of music, on which subject he spoke well:
he knew all the great virtuosi, all the celebrated works, all the actors,
actresses, pretty women, and powerful lords; in short nothing was
mentioned but what he seemed thoroughly acquainted with. Though
no sooner was any topic started, than by some drollery, which set
every one a-laughing, he made them forget what had been said. This
was on a Saturday; the next day there was to be music at the
cathedral: M. le Maitre asked if he would sing there--"Very willingly."-"What part would he chose?"--"The counter-tenor:" and immediately
began speaking of other things. Before he went to church they
offered him his part to peruse, but he did not even look at it. This
Gasconade surprised Le Maitre --"You'll see," said he, whispering to
me, "that he does not know a single note."--I replied: "I am very
much afraid of him." I followed them into the church; but was

extremely uneasy, and when they began, my heart beat violently, so
much was I interested in his behalf.
I was presently out of pain: he sung his two recitatives with all
imaginable taste and judgment; and what was yet more, with a very
agreeable voice. I never enjoyed a more pleasing surprise. After
mass, M. Venture received the highest compliments from the canons
and musicians, which he answered jokingly, though with great grace.
M. le Maitre embraced him heartily; I did the same; he saw I was
rejoiced at his success, and appeared pleased at my satisfaction.
It will easily be surmised, that after having been delighted with M.
Bacle, who had little to attract my admiration, I should be infatuated
with M. Venture, who had education, wit, talents, and a knowledge of
the world, and might be called an agreeable rake. This was exactly
what happened, and would, I believe, have happened to any other
young man in my place; especially supposing him possessed of
better judgment to distinguish merit, and more propensity to be
engaged by it; for Venture doubtless possessed a considerable
share, and one in particular, very rare at his age, namely, that of
never being in haste to display his talents. It is true, he boasted of
many things he did not understand, but of those he knew (which
were very numerous) he said nothing, patiently waiting some
occasion to display them, which he then did with ease, though
without forwardness, and thus gave them more effect. As there was
ever some intermission between the proofs of his various abilities, it
was impossible to conjecture whether he had ever discovered all his
talents. Playful, giddy, inexhaustible, seducing in conversation, ever
smiling, but never laughing, and repeating the rudest things in the
most elegant manner--even the most modest women were
astonished at what they endured from him: it was in vain for them to
determine to be angry; they could not assume the appearance of it. It
was extraordinary that with so many agreeable talents, in a country
where they are so well understood, and so much admired, he so
long remained only a musician.
My attachment to M. Venture, more reasonable in its cause, was
also less extravagant in its effects, though more lively and durable
than that I had conceived for M. Bacle. I loved to see him, to hear
him, all his actions appeared charming, everything he said was an

oracle to me, but the enchantment did not extend far enough to
disable me from quitting him. I spoke of him with transport to Madam
de Warrens, Le Maitre likewise spoke in his praise, and she
consented we should bring him to her house. This interview did not
succeed; he thought her affected, she found him a libertine, and,
alarmed that I had formed such an ill acquaintance, not only forbade
me bringing him there again, but likewise painted so strongly the
danger I ran with this young man, that I became a little more
circumspect in giving in to the attachment; and very happily, both for
my manners and wits, we were soon separated.
M. le Maitre, like most of his profession, loved good wine; at table
he was moderate, but when busy in his closet he must drink. His
maid was so well acquainted with this humor that no sooner had he
prepared his paper to compose, and taken his violoncello, than the
bottle and glass arrived, and was replenished from time to time: thus,
without being ever absolutely intoxicated, he was usually in a state of
elevation. This was really unfortunate, for he had a good heart, and
was so playful that Madam de Warrens used to call him the kitten.
Unhappily, he loved his profession, labored much and drank
proportionately, which injured his health, and at length soured his
temper. Sometimes he was gloomy and easily offended, though
incapable of rudeness, or giving offence to any one, for never did he
utter a harsh word, even to the boys of the choir: on the other hand,
he would not suffer another to offend him, which was but just: the
misfortune was, having little understanding, he did not properly
discriminate, and was often angry without cause.
The Chapter of Geneva, where so many princes and bishops
formerly thought it an honor to be seated, though in exile it lost its
ancient splendor, retained (without any diminution) its pride. To be
admitted, you must either be a gentleman or Doctor of Sorbonne. If
there is a pardonable pride, after that derived from personal merit, it
is doubtless that arising from birth, though, in general, priests having
laymen in their service treat them with sufficient haughtiness, and
thus the canons behaved to poor Le Maitre. The chanter, in
particular, who was called the Abbe de Vidonne, in other respects a
well-behaved man, but too full of his nobility, did not always show
him the attention his talents merited. M. le Maitre could not bear

these indignities patiently; and this year, during passion week, they
had a more serious dispute than ordinary. At an institution dinner that
the bishop gave the canons, and to which M. Maitre was always
invited, the abbe failed in some formality, adding, at the same time,
some harsh words, which the other could not digest; he instantly
formed the resolution to quit them the following night; nor could any
consideration make him give up his design, though Madam de
Warrens (whom he went to take leave of) spared no pains to
appease him. He could not relinquish the pleasure of leaving his
tyrants embarrassed for the Easter feast, at which time he knew they
stood in greatest need of him. He was most concerned about his
music, which he wished to take with him; but this could not easily be
accomplished, as it filled a large case, and was very heavy, and
could not be carried under the arm.
Madam de Warrens did what I should have done in her situation;
and indeed, what I should yet do: after many useless efforts to retain
him, seeing he was resolved to depart, whatever might be the event,
she formed the resolution to give him every possible assistance. I
must confess Le Maitre deserved it of her, for he was (if I may use
the expression) dedicated to her service, in whatever appertained to
either his art or knowledge, and the readiness with which he obliged
gave a double value to his complaisance: thus she only paid back,
on an essential occasion, the many favors he had been long
conferring on her; though I should observe, she possessed a soul
that, to fulfill such duties, had no occasion to be reminded of
previous obligations. Accordingly she ordered me to follow Le Maitre
to Lyons, and to continue with him as long as he might have
occasion for my services. She has since avowed, that a desire of
detaching me from Venture had a great hand in this arrangement.
She consulted Claude Anet about the conveyance of the abovementioned case. He advised, that instead of hiring a beast at
Annecy, which would infallibly discover us, it would be better, at
night, to take it to some neighboring village, and there hire an ass to
carry it to Seyssel, which being in the French dominions, we should
have nothing to fear. This plan was adopted; we departed the same
night at seven, and Madam de Warrens, under pretense of paying
my expenses, increased the purse of poor Le Maitre by an addition

that was very acceptable. Claude Anet, the gardiner, and myself,
carried the case to the first village, then hired an ass, and the same
night reached Seyssel.
I think I have already remarked that there are times in which I am
so unlike myself that I might be taken for a man of a direct opposite
disposition; I shall now give an example of this. M. Reydelet, curate
of Seyssel, was canon of St. Peter's, consequently known to M. le
Maitre, and one of the people from whom he should have taken most
pains to conceal himself; my advice, on the contrary, was to present
ourselves to him, and, under some pretext, entreat entertainment as
if we visited him by consent of the chapter. Le Maitre adopted the
idea, which seemed to give his revenge the appearance of satire and
waggery; in short, we went boldly to Reydelet, who received us very
kindly. Le Maitre told him he was going to Bellay by desire of the
bishop, that he might superintend the music during the Easter
holidays, and that he proposed returning that way in a few days. To
support this tale, I told a hundred others, so naturally that M.
Reydelet thought me a very agreeable youth, and treated me with
great friendship and civility. We were well regaled and well lodged:
M. Reydelet scarcely knew how to make enough of us; and we
parted the best friends in the world, with a promise to stop longer on
our return. We found it difficult to refrain from laughter, or wait till we
were alone to give free vent to our mirth: indeed, even now, the bare
recollection of it forces a smile, for never was waggery better or
more fortunately maintained. This would have made us merry during
the remainder of our journey, if M. le Maitre (who did not cease
drinking) had not been two or three times attacked with a complaint
that he afterwards became very subject to, and which resembled an
epilepsy. These fits threw me into the most fearful embarrassments,
from which I resolved to extricate myself with the first opportunity.
According to the information given to M. Reydelet, we passed our
Easter holidays at Bellay, and though not expected there, were
received by the music--master, and welcomed by every one with
great pleasure. M. le Maitre was of considerable note in his
profession, and, indeed, merited that distinction. The music-master
of Bellay (who was fond of his own works) endeavored to obtain the
approbation of so good a judge; for besides being a connoisseur, M.

le Maitre was equitable, neither a jealous, ill-natured critic, nor a
servile flatterer. He was so superior to the generality of country
music-masters and they were so sensible of it, that they treated him
rather as their chief than a brother musician.
Having passed four or five days very agreeably at Bellay, we
departed, and continuing our journey without meeting with any
accidents, except those I have just spoken of, arrived at Lyons, and
were lodged at Notre Dame de Pitie. While we waited for the arrival
of the before-mentioned case (which by the assistance of another lie,
and the care of our good patron, M. Reydelet, we had embarked on
the Rhone) M. le Maitre went to visit his acquaintance, and among
others Father Cato, a Cordelier, who will be spoken of hereafter, and
the Abbe Dortan, Count of Lyons, both of whom received him well,
but afterwards betrayed him, as will be seen presently; indeed, his
good fortune terminated with M. Reydelet.
Two days after our arrival at Lyons, as we passed a little street not
far from our inn, Le Maitre was attacked by one of his fits; but it was
now so violent as to give me the utmost alarm. I screamed with
terror, called for help, and naming our inn, entreated some one to
bear him to it, then (while the people were assembled, and busy
round a man that had fallen senseless in the street) he was
abandoned by the only friend on whom he could have any
reasonable dependence; I seized the instant when no one heeded
me, turned the corner of the street and disappeared. Thanks to
Heaven, I have made my third painful confession; if many such
remained, I should certainly abandon the work I have undertaken.
Of all the incidents I have yet related, a few traces are remaining
in the places where I have lived; but what I have to relate in the
following book is almost entirely unknown; these are the greatest
extravagancies of my life, and it is happy they had not worse
conclusions. My head, (if I may use the simile) screwed up to the
pitch of an instrument it did not naturally accord with, had lost its
diapason; in time it returned to it again, when I discontinued my
follies, or at least gave in to those more consonant to my disposition.
This epoch of my youth I am least able to recollect, nothing having
passed sufficiently interesting to influence my heart, to make me
clearly retrace the remembrance. In so many successive changes, it

is difficult not to make some transpositions of time or place. I write
absolutely from memory, without notes or materials to help my
recollection. Some events are as fresh in my idea as if they had
recently happened, but there are certain chasms which I cannot fill
up but by the aid of recital, as confused as the remaining traces of
those to which they refer. It is possible, therefore, that I may have
erred in trifles, and perhaps shall again, but in every matter of
importance I can answer that the account is faithfully exact, and with
the same veracity the reader may depend I shall be careful to
continue it.
My resolution was soon taken after quitting Le Maitre; I set out
immediately for Annecy. The cause and mystery of our departure
had interested me for the security of our retreat: this interest, which
entirely employed my thoughts for some days, had banished every
other idea; but no sooner was I secure and in tranquility, than my
predominant sentiment regained its place. Nothing flattered, nothing
tempted me, I had no wish but to return to Madam de Warrens; the
tenderness and truth of my attachment to her had rooted from my
heart every imaginable project, and all the follies of ambition, I
conceived no happiness but living near her, nor could I take a step
without feeling that the distance between us was increased. I
returned, therefore, as soon as possible, with such speed, and with
my spirits in such a state of agitation, that though I recall with
pleasure all my other travels, I have not the least recollection of this,
only remembering my leaving Lyons and reaching Annecy. Let
anyone judge whether this last event can have slipped my memory,
when informed that on my arrival I found Madam de Warrens was
not there, having set out for Paris.
I was never well informed of the motives of this journey. I am
certain she would have told me had I asked her, but never was man
less curious to learn the secrets of his friend. My heart is ever so
entirely filled with the present, or with past pleasures, which become
a principal part of my enjoyment, that there is not a chink or corner
for curiosity to enter. All that I conceive from what I heard of it, is,
that in the revolution caused at Turin by the abdication of the King of
Sardinia, she feared being forgotten, and was willing by favor of the
intrigues of M. d' Aubonne to seek the same advantage in the court

of France, where she has often told me she should, have preferred
it, as the multiplicity of business there prevents your conduct from
being so closely inspected. If this was her business, it is astonishing
that on her return she was not ill received; be that as it will, she
continued to enjoy her allowance without any interruption. Many
people imagined she was charged with some secret commission,
either by the bishop, who then had business at the court of France,
where he himself was soon after obliged to go, or some one yet
more powerful, who knew how to insure her a gracious reception at
her return. If this was the case, it is certain the ambassadress was
not ill chosen, since being young and handsome, she had all the
necessary qualifications to succeed in a negotiation.

Let any one judge my surprise and grief at not finding her on my
arrival. I now felt regret at having abandoned M. le Maitre, and my
uneasiness increased when I learned the misfortunes that had
befallen him. His box of music, containing all his fortune, that
precious box, preserved with so much care and fatigue, had been
seized on at Lyons by means of Count Dortan, who had received
information from the Chapter of our having absconded with it. In vain
did Le Maitre reclaim his property, his means of existence, the labor
of his life; his right to the music in question was at least subject to
litigation, but even that liberty was not allowed him, the affair being
instantly decided on the principal of superior strength. Thus poor Le
Maitre lost the fruit of his talents, the labor of his youth, and principal
dependence for the support of old age.
Nothing was wanting to render the news I had received truly
afflicting, but I was at an age when even the greatest calamities are
to be sustained; accordingly I soon found consolation. I expected
shortly to hear news of Madam de Warrens, though I was ignorant of
the address, and she knew nothing of my return. As to my desertion
of Le Maitre (all things considered) I did not find it so very culpable. I
had been serviceable to him at his retreat; it was not in my power to
give him any further assistance. Had I remained with him in France it
would not have cured his complaint. I could not have saved his
music, and should only have doubled his expense: in this point of
view I then saw my conduct; I see it otherwise now. It frequently
happens that a villainous action does not torment us at the instant
we commit it, but on recollection, and sometimes even after a

number of years have elapsed, for the remembrance of crimes is not
to be extinguished.
The only means I had to obtain news of Madam de Warrens was
to remain at Annecy. Where should I seek her in Paris? or how bear
the expense of such a journey? Sooner or later there was no place
where I could be so certain to hear of her as that I was now at; this
consideration determined me to remain there, though my conduct
was very indifferent. I did not go to the bishop, who had already
befriended me, and might continue to do so; my patroness was not
present, and I feared his reprimands on the subject of our flight;
neither did I go to the seminary, M. Graswas no longer there; in
short, I went to none of my acquaintances. I should gladly have
visited the intendant's lady, but did not dare; I did worse, I sought out
M. Venture, whom (notwithstanding my enthusiasm) I had never
thought of since my departure. I found him quite gay, in high spirits,
and the universal favorite of the ladies of Annecy.
This success completed my infatuation; I saw nothing but M.
Venture; he almost made me forget even Madam de Warrens. That I
might profit more at ease by his instructions and example, I
proposed to share his lodgings, to which he readily consented. It was
at a shoemaker's; a pleasant, jovial fellow, who, in his county dialect,
called his wife nothing but trollop; an appellation which she certainly
merited. Venture took care to augment their differences, though
under an appearance of doing the direct contrary, throwing out in a
distant manner, and provincial accents, hints that produced the
utmost effect, and furnished such scenes as were sufficient to make
any one die with laughter. Thus the mornings passed without our
thinking of them; at two or three o'clock we took some refreshment.
Venture then went to his various engagements, where he supped,
while I walked alone, meditating on his great merit, coveting and
admiring his rare talents, and cursing my own unlucky stars, that did
not call me to so happy a life. How little did I then know of myself!
mine had been a thousand times more delightful, had I not been
such a fool, or known better how to enjoy it.
Madam de Warrens had taken no one with her but Anet: Merceret,
the chambermaid, whom I have before mentioned, still remained in
the house. Merceret was something older than myself, not pretty, but

tolerably agreeable; good-natured, free from malice, having no fault
to my knowledge but being a little refractory with her mistress. I often
went to see her; she was an old acquaintance, who recalled to my
remembrance one more beloved, and this made her dear to me. She
had several friends, and among others one Mademoiselle Giraud, a
Genevese, who, for the punishment of my sins, took it in her head to
have an inclination for me, always pressing Merceret, when she
returned her visits, to bring me with her. As I liked Merceret, I felt no
disinclination to accompany her; besides I met there with some
young people whose company pleased me. For Mademoiselle
Giraud, who offered every kind of enticement, nothing could increase
the aversion I had for her. When she drew near me, with her dried
black snout, smeared with Spanish snuff, it was with the utmost
difficulty that I could refrain from expressing my distaste; but, being
pleased with her visitors, I took patience. Among these were two
girls who (either to pay their court to Mademoiselle Giraud or myself)
paid me every possible attention. I conceived this to be only
friendship; but have since thought it depended only on myself to
have discovered something more, though I did not even think of it at
the time.
There was another reason for my stupidity. Seamstresses,
chambermaids, or milliners, never tempted me; I sighed for ladies!
Every one has his peculiar taste, this has ever been mine; being in
this particular of a different opinion from Horace. Yet it is not vanity of
riches or rank that attracts me; it is a well-preserved complexion, fine
hands, elegance of ornaments, an air of delicacy and neatness
throughout the whole person; more in taste, in the manner of
expressing themselves, a finer or better made gown, a well-turned
ankle, small foot, ribbons, lace, and well-dressed hair; I even prefer
those who have less natural beauty, provided they are elegantly
decorated. I freely confess this preference is very ridiculous; yet my
heart gives in to it spite of my understanding. Well, even this
advantage presented itself, and it only depended on my own
resolution to have seized the opportunity.
How do I love, from time to time, to return to those moments of my
youth, which were so charmingly delightful; so short, so scarce, and
enjoyed at so cheap a rate!--how fondly do I wish to dwell on them!

Even yet the remembrance of these scenes warms my heart with a
chaste rapture, which appears necessary to reanimate my drooping
courage, and enable me to sustain the weariness of my latter days.
The appearance of Aurora seemed so delightful one morning that,
putting on my clothes, I hastened into the country, to see the rising of
the sun. I enjoyed that pleasure in its utmost extent; it was one week
after midsummer; the earth was covered with verdure and flowers,
the nightingales, whose soft warblings were almost concluded,
seemed to vie with each other, and in concert with birds of various
kinds to bid adieu to spring, and hail the approach of a beautiful
summer's day: one of those lovely days that are no longer to be
enjoyed at my age, and which have never been seen on the
melancholy soil I now inhabit.
I had rambled insensibly, to a considerable distance from the
town--the heat augmented--I was walking in the shade along a
valley, by the side of a brook, I heard behind me the steps of horses,
and the voice of some females who, though they seemed
embarrassed, did not laugh the less heartily on that account. I turn
round, hear myself called by name, and approaching, find two young
people of my acquaintance, Mademoiselle de G---- and
Mademoiselle Galley, who, not being very excellent horsewomen,
could not make their horses cross the rivulet.
Mademoiselle de G---- was a young lady of Berne, very amiable;
who, having been sent from that country for some youthful folly, had
imitated Madam de Warrens, at whose house I had sometimes seen
her; but not having, like her, a pension, she had been fortunate in
this attachment to Mademoiselle Galley, who had prevailed on her
mother to engage her young friend as a companion, till she could be
otherwise provided for. Mademoiselle Galley was one year younger
than her friend, handsomer, more delicate, more ingenious, and to
complete all, extremely well made. They loved each other tenderly,
and the good disposition of both could not fail to render their union
durable, if some lover did not derange it. They informed me they
were going to Toune, an old castle belonging to Madam Galley, and
implored my assistance to make their horses cross the stream, not
being able to compass it themselves. I would have given each a cut
or two with the whip, but they feared I might be kicked, and

themselves thrown; I therefore had recourse to another expedient, I
took hold of Mademoiselle Galley's horse and led him through the
brook, the water reaching half-way up my legs. The other followed
without any difficulty. This done, I would have paid my compliments
to the ladies, and walked off like a great booby as I was, but after
whispering each other, Mademoiselle de G---- said, "No, no, you
must not think to escape thus; you have got wet in our service, and
we ought in conscience to take care and dry you. If you please you
must go with us, you are now our prisoner." My heart began to beat-I looked at Mademoiselle Galley --"Yes, yes," added she, laughing at
my fearful look; "our prisoner of war; come, get up behind her, we
shall give a good account of you."--"But, mademoiselle," continued I,
"I have not the honor to be acquainted with your mother; what will
she say on my arrival?"--"Her mother," replied Mademoiselle de G---is not at Toune, we are alone, we shall return at night, and you shall
come back with us."
The stroke of electricity has not a more instantaneous effect than
these words produced on me. Leaping behind Mademoiselle de G---, I trembled with joy, and when it became necessary to clasp her in
order to hold myself on, my heart beat so violently that she perceived
it, and told me hers beat also from a fear of falling. In my present
posture, I might naturally have considered this an invitation to satisfy
myself of the truth of her assertion, yet I did not dare, and during the
whole way my arm served as a girdle (a very close one, I must
confess), without being a moment displaced. Some women that may
read this would be for giving me a box on the ear, and, truly, I
deserved it.
The gayety of the journey, and the chat of these girls, so enlivened
me, that during the whole time we passed together we never ceased
talking a moment. They had set me so thoroughly at ease, that my
tongue spoke as fast as my eyes, though not exactly the same
things. Some minutes, indeed, when I was left alone with either, the
conversation became a little embarrassed, but neither of them was
absent long enough to allow time for explaining the cause.
Arrived at Toune, and myself well dried, we breakfasted together;
after which it was necessary to settle the important business of
preparing dinner. The young ladies cooked, kissing from time to time

the farmer's children, while the poor scullion looked on grumbling.
Provisions had been sent for from town, and there was everything
necessary for a good dinner, but unhappily they had forgotten wine;
this forgetfulness was by no means astonishing to girls who seldom
drank any, but I was sorry for the omission, as I had reckoned on its
help, thinking it might add to my confidence. They were sorry
likewise, and perhaps from the same motive; though I have no
reason to say this, for their lively and charming gayety was
innocence itself; besides, there were two of them, what could they
expect from me? they went everywhere about the neighborhood to
seek for wine, but none could be procured, so pure and sober are
the peasants in those parts. As they were expressing their concern, I
begged them not to give themselves any uneasiness on my account,
for while with them I had no occasion for wine to intoxicate me. This
was the only gallantry I ventured at during the whole of the day, and I
believe the sly rogues saw well enough that I said nothing but the
truth.
We dined in the kitchen; the two friends were seated on the
benches, one on each side the long table, and their guest at the end,
between them, on a three--legged stool. What a dinner! how
charming the remembrance! While we can enjoy, at so small an
expense, such pure, such true delights, why should we be solicitous
for others? Never did those 'petite soupes', so celebrated in Paris,
equal this; I do not only say for real pleasure and gayety, but even
for sensuality.
After dinner, we were economical; instead of drinking the coffee
we had reserved at breakfast, we kept it for an afternoon collation,
with cream, and some cake they had brought with them. To keep our
appetites in play, we went into the orchard, meaning to finish our
dessert with cherries. I got into a tree, throwing them down bunches,
from which they returned the stones through the branches. One time,
Mademoiselle Galley, holding out her apron, and drawing back her
head, stood so fair, and I took such good aim, that I dropped a bunch
into her bosom. On her laughing, I said to myself, "Why are not my
lips cherries? How gladly would I throw them there likewise."
Thus the day passed with the greatest freedom, yet with the
utmost decency; not a single equivocal word, not one attempt at

double-meaning pleasantry; yet this delicacy was not affected, we
only performed the parts our hearts dictated; in short, my modesty,
some will say my folly, was such that the greatest familiarity that
escaped me was once kissing the hand of Mademoiselle Galley; it is
true, the attending circumstances helped to stamp a value on this
trifling favor; we were alone, I was embarrassed, her eyes were fixed
on the ground, and my lips, instead of uttering words, were pressed
on her hand, which she drew gently back after the salute, without
any appearance of displeasure. I know not what I should have said
to her; but her friend entered, and at that moment I thought her ugly.
At length, they bethought themselves, that they must return to
town before night; even now we had but just time to reach it by
daylight; and we hastened our departure in the same order we came.
Had I pleased myself, I should certainly have reversed this order, for
the glance of Mademoiselle Galley had reached my heart, but I
dared not mention it, and the proposal could not reasonably come
from her. On the way, we expressed our sorrow that the day was
over, but far from complaining of the shortness of its duration, we
were conscious of having prolonged it by every possible amusement.
I quitted them in nearly the same spot where I had taken them up.
With what regret did we part! With what pleasure did we form
projects to renew our meeting! Delightful hours, which we passed
innocently together, yet were worth ages of familiarity! The sweet
remembrance of those days cost those amiable girls nothing; the
tender union which reigned among us equalled more lively
pleasures, with which it could not have existed. We loved each other
without shame or mystery, and wished to continue our reciprocal
affection. There is a species of enjoyment connected with innocence
of manners which is superior to any other, because it has no interval;
for myself, the remembrance of such a day touches me nearer,
delights me more, and returns with greater rapture to my heart than
any other pleasure I ever tasted. I hardly knew what I wished with
those charming girls. I do not say: that had the arrangement been in
my power, I should have divided my heart between them; I certainly
felt some degree of preference: though I should have been happy to
have had Mademoiselle de G----, for a mistress, I think, by choice, I
should have liked her, better as a confidante; be that as it may, I felt

on leaving them as though I could not live without either. Who would
have thought that I should never see them more; and that here our
ephemeral amours must end?
Those who read this will not fail to laugh at my gallantries, and
remark, that after very promising preliminaries, my most forward
adventures concluded by a kiss of the hand: yet be not mistaken,
reader, in your estimate of my enjoyments; I have, perhaps, tasted
more real pleasure in my amours, which concluded by a kiss of the
hand, than you will ever have in yours, which, at least, begin there.
Venture, who had gone to bed late the night before, came in soon
after me. I did not now see him with my usual satisfaction, and took
care not to inform him how I had passed the day. The ladies had
spoken of him slightingly, and appeared discontented at finding me
in such bad hands; this hurt him in my esteem; besides, whatever
diverted my ideas from them was at this time disagreeable. However,
he soon brought me back to him and myself, by speaking of the
situation of my affairs, which was too critical to last; for, though I
spent very little, my slender finances were almost exhausted. I was
without resource; no news of Madam de Warrens; not knowing what
would become of me, and feeling a cruel pang at heart to see the
friend of Mademoiselle Galley reduced to beggary.
I now learned from Venture that he had spoken of me to the Judge
Major, and would take me next day to dine with him; that he was a
man who by means of his friends might render me essential service.
In other respects he was a desirable acquaintance, being a man of
wit and letters, of agreeable conversation, one who possessed
talents and loved them in others. After this discourse (mingling the
most serious concerns with the most trifling frivolity) he showed me a
pretty couplet, which came from Paris, on an air in one of Mouret's
operas, which was then playing. Monsieur Simon (the judge major)
was so pleased with this couplet, that he determined to make
another in answer to it, on the same air. He had desired Venture to
write one, and he wished me to make a third, that, as he expressed
it, they might see couplets start up next day like incidents in a comic
romance.
In the night (not being able to sleep) I composed a couplet, as my
first essay in poetry. It was passable; better, or at least composed

with more taste than it would have been the preceding night, the
subject being tenderness, to which my heart was now entirely
disposed. In the morning I showed my performance to Venture, who,
being pleased with the couplet, put it in his pocket, without informing
me whether he had made his. We dined with M. Simon, who treated
us very politely. The conversation was agreeable; indeed it could not
be otherwise between two men of natural good sense, improved by
reading. For me, I acted my proper part, which was to listen without
attempting to join in the conversation. Neither of them mentioned the
couplet nor do I know that it ever passed for mine. M. Simon
appeared satisfied with my behavior; indeed, it was almost all he
saw of me at this interview. We had often met at Madam de Warrens,
but he had never paid much attention to me; it is from this dinner,
therefore, that I date our acquaintance, which, though of no use in
regard to the object I then had in view, was afterwards productive of
advantages which make me recollect it with pleasure. I should be
wrong not to give some account of this person, since from his office
of magistrate, and the reputation of wit on which he piqued himself,
no idea could be formed of it. The judge major, Simon, certainly was
not two feet high; his legs spare, straight, and tolerably long, would
have added something to his stature had they been vertical, but they
stood in the direction of an open pair of compasses. His body was
not only short, but thin, being in every respect of most inconceivable
smallness--when naked he must have appeared like a grasshopper.
His head was of the common size, to which appertained a wellformed face, a noble look, and tolerably fine eyes; in short, it
appeared a borrowed head, stuck on a miserable stump. He might
very well have dispensed with dress, for his large wig alone covered
him from head to foot.
He had two voices, perfectly different, which intermingled
perpetually in his conversation, forming at first a diverting, but
afterwards a very disagreeable contrast. One grave and sonorous,
was, if I may hazard the expression, the voice of his head: the other,
clear, sharp, and piercing, the voice of his body. When he paid
particular attention, and spoke leisurely, so as to preserve his breath,
he could continue his deep tone; but if he was the least animated, or
attempted a lively accent, his voice sounded like the whistling of a

key, and it was with the utmost difficulty that he could return to the
bass.
With the figure I have just described, and which is by no means
overcharged, M. Simon was gallant, ever entertaining the ladies with
soft tales, and carrying the decoration of his person even to foppery.
Willing to make use of every advantage he, during the morning, gave
audience in bed, for when a handsome head was discovered on the
pillow no one could have imagined what belonged to it. This
circumstance gave birth to scenes, which I am certain are yet
remembered by all Annecy.
One morning, when he expected to give audience in bed, or rather
on the bed, having on a handsome night-cap ornamented with rosecolored ribbon, a countryman arriving knocked at the door; the maid
happened to be out; the judge, therefore, hearing the knock
repeated, cried "Come in," and, as he spoke rather loud, it was in his
shrill tone. The man entered, looked about, endeavoring to discover
whence the female voice proceeded and at length seeing a
handsome head-dress set off with ribbons, was about to leave the
room, making the supposed lady a hundred apologies. M. Simon, in
a rage, screamed the more; and the countryman, yet more confirmed
in his opinion, conceiving himself to be insulted, began railing in his
turn, saying that, "Apparently, she was nothing better than a common
streetwalker, and that the judge major should be ashamed of setting
such ill examples." The enraged magistrate, having no other weapon
than the jordan under his bed, was just going to throw it at the poor
fellow's head as his servant returned.
This dwarf, ill-used by nature as to his person, was recompensed
by possessing an understanding naturally agreeable, and which he
had been careful to cultivate. Though he was esteemed a good
lawyer, he did not like his profession, delighting more in the finer
parts of literature, which he studied with success: above all, he
possessed that superficial brilliancy, the art of pleasing in
conversation, even with the ladies. He knew by heart a number of
little stories, which he perfectly well knew how to make the most of;
relating with an air of secrecy, and as an anecdote of yesterday, what
happened sixty years before. He understood music, and could sing
agreeably; in short, for a magistrate, he had many pleasing talents.

By flattering the ladies of Annecy, he became fashionable among
them, appearing continually in their train. He even pretended to
favors, at which they were much amused. A Madam D'Epigny used
to say "The greatest favor he could aspire to, was to kiss a lady on
her knees."
As he was well read, and spoke fluently, his conversation was both
amusing and instructive. When I afterwards took a taste for study, I
cultivated his acquaintance, and found my account in it: when at
Chambery, I frequently went from thence to see him. His praises
increased my emulation, to which he added some good advice
respecting the prosecution of my studies, which I found useful.
Unhappily, this weakly body contained a very feeling soul. Some
years after, he was chagrined by I know not what unlucky affair, but it
cost him his life. This was really unfortunate, for he was a good little
man, whom at a first acquaintance one laughed at, but afterwards
loved. Though our situations in life were very little connected with
each other, as I received some useful lessons from him, I thought
gratitude demanded that I should dedicate a few sentences to his
memory.
As soon as I found myself at liberty, I ran into the street where
Mademoiselle Galley lived, flattering myself that I should see
someone go in or out, or at least open a window, but I was mistaken,
not even a cat appeared, the house remaining as close all the time
as if it had been uninhabited. The street was small and lonely, any
one loitering about was, consequently, more likely to be noticed;
from time to time people passed in and out of the neighborhood; I
was much embarrassed, thinking my person might be known, and
the cause that brought me there conjectured; this idea tortured me,
for I have ever preferred the honor and happiness of those I love to
my own pleasures.
At length, weary of playing the Spanish lover, and having no guitar,
I determined to write to Mademoiselle de G----. I should have
preferred writing to her friend, but did not dare take that liberty, as it
appeared more proper to begin with her to whom I owed the
acquaintance, and with whom I was most familiar. Having written my
letter, I took it to Mademoiselle Giraud, as the young ladies had
agreed at parting, they having furnished me with this expedient.

Mademoiselle Giraud was a quilter, and sometimes worked at
Madam Galley's, which procured her free admission to the house. I
must confess, I was not thoroughly satisfied with this messenger, but
was cautious of starting difficulties, fearing that if I objected to her no
other might be named, and it was impossible to intimate that she had
an inclination to me herself. I even felt humiliated that she should
think I could imagine her of the same sex as those young ladies: in a
word, I accepted her agency rather than none, and availed myself of
it at all events.
At the very first word, Giraud discovered me. I must own this was
not a difficult matter, for if sending a letter to young girls had not
spoken sufficiently plain, my foolish embarrassed air would have
betrayed me. It will easily be supposed that the employment gave
her little satisfaction, she undertook it, however, and performed it
faithfully. The next morning I ran to her house and found an answer
ready for me. How did I hurry away that I might have an opportunity
to read and kiss it alone! though this need not been told, but the plan
adopted by Mademoiselle Giraud (and in which I found more
delicacy and moderation than I had expected) should. She had
sense enough to conclude that her thirty--seven years, hare's eyes,
daubed nose, shrill voice, and black skin, stood no chance against
two elegant young girls, in all the height and bloom of beauty; she
resolved, therefore, nether to betray nor assist them, choosing rather
to lose me entirely than entertain me for them.
As Merceret had not heard from her mistress for some time, she
thought of returning to Fribourg, and the persuasions of Giraud
determined her; nay more, she intimated it was proper someone
should conduct her to her father's and proposed me. As I happened
to be agreeable to little Merceret, she approved the idea, and the
same day they mentioned it to me as a fixed point. Finding nothing
displeasing in the manner they had disposed of me, I consented,
thinking it could not be above a week's journey at most; but Giraud,
who had arranged the whole affair, thought otherwise. It was
necessary to avow the state of my finances, and the conclusion was,
that Merceret should defray my expenses; but to retrench on one
hand what was expended on the other, I advised that her little

baggage should be sent on before, and that we should proceed by
easy journeys on foot.
I am sorry to have so many girls in love with me, but as there is
nothing to be very vain of in the success of these amours, I think I
may tell the truth without scruple. Merceret, younger and less artful
than Giraud, never made me so many advances, but she imitated
my manners, my actions, repeated my words, and showed me all
those little attentions I ought to have had for her. Being very
timorous, she took great care that we should both sleep in the same
chamber; a circumstance that usually produces some consequences
between a lad of twenty and a girl of twenty --five.
For once, however, it went no further; my simplicity being such,
that though Merceret was by no means a disagreeable girl, an idea
of gallantry never entered my head, and even if it had, I was too
great a novice to have profited by it. I could not imagine how two
young persons could bring themselves to sleep together, thinking
that such familiarity must require an age of preparation. If poor
Merceret paid my expenses in hopes of any return, she was terribly
cheated, for we arrived at Fribourg exactly as we had quitted
Annecy.
I passed through Geneva without visiting any one. While going
over the bridges, I found myself so affected that I could scarcely
proceed. Never could I see the walls of that city, never could I enter
it, without feeling my heart sink from excess of tenderness, at the
same time that the image of liberty elevated my soul. The ideas of
equality, union, and gentleness of manners, touched me even to
tears, and inspired me with a lively regret at having forfeited all these
advantages. What an error was I in! but yet how natural! I imagined I
saw all this in my native country, because I bore it in my heart.
It was necessary to pass through Nion: could I do this without
seeing my good father? Had I resolved on doing so, I must
afterwards have died with regret. I left Merceret at the inn, and
ventured to his house. How wrong was I to fear him! On seeing me,
his soul gave way to the parental tenderness with which it was filled.
What tears were mingled with our embraces! He thought I was
returned to him: I related my history, and informed him of my
resolution. He opposed it feebly, mentioning the dangers to which I

exposed myself, and telling me the shortest follies were best, but did
not attempt to keep me by force, in which particular I think he acted
right; but it is certain he did not do everything in his power to detain
me, even by fair means. Whether after the step I had taken, he
thought I ought not to return, or was puzzled at my age to know what
to do with me--I have since found that he conceived a very unjust
opinion of my travelling companion. My step --mother, a good
woman, a little coaxingly put on an appearance of wishing me to stay
to supper; I did not, however, comply, but told them I proposed
remaining longer with them on my return; leaving as a deposit my
little packet, that had come by water, and would have been an
incumbrance, had I taken it with me. I continued my journey the next
morning, well satisfied that I had seen my father, and had taken
courage to do my duty.
We arrived without any accident at Fribourg. Towards the
conclusion of the journey, the politeness of Mademoiselle Merceret
rather diminished, and, after our arrival, she treated me even with
coldness. Her father, who was not in the best circumstances, did not
show me much attention, and I was obliged to lodge at an alehouse.
I went to see them the next morning, and received an invitation to
dine there, which I accepted. We separated without tears at night; I
returned to my paltry lodging, and departed the second day after my
arrival, almost without knowing whither to go to.
This was a circumstance of my life in which Providence offered me
precisely what was necessary to make my days pass happily.
Merceret was a good girl, neither witty, handsome, nor ugly; not very
lively, but tolerably rational, except while under the influence of some
little humors, which usually evaporated in tears, without any violent
outbreak of temper. She had a real inclination for me; I might have
married her without difficulty, and followed her father's business. My
taste for music would have made me love her; I should have settled
at Fribourg, a small town, not pretty, but inhabited by very worthy
people--I should certainly have missed great pleasures, but should
have lived in peace to my last hour, and I must know best what I
should have gained by such a step.
I did not return to Nion, but to Lausanne, wishing to gratify myself
with a view of that beautiful lake which is seen there in its utmost

extent. The greater part of my secret motives have not been so
reasonable. Distant expectation has rarely strength enough to
influence my actions; the uncertainty of the future ever making me
regard projects whose execution requires a length of time as
deceitful lures. I give in to visionary scenes of hope as well as
others, provided they cost nothing, but if attended with any trouble, I
have done with them. The smallest, the most trifling pleasure that is
conveniently within my reach, tempts me more than all the joys of
paradise. I must except, however, those pleasures which are
necessarily followed by pain; I only love those enjoyments which are
unadulterated, which can never be the case where we are conscious
they must be followed by repentance.
It was necessary I should arrive at some place, and the nearest
was best; for having lost my way on the road, I found myself in the
evening at Moudon, where I spent all that remained of my little stock
except ten creuzers, which served to purchase my next day's dinner.
Arriving in the evening at Lausanne, I went into an ale-house,
without a penny in my pocket to pay for my lodging, or knowing what
would become of me. I found myself extremely hungry--setting,
therefore, a good face on the matter, I ordered supper, made my
meal, went to bed without thought and slept with great composure. In
the morning, having breakfasted and reckoned with my host, I
offered to leave my waistcoat in pledge for seven batz, which was
the amount of my expenses. The honest man refused this, saying,
thank Heaven, he had never stripped any one, and would not now
begin for seven batz, adding I should keep my waistcoat and pay
him when I could. I was affected with this unexpected kindness, but
felt it less than I ought to have done, or have since experienced on
the remembrance of it. I did not fail sending him his money, with
thanks, by one I could depend on. Fifteen years after, passing
Lausanne, on my return from Italy, I felt a sensible regret at having
forgotten the name of the landlord and house. I wished to see him,
and should have felt real pleasure in recalling to his memory that
worthy action. Services which doubtless have been much more
important, but rendered with ostentation, have not appeared to me
so worthy of gratitude as the simple unaffected humanity of this
honest man.

As I approached Lausanne, I thought of my distress, and the
means of extricating myself, without appearing in want to my stepmother. I compared myself, in this walking pilgrimage, to my friend
Venture, on his arrival at Annecy, and was so warmed with the idea,
that without recollecting that I had neither his gentility nor his talents,
I determined to act the part of little Venture at Lausanne, to teach
music, which I did not understand, and say I came from Paris, where
I had never been.
In consequence of this noble project (as there was no company
where I could introduce myself without expense, and not choosing to
venture among professional people), I inquired for some little inn,
where I could lodge cheap, and was directed to one named Perrotet,
who took in boarders. This Perrotet, who was one of the best men in
the world, received me very kindly, and after having heard my
feigned story and profession, promised to speak of me, and
endeavored to procure me scholars, saying he should not expect
any money till I had earned it. His price for board, though moderate
in itself, was a great deal to me; he advised me, therefore, to begin
with half board, which consisted of good soup only for dinner, but a
plentiful supper at night. I closed with this proposition, and the poor
Perrotet trusted me with great cheerfulness, sparing, meantime, no
trouble to be useful to me.
Having found so many good people in my youth, why do I find so
few in my age? Is their race extinct? No; but I do not seek them in
the same situation I did formerly, among the commonality, where
violent passions predominate only at intervals, and where nature
speaks her genuine sentiments. In more elevated stations they are
entirely smothered, and under the mask of sentiment, only interest or
vanity is heard.
Having written to my father from Lausanne, he sent my packet and
some excellent advice, of which I should have profited better. I have
already observed that I have moments of inconceivable delirium, in
which I am entirely out of myself. The adventure I am about to relate
is an instance of this: to comprehend how completely my brain was
turned, and to what degree I had 'Venturised' (if I may be allowed the
expression), the many extravagances I ran into at the same time
should be considered. Behold me, then, a singing master, without

knowing how to note a common song; for if the five or six months
passed with Le Maitre had improved me, they could not be supposed
sufficient to qualify me for such an undertaking; besides, being
taught by a master was enough (as I have before observed) to make
me learn ill. Being a Parisian from Geneva, and a Catholic in a
Protestant country, I thought I should change my name with my
religion and country, still approaching as near as possible to the
great model I had in view. He called himself Venture de Villeneuve. I
changed, by anagram, the name Rousseau into that of Vaussore,
calling myself Monsieur Vaussore de Villeneuve. Venture was a good
composer, though he had not said so; without knowing anything of
the art, I boasted of my skill to every one. This was not all: being
presented to Monsieur de Freytorens, professor of law, who loved
music, and who gave concerts at his house, nothing would do but I
must give him a proof of my talents, and accordingly I set about
composing a piece for his concerts, as boldly as if I had really
understood the science. I had the constancy to labor a fortnight at
this curious business, to copy it fair, write out the different parts, and
distribute them with as much assurance as if they had been
masterpieces of harmony; in short (what will hardly be believed,
though strictly true), I tacked a very pretty minuet to the end of it, that
was commonly played about the streets, and which many may
remember from these words, so well known at that time:
Quel caprice!
Quel injustice!
Quio, tu Clarice
Trahiriot tes feux? &'c.
Venture had taught me this air with the bass, set to other words,
by the help of which I had retained it: thus at the end of my
composition, I put this minuet and bass, suppressing the words, and
uttering it for my own as confidently as if I had been speaking to the
inhabitants of the moon. They assembled to perform my piece; I
explain to each the movement, taste of execution, and references to
his part--I was fully occupied. They were five or six minutes
preparing, which were for me so many ages: at length, everything is

adjusted, myself in a conspicuous situation, a fine roll of paper in my
hand, gravely preparing to beat time. I gave four or five strokes with
my paper, attending with "take care!" they begin --No, never since
French operas existed was there such a confused discord! The
minuet, however, presently put all the company in good humor;
hardly was it begun, before I heard bursts of laughter from all parts,
every one congratulated me on my pretty taste for music, declaring
this minuet would make me spoken of, and that I merited the loudest
praise. It is not necessary to describe my uneasiness, or to own how
much I deserved it.
Next day, one of the musicians, named Lutold, came to see me
and was kind enough to congratulate me on my success. The
profound conviction of my folly, shame, regret, and the state of
despair to which I was reduced, with the impossibility of concealing
the cruel agitation of my heart, made me open it to him; giving,
therefore, a loose to my tears, not content with owning my
ignorance, I told all, conjuring him to secrecy; he kept his word, as
every one will suppose. The same evening, all Lausanne knew who I
was, but what is remarkable, no one seemed to know, not even the
good Perrotet, who (notwithstanding what had happened) continued
to lodge and board me.
I led a melancholy life here; the consequences of such an essay
had not rendered Lausanne a very agreeable residence. Scholars
did not present themselves in crowds, not a single female, and not a
person of the city. I had only two or three great dunces, as stupid as I
was ignorant, who fatigued me to death, and in my hands were not
likely to edify much.
At length, I was sent for to a house, where a little serpent of a girl
amused herself by showing me a parcel of music that I could not
read a note of, and which she had the malice to sing before her
master, to teach him how it should be executed; for I was so unable
to read an air at first sight, that in the charming concert I have just
described, I could not possibly follow the execution a moment, or
know whether they played truly what lay before them, and I myself
had composed.
In the midst of so many humiliating circumstances, I had the
pleasing consolation, from time to time, of receiving letters from my

two charming friends. I have ever found the utmost consolatory
virtue in the fair; when in disgrace, nothing softens my affliction more
than to be sensible that an amiable woman is interested for me. This
correspondence ceased soon after, and was never renewed: indeed
it was my own fault, for in changing situations I neglected sending
my address, and forced by necessity to think perpetually of myself, I
soon forgot them.
It is a long time since I mentioned Madam de Warrens, but it
should not be supposed I had forgotten her; never was she a
moment absent from my thoughts. I anxiously wished to find her, not
merely because she was necessary to my subsistence, but because
she was infinitely more necessary to my heart. My attachment to her
(though lively and tender, as it really was) did not prevent my loving
others, but then it was not in the same manner. All equally claimed
my tenderness for their charms, but it was those charms alone I
loved, my passion would not have survived them, while Madam de
Warrens might have become old or ugly without my loving her the
less tenderly. My heart had entirely transmitted to herself the
homage it first paid to her beauty, and whatever change she might
experience, while she remained herself, my sentiments could not
change. I was sensible how much gratitude I owed to her, but in
truth, I never thought of it, and whether she served me or not, it
would ever have been the same thing. I loved her neither from duty,
interest, nor convenience; I loved her because I was born to love her.
During my attachment to another, I own this affection was in some
measure deranged; I did not think so frequently of her, but still with
the same pleasure, and never, in love or otherwise, did I think of her
without feeling that I could expect no true happiness in life while in a
state of separation.
Though in so long a time I had received no news from Madam de
Warrens, I never imagined I had entirely lost her, or that she could
have forgotten me. I said to myself, she will know sooner or later that
I am wandering about, and will find some means to inform me of her
situation: I am certain I shall find her. In the meantime, it was a
pleasure to live in her native country, to walk in the streets where she
had walked, and before the houses that she had lived in; yet all this
was the work of conjecture, for one of my foolish peculiarities was,

not daring to inquire after her, or even pronounce her name without
the most absolute necessity. It seemed in speaking of her that I
declared all I felt, that my lips revealed the secrets of my heart, and
in some degree injured the object of my affection. I believe fear was
likewise mingled with this idea; I dreaded to hear ill of her. Her
management had been much spoken of, and some little of her
conduct in other respects; fearing, therefore, that something might
be said which I did not wish to hear, I preferred being silent on the
subject.
As my scholars did not take up much of my time, and the town
where she was born was not above four leagues from Lausanne, I
made it a walk of three or four days; during which time a most
pleasant emotion never left me. A view of the lake of Geneva and its
admirable banks, had ever, in my idea, a particular attraction which I
cannot describe; not arising merely from the beauty of the prospect,
but something else, I know not why, more interesting, which affects
and softens me. Every time I have approached the Vaudois country I
have experienced an impression composed of the remembrance of
Madam de Warrens, who was born there; of my father, who lived
there; of Miss Vulson, who had been my first love, and of several
pleasant journeys I had made there in my childhood, mingled with
some nameless charm, more powerfully attractive than all the rest.
When that ardent desire for a life of happiness and tranquility (which
ever follows me, and for which I was born) inflames my mind, 'tis
ever to the country of Vaud, near the lake, in those charming plains,
that imagination leads me. An orchard on the banks of that lake, and
no other, is absolutely necessary; a firm friend, an amiable woman, a
cow, and a little boat; nor could I enjoy perfect happiness on earth
without these concomitants. I laugh at the simplicity with which I
have several times gone into that country for the sole purpose of
seeking this imaginary happiness when I was ever surprised to find
the inhabitants, particularly the women, of a quite different
disposition to what I sought. How strange did this appear to me! The
country and people who inhabit it, were never, in my idea, formed for
each other.
Walking along these beautiful banks, on my way to Vevay, I gave
myself up to the soft melancholy; my heart rushed with ardor into a

thousand innocent felicities; melting to tenderness, I sighed and wept
like a child. How often, stopping to weep more at my ease, and
seated on a large stone, did I amuse myself with seeing my tears
drop into the water.
On my arrival at Vevay, I lodged at the Key, and during the two
days I remained there, without any acquaintance, conceived a love
for that city, which has followed me through all my travels, and was
finally the cause that I fixed on this spot, in the novel I afterwards
wrote, for the residence of my hero and heroines. I would say to any
one who has taste and feeling, go to Vevay, visit the surrounding
country, examine the prospects, go on the lake and then say,
whether nature has not designed this country for a Julia, a Clara,
and a St. Preux; but do not seek them there. I now return to my
story.
Giving myself out for a Catholic, I followed without mystery or
scruple the religion I had embraced. On a Sunday, if the weather
was fine, I went to hear mass at Assans, a place two leagues distant
from Lausanne, and generally in company with other Catholics,
particularly a Parisian embroiderer, whose name I have forgotten.
Not such a Parisian as myself, but a real native of Paris, an archParisian from his maker, yet honest as a peasant. He loved his
country so well, that he would not doubt my being his countryman,
for fear he should not have so much occasion to speak of it. The
lieutenant-governor, M. de Crouzas, had a gardener, who was
likewise from Paris, but not so complaisant; he thought the glory of
his country concerned, when any one claimed that honor who was
not really entitled to it; he put questions to me, therefore, with an air
and tone, as if certain to detect me in a falsehood, and once, smiling
malignantly, asked what was remarkable in the 'Marcheneuf'? It may
be supposed I asked the question; but I have since passed twenty
years at Paris, and certainly know that city, yet was the same
question repeated at this day, I should be equally embarrassed to
answer it, and from this embarrassment it might be concluded I had
never been there: thus, even when we meet with truths, we are
subject to build our opinions on circumstances, which may easily
deceive us.

I formed no ideas, while at Lausanne, that were worth recollecting,
nor can I say exactly how long I remained there; I only know that not
finding sufficient to subsist on, I went from thence to Neutchatel,
where I passed the winter. Here I succeeded better, I got some
scholars, and saved enough to pay my good friend Perrotet, who
had faithfully sent my baggage, though at that time I was
considerably in his debt.
By continuing to teach music, I insensibly gained some knowledge
of it. The life I led was sufficiently agreeable, and any reasonable
man might have been satisfied, but my unsettled heart demanded
something more. On Sundays, or whenever I had leisure, I
wandered, sighing and thoughtful, about the adjoining woods, and
when once out of the city never returned before night. One day,
being at Boudry, I went to dine at a public-house, where I saw a man
with a long beard, dressed in a violet-colored Grecian habit, with a
fur cap, and whose air and manner were rather noble. This person
found some difficulty in making himself understood, speaking only an
unintelligible jargon, which bore more resemblance to Italian than
any other language. I understood almost all he said, and I was the
only person present who could do so, for he was obliged to make his
request known to the landlord and others about him by signs. On my
speaking a few words in Italian, which he perfectly understood, he
got up and embraced me with rapture; a connection was soon
formed, and from that moment, I became his interpreter. His dinner
was excellent, mine rather worse than indifferent, he gave me an
invitation to dine with him, which I accepted without much ceremony.
Drinking and chatting soon rendered us familiar, and by the end of
the repast we had all the disposition in the world to become
inseparable companions. He informed me he was a Greek prelate,
and 'Archimandrite' of Jerusalem; that he had undertaken to make a
gathering in Europe for the reestablishment of the Holy Sepulchre,
and showed me some very fine patents from the czarina, the
emperor, and several other sovereigns. He was tolerably content
with what he had collected hitherto, though he had experienced
inconceivable difficulties in Germany; for not understanding a word
of German, Latin, or French, he had been obliged to have recourse
to his Greek, Turkish Lingua Franca, which did not procure him much

in the country he was travelling through; his proposal, therefore, to
me was, that I should accompany him in the quality of secretary and
interpreter. In spite of my violet-colored coat, which accorded well
enough with the proposed employment, he guessed from my meagre
appearance, that I should easily be gained; and he was not
mistaken. The bargain was soon made, I demanded nothing, and he
promised liberally; thus, without any security or knowledge of the
person I was about to serve, I gave myself up entirely to his conduct,
and the next day behold me on an expedition to Jerusalem.
We began our expedition unsuccessfully by the canton of
Fribourg. Episcopal dignity would not suffer him to play the beggar,
or solicit help from private individuals; but we presented his
commission to the Senate, who gave him a trifling sum. From thence
we went to Berne, where we lodged at the Falcon, then a good inn,
and frequented by respectable company; the public table being well
supplied and numerously attended. I had fared indifferently so long,
that I was glad to make myself amends, therefore took care to profit
by the present occasion. My lord, the Archimandrite, was himself an
excellent companion, loved good cheer, was gay, spoke well for
those who understood him, and knew perfectly well how to make the
most of his Grecian erudition. One day, at dessert while cracking
nuts, he cut his finger pretty deeply, and as it bled freely showed it to
the company, saying with a laugh, "Mirate, signori; questo a sangue
Pelasgo."
At Berne, I was not useless to him, nor was my performance so
bad as I had feared: I certainly spoke better and with more
confidence than I could have done for myself. Matters were not
conducted here with the same simplicity as at Fribourg; long and
frequent conferences were necessary with the Premiers of the State,
and the examination of his titles was not the work of a day; at length,
everything being adjusted, he was admitted to an audience by the
Senate; I entered with him as interpreter, and was ordered to speak.
I expected nothing less, for it never entered my mind, that after such
long and frequent conferences with the members, it was necessary
to address the assembly collectively, as if nothing had been said.
Judge my embarrassment!--a man so bashful to speak, not only in
public, but before the whole of the Senate of Berne! to speak

impromptu, without a single moment for recollection; it was enough
to annihilate me--I was not even intimidated. I described distinctly
and clearly the commission of the Archimandrite; extolled the piety of
those princes who had contributed, and to heighten that of their
excellencies by emulation, added that less could not be expected
from their well--known munificence; then, endeavoring to prove that
this good work was equally interesting to all Christians, without
distinction of sect; and concluded by promising the benediction of
Heaven to all those who took part in it. I will not say that my
discourse was the cause of our success, but it was certainly well
received; and on our quitting the Archimandrite was gratified by a
very genteel present, to which some very handsome compliments
were added on the understanding of his secretary; these I had the
agreeable office of interpreting; but could not take courage to render
them literally.
This was the only time in my life that I spoke in public, and before
a sovereign; and the only time, perhaps, that I spoke boldly and well.
What difference in the disposition of the same person. Three years
ago, having been to see my old friend, M. Roguin, at Yverdon, I
received a deputation to thank me for some books I had presented to
the library of that city; the Swiss are great speakers; these
gentlemen, accordingly, made me a long harangue, which I thought
myself obliged in honor to answer, but so embarrassed myself in the
attempt, that my head became confused, I stopped short, and was
laughed at. Though naturally timid, I have sometimes acted with
confidence in my youth, but never in my advanced age: the more I
have seen of the world the less I have been able to adapt its
manners.
On leaving Berne, we went to Soleurre: the Archimandrite
designing to re-enter Germany, and return through Hungary or
Poland to his own country. This would have been a prodigious tour;
but as the contents of his purse rather increased than diminished
during his journey, he was in no haste to return. For me, who was
almost as much pleased on horseback as on foot, I would have
desired no better than to have travelled thus during my whole life;
but it was pre-ordained that my journey should soon end.

The first thing we did after our arrival at Soleurre, was to pay our
respects to the French ambassador there. Unfortunately for my
bishop, this chanced to be the Marquis de Bonac, who had been
ambassador at the Porte, and was acquainted with every particular
relative to the Holy Sepulchre. The Archimandrite had an audience
that lasted about a quarter of an hour, to which I was not admitted,
as the ambassador spoke French and Italian at least as well as
myself. On my Grecian's retiring, I was prepared to follow him, but
was detained: it was now my turn. Having called myself a Parisian,
as such, I was under the jurisdiction of his excellency: he therefore
asked me who I was? exhorting me to tell the truth; this I promised to
do, but entreated a private audience, which was immediately
granted. The ambassador took me to his closet, and shut the door;
there, throwing myself at his feet, I kept my word, nor should I have
said less, had I promised nothing, for a continual wish to unbosom
myself, puts my heart perpetually upon my lips. After having
disclosed myself without reserve to the musician Lutold, there was
no occasion to attempt acting the mysterious with the Marquis de
Bonac, who was so well pleased with my little history, and the
ingenuousness with which I had related it, that he led me to the
ambassadress, and presented me, with an abridgment of my recital.
Madam de Bonac received me kindly, saying, I must not be suffered
to follow that Greek monk. It was accordingly resolved that I should
remain at their hotel till something better could be done for me. I
wished to bid adieu to my poor Archimandrite, for whom I had
conceived an attachment, but was not permitted; they sent him word
that I was to be detained there, and in quarter of an hour after, I saw
my little bundle arrive. M. de la Martiniere, secretary of the embassy,
had in a manner the care of me; while following him to the chamber
appropriated to my use, he said, "This apartment was occupied
under the Count de Luc, by a celebrated man of the same name as
yourself; it is in your power to succeed him in every respect, and
cause it to be said hereafter, Rousseau the First, Rousseau the
Second." This similarity which I did not then expect, would have
been less flattering to my wishes could I have foreseen at what price
I should one day purchase the distinction.

What M. de la Martiniere had said excited my curiosity; I read the
works of the person whose chamber I occupied, and on the strength
of the compliment that had been paid me (imagining I had a taste for
poetry) made my first essay in a cantata in praise of Madam de
Bonac. This inclination was not permanent, though from time to time
I have composed tolerable verses. I think it is a good exercise to
teach elegant turns of expression, and to write well in prose, but
could never find attractions enough in French poetry to give entirely
in to it.
M. de la Martiniere wished to see my style, and asked me to write
the detail I had before made the ambassador; accordingly I wrote
him a long letter, which I have since been informed was preserved
by M. de Marianne, who had long been attached to the Marquis de
Bonac, and has since succeeded M. de Martiniere as secretary to
the embassy of M. de Courtellies.
The experience I began to acquire tended to moderate my
romantic projects; for example, I did not fall in love with Madam de
Bonac, but also felt I did not stand much chance of succeeding in the
service of her husband. M. de la Martiniere was already in the only
place that could have satisfied my ambition, and M. de Marianne in
expectancy: thus my utmost hopes could only aspire to the office of
under secretary, which did not infinitely tempt me: this was the
reason that when consulted on the situation I should like to be
placed in, I expressed a great desire to go to Paris. The ambassador
readily gave in to the idea, which at least tended to disembarrass
him of me. M. de Mervilleux interpreting secretary to the embassy,
said, that his friend, M. Godard, a Swiss colonel, in the service of
France, wanted a person to be with his nephew, who had entered
very young into the service, and made no doubt that I should suit
him. On this idea, so lightly formed, my departure was determined;
and I, who saw a long journey to perform with Paris at the end of it,
was enraptured with the project. They gave me several letters, a
hundred livres to defray the expenses of my journey, accompanied
with some good advice, and thus equipped I departed.
I was a fortnight making the journey, which I may reckon among
the happiest days of my life. I was young, in perfect health, with
plenty of money, and the most brilliant hopes, add to this, I was on

foot, and alone. It may appear strange, I should mention the latter
circumstance as advantageous, if my peculiarity of temper is not
already familiar to the reader. I was continually occupied with a
variety of pleasing chimeras, and never did the warmth of my
imagination produce more magnificent ones. When offered an empty
place in a carriage, or any person accosted me on the road, how
vexed was I to see that fortune overthrown, whose edifice, while
walking, I had taken such pains to rear.
For once my ideas were all martial: I was going to live with a
military man; nay, to become one, for it was concluded I should
begin with being a cadet. I already fancied myself in regimentals,
with a fine white feather nodding on my hat, and my heart was
inflamed by the noble idea. I had some smattering of geometry and
fortification; my uncle was an engineer; I was in a manner a soldier
by inheritance. My short sight, indeed, presented some little
obstacle, but did not by any means discourage me, as I reckoned to
supply that defect by coolness and intrepidity. I had read, too, that
Marshal Schomberg was remarkably shortsighted, and why might
not Marshal Rousseau be the same? My imagination was so warm
by these follies, that it presented nothing but troops, ramparts,
gabions, batteries, and myself in the midst of fire and smoke, an
eyeglass in hand, commanding with the utmost tranquility.
Notwithstanding, when the country presented a delightful prospect,
when I saw charming groves and rivulets, the pleasing sight made
me sigh with regret, and feel, in the midst of all this glory, that my
heart was not formed for such havoc; and soon without knowing
how, I found my thoughts wandering among my dear sheep-folds,
renouncing forever the labor of Mars.
How much did Paris disappoint the idea I had formed of it! The
exterior decorations I had seen at Turin, the beauty of the streets,
the symmetry and regularity of the houses, contributed to this
disappointment, since I concluded that Paris must be infinitely
superior. I had figured to myself a splendid city, beautiful as large, of
the most commanding aspect, whose streets were ranges of
magnificent palaces, composed of marble and gold. On entering the
faubourg St. Marceau, I saw nothing but dirty stinking streets, filthy
black houses, an air of slovenliness and poverty, beggars, carters,

butchers, cries of diet-drink and old hats. This struck me so forcibly,
that all I have since seen of real magnificence in Paris could never
erase this first impression, which has ever given me a particular
disgust to residing in that capital; and I may say, the whole time I
remained there afterwards, was employed in seeking resources
which might enable me to live at a distance from it. This is the
consequence of too lively imagination, which exaggerates even
beyond the voice of fame, and ever expects more than is told. I have
heard Paris so flatteringly described, that I pictured it like the ancient
Babylon, which, perhaps, had I seen, I might have found equally
faulty, and unlike that idea the account had conveyed. The same
thing happened at the Opera-house, to which I hastened the day
after my arrival! I was sensible of the same deficiency at Versailles!
and some time after on viewing the sea. I am convinced this would
ever be the consequence of a too flattering description of any object;
for it is impossible for man, and difficult even for nature herself, to
surpass the riches of my imagination.
By the reception I met with from all those to whom my letters were
addressed, I thought my fortune was certainly made. The person
who received me the least kindly was M. de Surbeck, to whom I had
the warmest recommendation. He had retired from the service, and
lived philosophically at Bagneux, where I waited on him several
times without his offering me even a glass of water. I was better
received by Madam de Merveilleux, sister-in-law to the interpreter,
and by his nephew, who was an officer in the guards. The mother
and son not only received me kindly, but offered me the use of their
table, which favor I frequently accepted during my stay at Paris.
Madam de Merveilleux appeared to have been handsome; her hair
was of a fine black, which, according to the old mode, she wore
curled on the temples. She still retained (what do not perish with a
set of features) the beauties of an amiable mind. She appeared
satisfied with mine, and did all she could to render me service; but
no one seconded her endeavors, and I was presently undeceived in
the great interest they had seemed to take in my affairs. I must,
however, do the French nation the justice to say, they do not so
exhaust themselves with protestations, as some have represented,
and that those they make are usually sincere; but they have a

manner of appearing interested in your affairs, which is more
deceiving than words. The gross compliments of the Swiss can only
impose upon fools; the manners of the French are more seducing,
and at the same time so simple, that you are persuaded they do not
express all they mean to do for you, in order that you may be the
more agreeably surprised. I will say more; they are not false in their
protestations, being naturally zealous to oblige, humane, benevolent,
and even (whatever may be said to the contrary) more sincere than
any other nation; but they are too flighty: in effect they feel the
sentiments they profess for you, but that sentiment flies off as
instantaneously as it was formed. In speaking to you, their whole
attention is employed on you alone, when absent you are forgotten.
Nothing is permanent in their hearts, all is the work of the moment.
Thus I was greatly flattered, but received little service. Colonel
Godard for whose nephew I was recommended, proved to be an
avaricious old wretch, who, on seeing my distress (though he was
immensely rich), wished to have my services for nothing, meaning to
place me with his nephew, rather as a valet without wages than a
tutor. He represented that as I was to be continually engaged with
him, I should be excused from duty, and might live on my cadet's
allowance; that is to say, on the pay of a soldier: hardly would he
consent to give me a uniform, thinking the clothing of the army might
serve. Madam de Merveilleux, provoked at his proposals, persuaded
me not to accept them; her son was of the same opinion; something
else was to be thought on, but no situation was procured. Meantime,
I began to be necessitated; for the hundred livres with which I had
commenced my journey could not last much longer; happily, I
received a small remittance from the ambassador, which was very
serviceable, nor do I think he would have abandoned me had I
possessed more patience; but languishing, waiting, soliciting, are to
me impossible: I was disheartened, displeased, and thus all my
brilliant expectations came once more to nothing. I had not all this
time forgotten my dear Madam de Warrens, but how was I to find
her? Where should I seek her? Madam de Merveilleux, who knew
my story, assisted me in the search, but for a long time unavailingly;
at length, she informed me that Madam de Warrens had set out from
Paris about two months before, but it was not known whether for

Savoy or Turin, and that some conjectured she was gone to
Switzerland. Nothing further was necessary to fix my determination
to follow her, certain that wherever she might be, I stood more
chance of finding her at those places than I could possibly do at
Paris.
Before my departure, I exercised my new poetical talent in an
epistle to Colonel Godard, whom I ridiculed to the utmost of my
abilities. I showed this scribble to Madam de Merveilleux, who,
instead of discouraging me, as she ought to have done, laughed
heartily at my sarcasms, as well as her son, who, I believe, did not
like M. Godard; indeed, it must be confessed, he was a man not
calculated to obtain affection. I was tempted to send him my verses,
and they encouraged me in it; accordingly I made them up in a
parcel directed to him, and there being no post then at Paris by
which I could conveniently send this, I put it in my pocket, and sent it
to him from Auxerre, as I passed through that place. I laugh, even
yet, sometimes, at the grimaces I fancy he made on reading this
panegyric, where he was certainly drawn to the life; it began thus:
Tu croyois, vieux Penard, qu'une folle manie
D'elever ton neveu m'inspireroit l'envie.
This little piece, which, it is true, was but indifferently written; did
not want for salt, and announced a turn for satire; it is,
notwithstanding, the only satirical writing that ever came from my
pen. I have too little hatred in my heart to take advantage of such a
talent; but I believe it may be judged from those controversies, in
which from time to time I have been engaged in my own defence,
that had I been of a vindictive disposition, my adversaries would
rarely have had the laughter on their side.
What I most regret, is not having kept a journal of my travels,
being conscious that a number of interesting details have slipped my
memory; for never did I exist so completely, never live so thoroughly,
never was so much myself, if I dare use the expression, as in those
journeys made on foot. Walking animates and enlivens my spirits; I
can hardly think when in a state of inactivity; my body must be
exercised to make my judgmemt active. The view of a fine country, a

succession of agreeable prospects, a free air, a good appetite, and
the health I gained by walking; the freedom of inns, and the distance
from everything that can make me recollect the dependence of my
situation, conspire to free my soul, and give boldness to my
thoughts, throwing me, in a manner, into the immensity of beings,
where I combine, choose and appropriate them to my fancy, without
constraint or fear. I dispose of all nature as I please; my heart
wandering from object to object, approximates and unites with those
that please it, is surrounded by charming images, and becomes
intoxicated with delicious sensations. If, attempting to render these
permanent, I am amused in describing to myself, what glow of
coloring, what energy of expression, do I give them!--It has been
said, that all these are to be found in my works, though written in the
decline of life. Oh! had those of my early youth been seen, those
made during my travels, composed, but never written!--Why did I not
write them? will be asked; and why should I have written them? I
may answer. Why deprive myself of the actual charm of my
enjoyments to inform others what I enjoyed? What to me were
readers, the public, or all the world, while I was mounting the
empyrean. Besides, did I carry pens, paper and ink with me? Had I
recollected all these, not a thought would have occurred worth
preserving. I do not foresee when I shall have ideas; they come
when they please, and not when I call for them; either they avoid me
altogether, or rushing in crowds, overwhelm me with their force and
number. Ten volumes a day would not suffice barely to enumerate
my thoughts; how then should I find time to write them? In stopping, I
thought of nothing but a hearty dinner; on departing, of nothing but a
charming walk; I felt that a new paradise awaited me at the door, and
eagerly leaped forward to enjoy it.
Never did I experience this so feelingly as in the perambulation I
am now describing. On coming to Paris, I had confined myself to
ideas which related to the situation I expected to occupy there. I had
rushed into the career I was about to run, and should have
completed it with tolerable eclat, but it was not that my heart adhered
to. Some real beings obscured my imagined ones--Colonel Godard
and his nephew could not keep pace with a hero of my disposition.
Thank Heaven, I was soon delivered from all these obstacles, and

could enter at pleasure into the wilderness of chimeras, for that
alone remained before me, and I wandered in it so completely that I
several times lost my way; but this was no misfortune, I would not
have shortened it, for, feeling with regret, as I approached Lyons,
that I must again return to the material world, I should have been
glad never to have arrived there.
One day, among others, having purposely gone out of my way to
take a nearer view of a spot that appeared delightful, I was so
charmed with it, and wandered round it so often, that at length I
completely lost myself, and after several hours' useless walking,
weary, fainting with hunger and thirst, I entered a peasant's hut,
which had not indeed a very promising appearance, but was the only
one I could discover near me. I thought it was here, as at Geneva, or
in Switzerland, where the inhabitants, living at ease, have it in their
power to exercise hospitality. I entreated the countryman to give me
some dinner, offering to pay for it: on which he presented me with
some skimmed milk and coarse barley--bread, saying it was all he
had. I drank the milk with pleasure, and ate the bread, chaff and all;
but it was not very restorative to a man sinking with fatigue. The
countryman, who watched me narrowly, judged the truth of my story
by my appetite, and presently (after having said that he plainly saw I
was an honest, good--natured young man, and did not come to
betray him) opened a little trap door by the side of his kitchen, went
down, and returned a moment after with a good brown loaf of pure
wheat, the remains of a well-flavored ham, and a bottle of wine, the
sight of which rejoiced my heart more than all the rest: he then
prepared a good thick omelet, and I made such a dinner as none but
a walking traveller ever enjoyed.
When I again offered to pay, his inquietude and fears returned; he
not only would have no money, but refused it with the most evident
emotion; and what made this scene more amusing, I could not
imagine the motive of his fear. At length, he pronounced tremblingly
those terrible words, "Commissioners," and "Cellar-rats," which he
explained by giving me to understand that he concealed his wine
because of the excise, and his bread on account of the tax imposed
on it; adding, he should be an undone man, if it was suspected he
was not almost perishing with want. What he said to me on this

subject (of which I had not the smallest idea) made an impression on
my mind that can never be effaced, sowing seeds of that
inextinguishable hatred which has since grow up in my heart against
the vexations these unhappy people suffer, and against their
oppressors. This man, though in easy circumstances, dare not eat
the bread gained by the sweat of his brow, and could only escape
destruction by exhibiting an outward appearance of misery!--I left his
cottage with as much indignation as concern, deploring the fate of
those beautiful countries, where nature has been prodigal of her
gifts, only that they may become the prey of barbarous exactors.
The incident which I have just related, is the only one I have a
distinct remembrance of during this journey: I recollect, indeed, that
on approaching Lyons, I wished to prolong it by going to see the
banks of the Lignon; for among the romances I had read with my
father, Astrea was not forgotten and returned more frequently to my
thoughts than any other. Stopping for some refreshment (while
chatting with my hostess), I inquired the way to Forez, and was
informed that country was an excellent place for mechanics, as there
were many forges, and much iron work done there. This eulogium
instantly calmed my romantic curiosity, for I felt no inclination to seek
Dianas and Sylvanders among a generation of blacksmiths. The
good woman who encouraged me with this piece of information
certainly thought I was a journeyman locksmith.
I had some view in going to Lyons: on my arrival, I went to the
Chasattes, to see Mademoiselle du Chatelet, a friend of Madam de
Warrens, for whom I had brought a letter when I came there with M.
le Maitre, so that it was an acquaintance already formed.
Mademoiselle du Chatelet informed me her friend had passed
through Lyons, but could not tell whether she had gone on to
Piedmont, being uncertain at her departure whether it would not be
necessary to stop in Savoy; but if I choose, she would immediately
write for information, and thought my best plan would be to remain at
Lyons till she received it. I accepted this offer; but did not tell
Mademoiselle du Chatelet how much I was pressed for an answer,
and that my exhausted purse would not permit me to wait long. It
was not an appearance of coolness that withheld me, on the
contrary, I was very kindly received, treated on the footing of equality,

and this took from me the resolution of explaining my circumstances,
for I could not bear to descend from a companion to a miserable
beggar.
I seem to have retained a very connecting remembrance of that
part of my life contained in this book; yet I think I remember, about
the same period, another journey to Lyons, (the particulars of which I
cannot recollect) where I found myself much straitened, and a
confused remembrance of the extremities to which I was reduced
does not contribute to recall the idea agreeably. Had I been like
many others, had I possessed the talent of borrowing and running in
debt at every ale-house I came to, I might have fared better; but in
that my incapacity equalled my repugnance, and to demonstrate the
prevalence of both, it will be sufficient to say, that though I have
passed almost my whole life in indifferent circumstances, and
frequently have been near wanting bread, I was never once asked
for money by a creditor without having it in my power to pay it
instantly; I could never bear to contract clamorous debts, and have
ever preferred suffering to owing.
Being reduced to pass my nights in the streets, may certainly be
called suffering, and this was several times the case at Lyons,
having preferred buying bread with the few pence I had remaining, to
bestowing them on a lodging; as I was convinced there was less
danger of dying for want of sleep than of hunger. What is
astonishing, while in this unhappy situation, I took no care for the
future, was neither uneasy nor melancholy, but patiently waited an
answer to Mademoiselle du Chatelet's letter, and lying in the open
air, stretched on the earth, or on a bench, slept as soundly as if
reposing on a bed of roses. I remember, particularly, to have passed
a most delightful night at some distance from the city, in a road which
had the Rhone, or Soane, I cannot recollect which, on the one side,
and a range of raised gardens, with terraces, on the other. It had
been a very hot day, the evening was delightful, the dew moistened
the fading grass, no wind was stirring, the air was fresh without
chillness, the setting sun had tinged the clouds with a beautiful
crimson, which was again reflected by the water, and the trees that
bordered the terrace were filled with nightingales who were
continually answering each other's songs. I walked along in a kind of

ecstasy, giving up my heart and senses to the enjoyment of so many
delights, and sighing only from a regret of enjoying them alone.
Absorbed in this pleasing reverie, I lengthened my walk till it grew
very late, without perceiving I was tired; at length, however, I
discovered it, and threw myself on the step of a kind of niche, or
false door, in the terrace wall. How charming was the couch! the
trees formed a stately canopy, a nightingale sat directly over me, and
with his soft notes lulled me to rest: how pleasing my repose; my
awaking more so. It was broad day; on opening my eyes I saw the
water, the verdure, and the admirable landscape before me. I arose,
shook off the remains of drowsiness, and finding I was hungry,
retook the way to the city, resolving, with inexpressible gayety, to
spend the two pieces of six francs I had yet remaining in a good
breakfast. I found myself so cheerful that I went all the way singing; I
even remember I sang a cantata of Batistin's called the Baths of
Thomery, which I knew by heart. May a blessing light on the good
Batistin and his good cantata, which procured me a better breakfast
than I had expected, and a still better dinner which I did not expect at
all! In the midst of my singing, I heard some one behind me, and
turning round perceived an Antonine, who followed after and seemed
to listen with pleasure to my song. At length accosting me, he asked,
If I understood music. I answered, "A little," but in a manner to have
it understood I knew a great deal, and as he continued questioning
of me, related a part of my story. He asked me, If I had ever copied
music? I replied, "Often," which was true: I had learned most by
copying. "Well," continued he, "come with me, I can employ you for a
few days, during which time you shall want for nothing; provided you
consent not to quit my room." I acquiesced very willingly, and
followed him.
This Antonine was called M. Rotichon; he loved music, understood
it, and sang in some little concerts with his friends; thus far all was
innocent and right, but apparently this taste had become a furor, part
of which he was obliged to conceal. He conducted me into a
chamber, where I found a great quantity of music: he gave me some
to copy, particularly the cantata he had heard me singing, and which
he was shortly to sing himself.

I remained here three or four days, copying all the time I did not
eat, for never in my life was I so hungry, or better fed. M. Rolichon
brought my provisions himself from the kitchen, and it appeared that
these good priests lived well, at least if every one fared as I did. In
my life, I never took such pleasure in eating, and it must be owned
this good cheer came very opportunely, for I was almost exhausted. I
worked as heartily as I ate, which is saying a great deal; 'tis true I
was not as correct as diligent, for some days after, meeting M.
Rolichon in the street, he informed me there were so many
omissions, repetitions, and transpositions, in the parts I had copied,
that they could not be performed. It must be owned, that in choosing
the profession of music, I hit on that I was least calculated for; yet my
voice was good and I copied neatly; but the fatigue of long works
bewilders me so much, that I spend more time in altering and
scratching out than in pricking down, and if I do not employ the
strictest attention in comparing the several parts, they are sure to fail
in the execution. Thus, through endeavoring to do well, my
performance was very faulty; for aiming at expedition, I did all amiss.
This did not prevent M. Rolichon from treating me well to the last,
and giving me half-a-crown at my departure, which I certainly did not
deserve, and which completely set me up, for a few days after I
received news from Madam de Warrens, who was at Chambery, with
money to defray the expenses of my journey to her, which I
performed with rapture. Since then my finances have frequently
been very low, but never at such an ebb as to reduce me to fasting,
and I mark this period with a heart fully alive to the bounty of
Providence, as the last of my life in which I sustained poverty and
hunger.
I remained at Lyons seven or eight days to wait for some little
commissions with which Madam de Warrens had charged
Mademoiselle du Chatelet, who during this interval I visited more
assiduously than before, having the pleasure of talking with her of
her friend, and being no longer disturbed by the cruel remembrance
of my situation, or painful endeavors to conceal it. Mademoiselle du
Chatelet was neither young nor handsome, but did not want for
elegance; she was easy and obliging while her understanding gave
price to her familiarity. She had a taste for that kind of moral

observation which leads to the knowledge of mankind, and from her
originated that study in myself. She was fond of the works of Le
Sage, particularly Gil Blas, which she lent me, and recommended to
my perusal. I read this performance with pleasure, but my judgment
was not yet ripe enough to relish that sort of reading. I liked
romances which abounded with high-flown sentiments.
Thus did I pass my time at the grate of Mademoiselle du Chatelet,
with as much profit as pleasure. It is certain that the interesting and
sensible conversation of a deserving woman is more proper to form
the understanding of a young man than all the pedantic philosophy
of books. I got acquainted at the Chasattes with some other
boarders and their friends, and among the rest, with a young person
of fourteen, called Mademoiselle Serre, whom I did not much notice
at that time, though I was in love with her eight or nine years
afterwards, and with great reason, for she was a most charming girl.
I was fully occupied with the idea of seeing Madam de Warrens,
and this gave some respite to my chimeras, for finding happiness in
real objects I was the less inclined to seek it in nonentities. I had not
only found her, but also by her means, and near her, an agreeable
situation, having sent me word that she had procured one that would
suit me, and by which I should not be obliged to quit her. I exhausted
all my conjectures in guessing what this occupation could be, but I
must have possessed the art of divination to have hit it on the right. I
had money sufficient to make my journey agreeable: Mademoiselle
du Chatelet persuaded me to hire a horse, but this I could not
consent to, and I was certainly right, for by so doing I should have
lost the pleasure of the last pedestrian expedition I ever made; for I
cannot give that name to those excursions I have frequently taken
about my own neighborhood, while I lived at Motiers.
It is very singular that my imagination never rises so high as when
my situation is least agreeable or cheerful. When everything smiles
around me, I am least amused; my heart cannot confine itself to
realities, cannot embellish, but must create. Real objects strike me
as they really are, my imagination can only decorate ideal ones. If I
would paint the spring, it must be in winter; if describe a beautiful
landscape, it must be while surrounded with walls; and I have said a
hundred times, that were I confined in the Bastile, I could draw the

most enchanting picture of liberty. On my departure from Lyons, I
saw nothing but an agreeable future, the content I now with reason
enjoyed was as great as my discontent had been at leaving Paris,
notwithstanding, I had not during this journey any of those delightful
reveries I then enjoyed. My mind was serene, and that was all; I
drew near the excellent friend I was going to see, my heart
overflowing with tenderness, enjoying in advance, but without
intoxication, the pleasure of living near her; I had always expected
this, and it was as if nothing new had happened. Meantime, I was
anxious about the employment Madam de Warrens had procured
me, as if that alone had been material. My ideas were calm and
peaceable, not ravishing and celestial; every object struck my sight
in its natural form; I observed the surrounding landscape, remarked
the trees, the houses, the springs, deliberated on the cross-roads,
was fearful of losing myself, yet did not do so; in a word, I was no
longer in the empyrean, but precisely where I found myself, or
sometimes perhaps at the end of my journey, never farther.
I am in recounting my travels, as I was in making them, loath to
arrive at the conclusion. My heart beat with joy as I approached my
dear Madam de Warrens, but I went no faster on that account. I love
to walk at my ease, and stop at leisure; a strolling life is necessary to
me: travelling on foot, in a fine country, with fine weather and having
an agreeable object to terminate my journey, is the manner of living
of all others most suited to my taste.
It is already understood what I mean by a fine country; never can a
flat one, though ever so beautiful, appear such in my eyes: I must
have torrents, fir trees, black woods, mountains to climb or descend,
and rugged roads with precipices on either side to alarm me. I
experienced this pleasure in its utmost extent as I approached
Chambery, not far from a mountain which is called Pas de l'Echelle.
Above the main road, which is hewn through the rock, a small river
runs and rushes into fearful chasms, which it appears to have been
millions of ages in forming. The road has been hedged by a parapet
to prevent accidents, which enabled me to contemplate the whole
descent, and gain vertigoes at pleasure; for a great part of my
amusement in these steep rocks, is, they cause a giddiness and
swimming in my head, which I am particularly fond of, provided I am

in safety; leaning, therefore, over the parapet, I remained whole
hours, catching, from time to time, a glance of the froth and blue
water, whose rushing caught my ear, mingled with the cries of
ravens, and other birds of prep that flew from rock to rock, and bush
to bush, at six hundred feet below me. In places where the slope
was tolerably regular, and clear enough from bushes to let stones roll
freely, I went a considerable way to gather them, bringing those I
could but just carry, which I piled on the parapet, and then threw
down one after the other, being transported at seeing them roll,
rebound, and fly into a thousand pieces, before they reached the
bottom of the precipice.
Near Chambery I enjoyed an equal pleasing spectacle, though of
a different kind; the road passing near the foot of the most charming
cascade I ever saw. The water, which is very rapid, shoots from the
top of an excessively steep mountain, falling at such a distance from
its base that you may walk between the cascade and the rock
without any inconvenience; but if not particularly careful it is easy to
be deceived as I was, for the water, falling from such an immense
height, separates, and descends in a rain as fine as dust, and on
approaching too near this cloud, without perceiving it, you may be
wet through in an instant.
At length I arrived at Madam de Warrens; she was not alone, the
intendant-general was with her. Without speaking a word to me, she
caught my hand, and presenting me to him with that natural grace
which charmed all hearts, said: "This, sir, is the poor young man I
mentioned; deign to protect him as long as he deserves it, and I shall
feel no concern for the remainder of his life." Then added,
addressing herself to me, "Child, you now belong to the king, thank
Monsieur the Intendant, who furnishes you with the means of
existence." I stared without answering, without knowing what to think
of all this; rising ambition almost turned my head; I was already
prepared to act the intendant myself. My fortune, however, was not
so brilliant as I had imagined, but it was sufficient to maintain me,
which, as I was situated, was a capital acquisition. I shall now
explain the nature of my employment.
King Victor Amadeus, judging by the event of preceding wars, and
the situation of the ancient patrimony of his fathers, that he should

not long be able to maintain it, wished to drain it beforehand.
Resolving, therefore, to tax the nobility, he ordered a general survey
of the whole country, in order that it might be rendered more equal
and productive. This scheme, which was begun under the father,
was completed by the son: two or three hundred men, part
surveyors, who were called geometricians, and part writers, who
were called secretaries, were employed in this work: among those of
the latter description Madam de Warrens had got me appointed. This
post, without being very lucrative, furnished the means of living
eligibly in that country; the misfortune was, this employment could
not be of any great duration, but it put me in train to procure
something better, as by this means she hoped to insure the
particular protection of the intendant, who might find me some more
settled occupation before this was concluded.
I entered on my new employment a few days after my arrival, and
as there was no great difficulty in the business, soon understood it;
thus, after four or five years of unsettled life, folly, and suffering,
since my departure from Geneva, I began, for the first time, to gain
my bread with credit.
These long details of my early youth must have appeared trifling,
and I am sorry for it: though born a man, in a variety of instances, I
was long a child, and am so yet in many particulars. I did not
promise the public a great personage: I promised to describe myself
as I am, and to know me in my advanced age it was necessary to
have known me in my youth. As, in general, objects that are present
make less impression on me than the bare remembrance of them
(my ideas being all from recollection), the first traits which were
engraven on my mind have distinctly remained: those which have
since been imprinted there, have rather combined with the former
than effaced them. There is a certain, yet varied succession of
affections and ideas, which continue to regulate those that follow
them, and this progression must be known in order to judge rightly of
those they have influenced. I have studied to develop the first
causes, the better to show the concatenation of effects. I would be
able by some means to render my soul transparent to the eyes of the
reader, and for this purpose endeavor to show it in every possible
point of view, to give him every insight, and act in such a manner,

that not a motion should escape him, as by this means he may form
a judgment of the principles that produce them.
Did I take upon myself to decide, and say to the reader, "Such is
my character," he might think that if I did not endeavor to deceive
him, I at least deceived myself; but in, recounting simply all that has
happened to me, all my actions, thoughts, and feelings, I cannot lead
him into an error, unless I do it wilfully, which by this means I could
not easily effect, since it is his province to compare the elements,
and judge of the being they compose: thus the result must be his
work, and if he is then deceived the error will be his own. It is not
sufficient for this purpose that my recitals should be merely faithful,
they must also be minute; it is not for me to judge of the importance
of facts, I ought to declare them simply as they are, and leave the
estimate that is to be formed of them to him. I have adhered to this
principle hitherto, with the most scrupulous exactitude, and shall not
depart from it in the continuation; but the impressions of age are less
lively than those of youth; I began by delineating the latter: should I
recollect the rest with the same precision, the reader, may, perhaps,
become weary and impatient, but I shall not be dissatisfied with my
labor. I have but one thing to apprehend in this undertaking: I do not
dread saying too much, or advancing falsities, but I am fearful of not
saying enough, or concealing truths.

It was, I believe, in
, that I arrived at Chambery, as already
related, and began my employment of registering land for the king. I
was almost twenty-one, my mind well enough formed for my age,
with respect to sense, but very deficient in point of judgment, and
needing every instruction from those into whose hands I fell, to make
me conduct myself with propriety; for a few years' experience had
not been able to cure me radically of my romantic ideas; and
notwithstanding the ills I had sustained, I knew as little of the world,
or mankind, as if I had never purchased instruction. I slept at home,
that is, at the house of Madam de Warrens; but it was not as at
Annecy: here were no gardens, no brook, no landscape; the house
was dark and dismal, and my apartment the most gloomy of the
whole. The prospect a dead wall, an alley instead of a street,
confined air, bad light, small rooms, iron bars, rats, and a rotten floor;
an assemblage of circumstances that do not constitute a very
agreeable habitation; but I was in the same house with my best
friend, incessantly near her, at my desk, or in chamber, so that I
could not perceive the gloominess of my own, or have time to think
of it. It may appear whimsical that she should reside at Chambery on
purpose to live in this disagreeable house; but it was a trait of
contrivance which I ought not to pass over in silence. She had no
great inclination for a journey to Turin, fearing that after the recent
revolutions, and the agitation in which the court yet was, she should
not be very favorably received there; but her affairs seemed to
demand her presence, as she feared being forgotten or ill-treated,
particularly as the Count de Saint-Laurent, Intendent-general of the
Finances, was not in her interest. He had an old house in Chambery,

ill-built, and standing in so disagreeable a situation that it was always
untenanted; she hired, and settled in this house, a plan that
succeeded much better than a journey to Turin would have done, for
her pension was not suppressed, and the Count de Saint-Laurent
was ever after one of her best friends.
Her household was much on the old footing; her faithful Claude
Anet still remained with her. He was, as I have before mentioned, a
peasant of Moutru, who in his childhood had gathered herbs in Jura
for the purpose of making Swiss tea; she had taken him into her
service for his knowledge of drugs, finding it convenient to have a
herbalist among her domestics. Passionately fond of the study of
plants, he became a real botanist, and had he not died young, might
have acquired as much fame in that science as he deserved for
being an honest man. Serious even to gravity, and older than myself,
he was to me a kind of tutor, commanding respect, and preserving
me from a number of follies, for I dared not forget myself before him.
He commanded it likewise from his mistress, who knew his
understanding, uprightness, and inviolable attachment to herself,
and returned it. Claude Anet was of an uncommon temper. I never
encountered a similar disposition: he was slow, deliberate, and
circumspect in his conduct; cold in his manner; laconic and
sententious in his discourse; yet of an impetuosity in his passions,
which (though careful to conceal) preyed upon him inwardly, and
urged him to the only folly he ever committed; that folly, indeed was
terrible, it was poisoning himself. This tragic scene passed soon after
my arrival, and opened my eyes to the intimacy that subsisted
between Claude Anet and his mistress, for had not the information
come from her, I should never have suspected it; yet, surely, if
attachment, fidelity, and zeal, could merit such a recompense, it was
due to him, and what further proves him worthy such a distinction, he
never once abused her confidence. They seldom disputed, and their
disagreements ever ended amicably; one, indeed, was not so
fortunate; his mistress, in a passion, said something affronting, which
not being able to digest, he consulted only with despair, and finding a
bottle of laudanum at hand, drank it off; then went peaceably to bed,
expecting to awake no more. Madam de Warrens herself was
uneasy, agitated, wandering about the house and happily—finding

the phial empty—guessed the rest. Her screams, while flying to his
assistance, alarmed me; she confessed all, implored my help, and
was fortunate enough, after repeated efforts, to make him throw up
the laudanum. Witness of this scene, I could not but wonder at my
stupidity in never having suspected the connection; but Claude Anet
was so discreet, that a more penetrating observer might have been
deceived. Their reconciliation affected me, and added respect to the
esteem I before felt for him. From this time I became, in some
measure, his pupil, nor did I find myself the worse for his instruction.
I could not learn, without pain, that she lived in greater intimacy
with another than with myself: it was a situation I had not even
thought of, but (which was very natural) it hurt me to see another in
possession of it. Nevertheless, instead of feeling any aversion to the
person who had this advantage over me, I found the attachment I felt
for her actually extend to him. I desired her happiness above all
things, and since he was concerned in her plan of felicity, I was
content he should be happy likewise. Meantime he perfectly entered
into the views of his mistress; conceived a sincere friendship for me,
and without affecting the authority his situation might have entitled
him to, he naturally possessed that which his superior judgment
gave him over mine. I dared do nothing he disproved of, but he was
sure to disapprove only what merited disapprobation: thus we lived
in an union which rendered us mutually happy, and which death
alone could dissolve.
One proof of the excellence of this amiable woman's character, is,
that all those who loved her, loved each other; even jealousy and
rivalship submitting to the more powerful sentiment with which she
inspired them, and I never saw any of those who surrounded her
entertain the least ill will among themselves. Let the reader pause a
moment on this encomium, and if he can recollect any other woman
who deserves it, let him attach himself to her, if he would obtain
happiness.
From my arrival at Chambery to my departure for Paris,
,
included an interval of eight or nine years, during which time I have
few adventures to relate; my life being as simple as it was agreeable.
This uniformity was precisely what was most wanting to complete the
formation of my character, which continual troubles had prevented

from acquiring any degree of stability. It was during this pleasing
interval, that my unconnected, unfinished education, gained
consistence, and made me what I have unalterably remained amid
the storms with which I have since been surrounded.
The progress was slow, almost imperceptible, and attended by few
memorable circumstances; yet it deserves to be followed and
investigated.
At first, I was wholly occupied with my business, the constraint of a
desk left little opportunity for other thoughts, the small portion of time
I was at liberty was passed with my dear Madam de Warrens, and
not having leisure to read, I felt no inclination for it; but when my
business (by daily repetition) became familiar, and my mind was less
occupied, study again became necessary, and (as my desires were
ever irritated by any difficulty that opposed the indulgence of them)
might once more have become a passion, as at my master's, had
not other inclinations interposed and diverted it.
Though our occupation did not demand a very profound skill in
arithmetic, it sometimes required enough to puzzle me. To conquer
this difficulty, I purchased books which treated on that science, and
learned well, for I now studied alone. Practical arithmetic extends
further than is usually supposed if you would attain exact precision.
There are operations of extreme length in which I have sometimes
seen good geometricians lose themselves. Reflection, assisted by
practice, gives clear ideas, and enables you to devise shorter
methods, these inventions flatter our self-complacency, while their
exactitude satisfies our understanding, and renders a study pleasant,
which is, of itself, heavy and unentertaining. At length I became so
expert as not to be puzzled by any question that was solvable by
arithmetical calculation; and even now, while everything I formerly
knew fades daily on my memory, this acquirement, in a great
measure remains, through an interval of thirty years. A few days ago,
in a journey I made to Davenport, being with my host at an
arithmetical lesson given his children, I did (with pleasure, and
without errors) a most complicated work. While setting down my
figures, methought I was still at Chambery, still in my days of
happiness—how far had I to look back for them!

The colored plans of our geometricians had given me a taste for
drawing: accordingly I bought colors, and began by attempting
flowers and landscapes. It was unfortunate that I had not talents for
this art, for my inclination was much disposed to it, and while
surrounded with crayons, pencils, and colors, I could have passed
whole months without wishing to leave them. This amusement
engaged me so much that they were obliged to force me from it; and
thus it is with every inclination I give into, it continues to augment, till
at length it becomes so powerful, that I lose sight of everything
except the favorite amusement. Years have not been able to cure
me of that fault, nay, have not even diminished it; for while I am
writing this, behold me, like an old dotard, infatuated with another, to
me useless study, which I do not understand, and which even those
who have devoted their youthful days to the acquisition of, are
constrained to abandon, at the age I am beginning with it.
At that time, the study I am now speaking of would have been well
placed, the opportunity was good, and I had some temptation to
profit by it; for the satisfaction I saw in the eyes of Anet, when he
came home loaded with new discovered plants, set me two or three
times on the point of going to herbalize with him, and I am almost
certain that had I gone once, I should have been caught, and
perhaps at this day might have been an excellent botanist, for I know
no study more congenial to my natural inclination, than that of plants;
the life I have led for these ten years past, in the country, being little
more than a continual herbalizing, though I must confess, without
object, and without improvement; but at the time I am now speaking
of I had no inclination for botany, nay, I even despised, and was
disgusted at the idea, considering it only as a fit study for an
apothecary. Madam de Warrens was fond of it merely for this
purpose, seeking none but common plants to use in her medical
preparations; thus botany, chemistry, and anatomy were confounded
in my idea under the general denomination of medicine, and served
to furnish me with pleasant sarcasms the whole day, which procured
me, from time to time, a box on the ear, applied by Madam de
Warrens. Besides this, a very contrary taste grew up with me, and by
degrees absorbed all others; this was music. I was certainly born for
that science, I loved it from my infancy, and it was the only inclination

I have constantly adhered to; but it is astonishing that what nature
seemed to have designed me for should have cost so much pains to
learn, and that I should acquire it so slowly, that after a whole life
spent in the practice of this art, I could never attain to sing with any
certainty at sight. What rendered the study of music more agreeable
to me at that time, was, being able to practise it with Madam de
Warrens. In other respects our tastes were widely different: this was
a point of coincidence, which I loved to avail myself of. She had no
more objection to this than myself. I knew at that time almost as
much of it as she did, and after two or three efforts, we could make
shift to decipher an air. Sometimes, when I saw her busy at her
furnace, I have said, "Here now is a charming duet, which seems
made for the very purpose of spoiling your drugs;" her answer would
be, "If you make me burn them, I'll make you eat them:" thus
disputing, I drew her to the harpsichord; the furnace was presently
forgotten, the extract of juniper or wormwood calcined (which I
cannot recollect without transport), and these scenes usually ended
by her smearing my face with the remains of them.
It may easily be conjectured that I had plenty of employment to fill
up my leisure hours; one amusement, however, found room, that
was well worth all the rest.

We lived in such a confined dungeon, that it was necessary
sometimes to breathe the open air; Anet, therefore, engaged Madam
de Warrens to hire a garden in the suburbs, both for this purpose
and the convenience of rearing plants, etc.; to this garden was
added a summer—house, which was furnished in the customary
manner; we sometimes dined, and I frequently slept, there.
Insensibly I became attached to this little retreat, decorated it with
books and prints, spending part of my time in ornamenting it during
the absence of Madam de Warrens, that I might surprise her the

more agreeably on her return. Sometimes I quitted this dear friend,
that I might enjoy the uninterrupted pleasure of thinking on her; this
was a caprice I can neither excuse nor fully explain, I only know this
really was the case, and therefore I avow it. I remember Madam de
Luxembourg told me one day in raillery, of a man who used to leave
his mistress that he might enjoy the satisfaction of writing to her; I
answered, I could have been this man; I might have added, That I
had done the very same.
I did not, however, find it necessary to leave Madam de Warrens
that I might love her the more ardently, for I was ever as perfectly
free with her as when alone; an advantage I never enjoyed with any
other person, man or woman, however I might be attached to them;
but she was so often surrounded by company who were far from
pleasing me, that spite and weariness drove me to this asylum,
where I could indulge the idea, without danger of being interrupted
by impertinence. Thus, my time being divided between business,
pleasure, and instruction, my life passed in the most absolute
serenity. Europe was not equally tranquil: France and the emperor
had mutually declared war, the King of Sardinia had entered into the
quarrel, and a French army had filed off into Piedmont to awe the
Milanese. Our division passed through Chambery, and, among
others, the regiment of Champaigne, whose colonel was the Duke
de la Trimouille, to whom I was presented. He promised many
things, but doubtless never more thought of me. Our little garden
was exactly at the end of the suburb by which the troops entered, so
that I could fully satisfy my curiosity in seeing them pass, and I
became as anxious for the success of the war as if it had nearly
concerned me. Till now I had never troubled myself about politics, for
the first time I began reading the gazettes, but with so much partiality
on the side of France, that my heart beat with rapture on its most
trifling advantages, and I was as much afflicted on a reverse of
fortune, as if I had been particularly concerned.
Had this folly been transient, I should not, perhaps, have
mentioned it, but it took such root in my heart (without any
reasonable cause) that when I afterwards acted the anti-despot and
proud republican at Paris, in spite of myself, I felt a secret
predilection for the nation I declared servile, and for that government

I affected to oppose. The pleasantest of all was that, ashamed of an
inclination so contrary to my professed maxims, I dared not own it to
any one, but rallied the French on their defeats, while my heart was
more wounded than their own. I am certainly the first man, that, living
with a people who treated him well, and whom he almost adored, put
on, even in their own country, a borrowed air of despising them; yet
my original inclination is so powerful, constant, disinterested, and
invincible, that even since my quitting that kingdom, since its
government, magistrates, and authors, have outvied each other in
rancor against me, since it has become fashionable to load me with
injustice and abuse, I have not been able to get rid of this folly, but
notwithstanding their ill-treatment, love them in spite of myself.
I long sought the cause of this partiality, but was never able to find
any, except in the occasion that gave it birth. A rising taste for
literature attached me to French books, to their authors, and their
country: at the very moment the French troops were passing
Chambery, I was reading Brantome's 'Celebrated Captains'; my head
was full of the Clissons, Bayards, Lautrecs Colignys, Monlmoreneys,
and Trimouille, and I loved their descendants as the heirs of their
merit and courage. In each regiment that passed by methought I saw
those famous black bands who had formerly done so many noble
exploits in Piedmont; in fine, I applied to these all the ideas I had
gathered from books; my reading continued, which, still drawn from
the same nation, nourished my affection for that country, till, at
length, it became a blind passion, which nothing could overcome. I
have had occasion to remark several times in the course of my
travels, that this impression was not peculiar to me for France, but
was more or less active in every country, for that part of the nation
who were fond of literature, and cultivated learning; and it was this
consideration that balanced in my mind the general hatred which the
conceited air of the French is so apt to inspire. Their romances, more
than their men, attract the women of all countries, and the celebrated
dramatic pieces of France create a fondness in youth for their
theaters; the reputation which that of Paris in particular has acquired,
draws to it crowds of strangers, who return enthusiasts to their own
country: in short, the excellence of their literature captivates the
senses, and in the unfortunate war just ended, I have seen their

authors and philosophers maintain the glory of France, so tarnished
by its warriors.
I was, therefore, an ardent Frenchman; this rendered me a
politician, and I attended in the public square, amid a throng of newsmongers, the arrival of the post, and, sillier than the ass in the fable,
was very uneasy to know whose packsaddle I should next have the
honor to carry, for it was then supposed we should belong to France,
and that Savoy would be exchanged for Milan. I must confess,
however, that I experienced some uneasiness, for had this war
terminated unfortunately for the allies, the pension of Madam de
Warrens would have been in a dangerous situation; nevertheless, I
had great confidence in my good friends, the French, and for once
(in spite of the surprise of M. de Broglio) my confidence was not illfounded—thanks to the King of Sardinia, whom I had never thought
of.
While we were fighting in Italy, they were singing in France: the
operas of Rameau began to make a noise there, and once more
raise the credit of his theoretic works, which, from their obscurity,
were within the compass of very few understandings. By chance I
heard of his 'Treatise on Harmony', and had no rest till I purchased it.
By another chance I fell sick; my illness was inflammatory, short and
violent, but my convalescence was tedious, for I was unable to go
abroad for a whole month. During this time I eagerly ran over my
Treatise on Harmony, but it was so long, so diffuse, and so badly
disposed, that I found it would require a considerable time to unravel
it: accordingly I suspended my inclination, and recreated my sight
with music.
The cantatas of Bernier were what I principally exercised myself
with. These were never out of my mind; I learned four or five by
heart, and among the rest, 'The Sleeping Cupids', which I have
never seen since that time, though I still retain it almost entirely; as
well as 'Cupid Stung by a Bee', a very pretty cantata by Clerambault,
which I learned about the same time.
To complete me, there arrived a young organist from Valdoste,
called the Abbe Palais, a good musician and an agreeable
companion, who performed very well on the harpsichord; I got
acquainted with him, and we soon became inseparable. He had

been brought up by an Italian monk, who was a capital organist. He
explained to me his principles of music, which I compared with
Rameau; my head was filled with accompaniments, concords and
harmony, but as it was necessary to accustom the ear to all this, I
proposed to Madam de Warrens having a little concert once a
month, to which she consented.
Behold me then so full of this concert, that night or day I could
think of nothing else, and it actually employed a great part of my time
to select the music, assemble the musicians, look to the instruments,
and write out the several parts. Madam de Warrens sang; Father
Cato (whom I have before mentioned, and shall have occasion to
speak of again) sang likewise; a dancing—master named Roche,
and his son, played on the violin; Canavas, a Piedmontese musician
(who was employed like myself in the survey, and has since married
at Paris), played on the violoncello; the Abbe Palais performed on
the harpsichord, and I had the honor to conduct the whole. It may be
supposed all this was charming; I cannot say it equalled my concert
at Monsieur de Tretoren's, but certainly it was not far behind it.
This little concert, given by Madam de Warrens, the new convert,
who lived (it was expressed) on the king's charity, made the whole
tribe of devotees murmur, but was a very agreeable amusement to
several worthy people, at the head of whom it would not be easily
surmised that I should place a monk; yet, though a monk, a man of
considerable merit, and even of a very amiable disposition, whose
subsequent misfortunes gave me the most lively concern, and
whose idea, attached to that of my happy days, is yet dear to my
memory. I speak of Father Cato, a Cordelier, who, in conjunction with
the Count d'Ortan, had caused the music of poor Le Maitre to be
seized at Lyons; which action was far from being the brightest trait in
his history. He was a Bachelor of Sorbonne, had lived long in Paris
among the great world, and was particularly caressed by the Marquis
d'Antremont, then Ambassador from Sardinia. He was tall and well
made; full faced, with very fine eyes, and black hair, which formed
natural curls on each side of his forehead. His manner was at once
noble, open, and modest; he presented himself with ease and good
manners, having neither the hypocritical nor impudent behavior of a
monk, or the forward assurance of a fashionable coxcomb, but the

manners of a well-bred man, who, without blushing for his habit, set
a value on himself, and ever felt in his proper situation when in good
company. Though Father Cato was not deeply studied for a doctor,
he was much so for a man of the world, and not being compelled to
show his talents, he brought them forward so advantageously that
they appeared greater than they really were. Having lived much in
the world, he had rather attached himself to agreeable acquirements
than to solid learning; had sense, made verses, spoke well, sang
better, and aided his good voice by playing on the organ and
harpsichord. So many pleasing qualities were not necessary to make
his company sought after, and, accordingly, it was very much so, but
this did not make him neglect the duties of his function: he was
chosen (in spite of his jealous competitors) Definitor of his Province,
or, according to them, one of the greatest pillars of their order.
Father Cato became acquainted with Madam de Warrens at the
Marquis of Antremont's; he had heard of her concerts, wished to
assist at them, and by his company rendered our meetings truly
agreeable. We were soon attached to each other by our mutual taste
for music, which in both was a most lively passion, with this
difference, that he was really a musician, and myself a bungler.
Sometimes assisted by Canavas and the Abbe Palais, we had music
in his apartment; or on holidays at his organ, and frequently dined
with him; for, what was very astonishing in a monk, he was
generous, profuse, and loved good cheer, without the least tincture
of greediness. After our concerts, he always used to stay to supper,
and these evenings passed with the greatest gayety and goodhumor; we conversed with the utmost freedom, and sang duets; I
was perfectly at my ease, had sallies of wit and merriment; Father
Cato was charming, Madam de Warrens adorable, and the Abbe
Palais, with his rough voice, was the butt of the company. Pleasing
moments of sportive youth, how long since have ye fled!
As I shall have no more occasion to speak of poor Father Cato, I
will here conclude in a few words his melancholy history. His brother
monks, jealous, or rather exasperated to discover in him a merit and
elegance of manners which favored nothing of monastic stupidity,
conceived the most violent hatred to him, because he was not as
despicable as themselves; the chiefs, therefore, combined against

this worthy man, and set on the envious rabble of monks, who
otherwise would not have dared to hazard the attack. He received a
thousand indignities; they degraded him from his office, took away
the apartment which he had furnished with elegant simplicity, and, at
length, banished him, I know not whither: in short, these wretches
overwhelmed him with so many evils, that his honest and proud soul
sank under the pressure, and, after having been the delight of the
most amiable societies, he died of grief, on a wretched bed, hid in
some cell or dungeon, lamented by all worthy people of his
acquaintance, who could find no fault in him, except his being a
monk.
Accustomed to this manner of life for some time, I became so
entirely attached to music that I could think of nothing else. I went to
my business with disgust, the necessary confinement and assiduity
appeared an insupportable punishment, which I at length wished to
relinquish, that I might give myself up without reserve to my favorite
amusement. It will be readily believed that this folly met with some
opposition; to give up a creditable employment and fixed salary to
run after uncertain scholars was too giddy a plan to be approved of
by Madam de Warrens, and even supposing my future success
should prove as great as I flattered myself, it was fixing very humble
limits to my ambition to think of reducing myself for life to the
condition of a music-master. She, who formed for me the brightest
projects, and no longer trusted implicitly to the judgment of M.
d'Aubonne, seeing with concern that I was so seriously occupied
with a talent which she thought frivolous, frequently repeated to me
that provincial proverb, which does not hold quite so good in Paris,
"Qui biens chante et biens dance,
fait un metier qui peu avance."
[He who can sweetly sing and featly dance.
His interests right little shall advance.]
On the other hand, she saw me hurried away by this irresistible
passion, my taste for music having become a furor, and it was much
to be feared that my employment, suffering by my distraction, might

draw on me a discharge, which would be worse than a voluntary
resignation. I represented to her; that this employment could not last
long, that it was necessary I should have some permanent means of
subsistence, and that it would be much better to complete by
practice the acquisition of that art to which my inclination led me than
to make fresh essays, which possibly might not succeed, since by
this means, having passed the age most proper for improvement, I
might be left without a single resource for gaining a livelihood: in
short, I extorted her consent more by importunity and caresses than
by any satisfactory reasons. Proud of my success, I immediately ran
to thank M. Coccelli, Director-General of the Survey, as though I had
performed the most heroic action, and quitted my employment
without cause, reason, or pretext, with as much pleasure as I had
accepted it two years before.
This step, ridiculous as it may appear, procured me a kind of
consideration, which I found extremely useful. Some supposed I had
resources which I did not possess; others, seeing me totally given up
to music, judged of my abilities by the sacrifice I had made, and
concluded that with such a passion for the art, I must possess it in a
superior degree. In a nation of blind men, those with one eye are
kings. I passed here for an excellent master, because all the rest
were very bad ones. Possessing taste in singing, and being favored
by my age and figure, I soon procured more scholars than were
sufficient to compensate for the losses of my secretary's pay. It is
certain, that had it been reasonable to consider the pleasure of my
situation only, it was impossible to pass more speedily from one
extreme to the other. At our measuring, I was confined eight hours in
the day to the most unentertaining employment, with yet more
disagreeable company. Shut up in a melancholy counting-house,
empoisoned by the smell and respiration of a number of clowns, the
major part of whom were ill-combed and very dirty, what with
attention, bad air, constraint and weariness, I was sometimes so far
overcome as to occasion a vertigo. Instead of this, behold me
admitted into the fashionable world, sought after in the first houses,
and everywhere received with an air of satisfaction; amiable and gay
young ladies awaiting my arrival, and welcoming me with pleasure; I
see nothing but charming objects, smell nothing but roses and

orange flowers; singing, chatting, laughter, and amusements,
perpetually succeed each other. It must be allowed, that reckoning
all these advantages, no hesitation was necessary in the choice; in
fact, I was so content with mine, that I never once repented it; nor do
I even now, when, free from the irrational motives that influenced me
at that time, I weigh in the scale of reason every action of my life.
This is, perhaps, the only time that, listening to inclination, I was
not deceived in my expectations. The easy access, obliging temper,
and free humor of this country, rendered a commerce with the world
agreeable, and the inclination I then felt for it, proves to me, that if I
have a dislike for society, it is more their fault than mine. It is a pity
the Savoyards are not rich: though, perhaps, it would be a still
greater pity if they were so, for altogether they are the best, the most
sociable people that I know, and if there is a little city in the world
where the pleasures of life are experienced in an agreeable and
friendly commerce, it is at Chambery. The gentry of the province who
assemble there have only sufficient wealth to live and not enough to
spoil them; they cannot give way to ambition, but follow, through
necessity, the counsel of Cyneas, devoting their youth to a military
employment, and returning home to grow old in peace; an
arrangement over which honor and reason equally preside. The
women are handsome, yet do not stand in need of beauty, since they
possess all those qualifications which enhance its value and even
supply the want of it. It is remarkable, that being obliged by my
profession to see a number of young girls, I do not recollect one at
Chambery but what was charming: it will be said I was disposed to
find them so, and perhaps there maybe some truth in the surmise. I
cannot remember my young scholars without pleasure. Why, in
naming the most amiable, cannot I recall them and myself also to
that happy age in which our moments, pleasing as innocent, were
passed with such happiness together? The first was Mademoiselle
de Mallarede, my neighbor, and sister to a pupil of Monsieur Gaime.
She was a fine clear brunette, lively and graceful, without giddiness;
thin as girls of that age usually are; but her bright eyes, fine shape,
and easy air, rendered her sufficiently pleasing with that degree of
plumpness which would have given a heightening to her charms. I
went there of mornings, when she was usually in her dishabille, her

hair carelessly turned up, and, on my arrival, ornamented with a
flower, which was taken off at my departure for her hair to be
dressed. There is nothing I fear so much as a pretty woman in an
elegant dishabille; I should dread them a hundred times less in full
dress. Mademoiselle de Menthon, whom I attended in the afternoon,
was ever so. She made an equally pleasing, but quite different
impression on me. Her hair was flaxen, her person delicate, she was
very timid and extremely fair, had a clear voice, capable of just
modulation, but which she had not courage to employ to its full
extent. She had the mark of a scald on her bosom, which a scanty
piece of blue chenille did not entirely cover, this scar sometimes
drew my attention, though not absolutely on its own account.
Mademoiselle des Challes, another of my neighbors, was a woman
grown, tall, well-formed, jolly, very pleasing though not a beauty, and
might be quoted for her gracefulness, equal temper, and good
humor. Her sister, Madam de Charly, the handsomest woman of
Chambery, did not learn music, but I taught her daughter, who was
yet young, but whose growing beauty promised to equal her
mother's, if she had not unfortunately been a little red-haired. I had
likewise among my scholars a little French lady, whose name I have
forgotten, but who merits a place in my list of preferences. She had
adopted the slow drawling tone of the nuns, in which voice she
would utter some very keen things, which did not in the least appear
to correspond with her manner; but she was indolent, and could not
generally take pains to show her wit, that being a favor she did not
grant to every one. After a month or two of negligent attendance, this
was an expedient she devised to make me more assiduous, for I
could not easily persuade myself to be so. When with my scholars, I
was fond enough of teaching, but could not bear the idea of being
obliged to attend at a particular hour; constraint and subjection in
every shape are to me insupportable, and alone sufficient to make
me hate even pleasure itself.
I had some scholars likewise among the tradespeople, and,
among others, one who was the indirect cause of a change of
relationship, which (as I have promised to declare all) I must relate in
its place. She was the daughter of a grocer, and was called
Mademoiselle de Larnage, a perfect model for a Grecian statue, and

whom I should quote for the handsomest girl I have ever seen, if true
beauty could exist without life or soul. Her indolence, reserve, and
insensibility were inconceivable; it was equally impossible to please
or make her angry, and I am convinced that had any one formed a
design upon her virtue, he might have succeeded, not through her
inclination, but from her stupidity. Her mother, who would run no risk
of this, did not leave her a single moment. In having her taught to
sing and providing a young master, she had hoped to enliven her,
but it all proved ineffectual. While the master was admiring the
daughter, the mother was admiring the master, but this was equally
lost labor. Madam de Larnage added to her natural vivacity that
portion of sprightliness which should have belonged to the daughter.
She was a little, ugly, lively trollop, with small twinkling ferret eyes,
and marked with smallpox. On my arrival in the morning, I always
found my coffee and cream ready, and the mother never failed to
welcome me with a kiss on the lips, which I would willingly have
returned the daughter, to see how she would have received it. All this
was done with such an air of carelessness and simplicity, that even
when M. de Larnage was present; her kisses and caresses were not
omitted. He was a good quiet fellow, the true original of his daughter;
nor did his wife endeavor to deceive him, because there was
absolutely no occasion for it.
I received all these caresses with my usual stupidity, taking them
only for marks of pure friendship, though they were sometimes
troublesome; for the lively Madam Lard was displeased, if, during the
day, I passed the shop without calling; it became necessary,
therefore (when I had no time to spare), to go out of my way through
another street, well knowing it was not so easy to quit her house as
to enter it.
Madam Lard thought so much of me, that I could not avoid
thinking something of her. Her attentions affected me greatly; and I
spoke of them to Madam de Warrens, without supposing any
mystery in the matter, but had there been one I should equally have
divulged it, for to have kept a secret of any kind from her would have
been impossible. My heart lay as open to Madam de Warrens as to
Heaven. She did not understand the matter quite so simply as I had
done, but saw advances where I only discovered friendship. She

concluded that Madam Lard would make a point of not leaving me as
great a fool as she found me, and, some way or other, contrive to
make herself understood; but exclusive of the consideration that it
was not just, that another should undertake the instruction of her
pupil, she had motives more worthy of her, wishing to guard me
against the snares to which my youth and inexperience exposed me.
Meantime, a more dangerous temptation offered which I likewise
escaped, but which proved to her that such a succession of dangers
required every preservative she could possibly apply.
The Countess of Menthon, mother to one of my scholars, was a
woman of great wit, and reckoned to possess, at least, an equal
share of mischief, having (as was reported) caused a number of
quarrels, and, among others, one that terminated fatally for the
house of D' Antremont. Madam de Warrens had seen enough of her
to know her character: for having (very innocently) pleased some
person to whom Madam de Menthon had pretensions, she found her
guilty of the crime of this preference, though Madam de Warrens had
neither sought after nor accepted it, and from that moment
endeavored to play her rival a number of ill turns, none of which
succeeded. I shall relate one of the most whimsical, by way of
specimen.
They were together in the country, with several gentlemen of the
neighborhood, and among the rest the lover in question. Madam de
Menthon took an opportunity to say to one of these gentlemen, that
Madam de Warrens was a prude, that she dressed ill, and
particularly that she covered her neck like a tradeswoman. "O, for
that matter," replied the person she was speaking to (who was fond
of a joke), "she has good reason, for I know she is marked with a
great ugly rat on her bosom, so naturally, that it even appears to be
running." Hatred, as well as love, renders its votaries credulous.
Madam de Menthon resolved to make use of this discovery, and one
day, while Madam de Warrens was at cards with this lady's
ungrateful favorite, she contrived, in passing behind her rival, almost
to overset the chair she sat on, and at the same instant, very
dexterously displaced her handkerchief; but instead of this hideous
rat, the gentleman beheld a far different object, which it was not

more easy to forget than to obtain a sight of, and which by no means
answered the intentions of the lady.
I was not calculated to engross the attention of Madam de
Menthon, who loved to be surrounded by brilliant company;
notwithstanding she bestowed some attention on me, not for the
sake of my person, which she certainly did not regard, but for the
reputation of wit which I had acquired, and which might have
rendered me convenient to her predominant inclination. She had a
very lively passion for ridicule, and loved to write songs and
lampoons on those who displeased her: had she found me
possessed of sufficient talents to aid the fabrication of her verses,
and complaisance enough to do so, we should presently have turned
Chambery upside down; these libels would have been traced to their
source, Madam de Menthon would have saved herself by sacrificing
me, and I should have been cooped up in prison, perhaps, for the
rest of my life, as a recompense for having figured away as the
Apollo of the ladies. Fortunately, nothing of this kind happened;
Madam de Menthon made me stay for dinner two or three days, to
chat with me, and soon found I was too dull for her purpose. I felt this
myself, and was humiliated at the discovery, envying the talents of
my friend Venture; though I should rather have been obliged to my
stupidity for keeping me out of the reach of danger. I remained,
therefore, Madam de Menthon's daughter's singing-master, and
nothing more! but I lived happily, and was ever well received at
Chambery, which was a thousand times more desirable than passing
for a wit with her, and for a serpent with everybody else.
However this might be, Madam de Warrens conceived it
necessary to guard me from the perils of youth by treating me as a
man: this she immediately set about, but in the most extraordinary
manner that any woman, in similar circumstances, ever devised. I all
at once observed that her manner was graver, and her discourse
more moral than usual. To the playful gayety with which she used to
intermingle her instructions suddenly succeeded an uniformity of
manner, neither familiar nor severe, but which seemed to prepare
me for some explanation. After having vainly racked my brain for the
reason of this change, I mentioned it to her; this she had expected
and immediately proposed a walk to our garden the next day.

Accordingly we went there the next morning; she had contrived that
we should remain alone the whole day, which she employed in
preparing me for those favors she meant to bestow; not as another
woman would have done, by toying and folly, but by discourses full
of sentiment and reason, rather tending to instruct than seduce, and
which spoke more to my heart than to my senses. Meantime,
however excellent and to the purpose these discourses might be,
and though far enough from coldness or melancholy, I did not listen
to them with all the attention they merited, nor fix them in my
memory as I should have done at any other time. That air of
preparation which she had adopted gave me a degree of inquietude;
while she spoke (in spite of myself) I was thoughtful and absent,
attending less to what she said than curious to know what she aimed
at; and no sooner had I comprehended her design (which I could not
easily do) than the novelty of the idea, which, during all the years I
had passed with her, had never once entered my imagination, took
such entire possession of me that I was no longer capable of
minding what she said! I only thought of her; I heard her no longer.
Thinking to render young minds attentive to reason by proposing
some highly interesting object as the result of it, is an error
instructors frequently run into, and one which I have not avoided in
my Umilius. The young pupil, struck with the object presented to him,
is occupied only with that, and leaping lightly over your preliminary
discourses, lights at once on the point, to which, in his idea, you lead
him too tediously. To render him attentive, he must be prevented
from seeing the whole of your design; and, in this particular, Madam
de Warrens did not act with sufficient precaution.
By a singularity which adhered to her systematic disposition, she
took the vain precaution of proposing conditions; but the moment I
knew the purchase, I no longer even heard them, but immediately
consented to everything; and I doubt whether there is a man on the
whole earth who would have been sincere or courageous enough to
dispute terms, or one single woman who would have pardoned such
a dispute. By a continuation of the same whimsicality, she attached a
number of the gravest formalities to the acquisition of her favors, and
gave me eight days to think of them, which I assured her I had no
need of, though that assurance was far from a truth: for to complete

this assemblage of singularities, I was very glad to have this
intermission; so much had the novelty of these ideas struck me, and
such disorder did I feel in mine, that it required time to arrange them.
It will be supposed, that these eight days appeared to me as many
ages; on the contrary, I should have been very glad had the time
been lengthened. I find it difficult to describe the state I found myself
in; it was a strange chaos of fear and impatience, dreading what I
desired, and studying some civil pretext to evade my happiness.
Let the warmth of my constitution be remembered, my age, and
my heart intoxicated with love; let my tender attachment to her be
supposed, which, far from having diminished, had daily gained
additional strength; let it be considered that I was only happy when
with her, that my heart was full, not only of her bounty, of her amiable
disposition, but of her shape, of her person, of herself; in a word,
conceive me united to her by every affinity that could possibly render
her dear; nor let it be supposed, that, being ten or twelve years older
than myself, she began to grow an old woman, or was so in my
opinion. From the time the first sight of her had made such an
impression on me, she had really altered very little, and, in my mind,
not at all. To me she was ever charming, and was still thought so by
everyone. She had got something jollier, but had the same fine eyes,
the same clear complexion, the same features, the same beautiful
light hair, the sane gayety, and even the same voice, whose youthful
and silvery sound made so lively an impression on my heart, that,
even to this day, I cannot hear a young woman's voice, that is at all
harmonious, without emotion. It will be seen, that in a more
advanced age, the bare idea of some trifling favors I had to expect
from the person I loved, inflamed me so far, that I could not support,
with any degree of patience, the time necessary to traverse the short
space that separated us; how then, by what miracle, when in the
flower of my youth, had I so little impatience for a happiness I had
never tasted but in idea? How could I see the moment advancing
with more pain than pleasure? Why, instead of transports that should
have intoxicated me with their deliciousness, did I experience only
fears and repugnance? I have no doubt that if I could have avoided
this happiness with any degree of decency, I should have
relinquished it with all my heart. I have promised a number of

extravagancies in the history of my attachment to her; this certainly
is one that no idea could be formed of.
The reader (already disgusted) supposes, that being in the
situation I have before described with Claude Anet, she was already
degraded in my opinion by this participation of her favors, and that a
sentiment of disesteem weakened those she had before inspired me
with; but he is mistaken. 'Tis true that this participation gave me a
cruel uneasiness, as well from a very natural sentiment of delicacy,
as because it appeared unworthy both of her and myself; but as to
my sentiments for her, they were still the same, and I can solemnly
aver, that I never loved her more tenderly than when I felt so little
propensity to avail myself of her condescension. I was too well
acquainted with the chastity of her heart and the iciness of her
constitution, to suppose a moment that the gratification of the senses
had any influence over her; I was well convinced that her only motive
was to guard me from dangers, which appeared otherwise inevitable,
by this extraordinary favor, which she did not consider in the same
light that women usually do; as will presently be explained.
The habit of living a long time innocently together, far from
weakening the first sentiments I felt for her, had contributed to
strengthen them, giving a more lively, a more tender, but at the same
time a less sensual, turn to my affection. Having ever accustomed
myself to call her Mama (as formerly observed) and enjoying the
familiarity of a son, it became natural to consider myself as such,
and I am inclined to think this was the true reason of that insensibility
with a person I so tenderly loved; for I can perfectly recollect that my
emotions on first seeing her, though not more lively, were more
voluptuous: At Annecy I was intoxicated, at Chambery I possessed
my reason. I always loved her as passionately as possible, but I now
loved her more for herself and less on my own account; or, at least, I
rather sought for happiness than pleasure in her company. She was
more to me than a sister, a mother, a friend, or even than a mistress,
and for this very reason she was not a mistress; in a word, I loved
her too much to desire her.
This day, more dreaded than hoped for, at length arrived. I have
before observed, that I promised everything that was required of me,
and I kept my word: my heart confirmed my engagements without

desiring the fruits, though at length I obtained them. Was I happy?
No: I felt I know not what invincible sadness which empoisoned my
happiness, it seemed that I had committed an incest, and two or
three times, pressing her eagerly in my arms, I deluged her bosom
with my tears. On her part, as she had never sought pleasure, she
had not the stings of remorse.
I repeat it, all her failings were the effect of her errors, never of her
passions. She was well born, her heart was pure, her manners
noble, her desires regular and virtuous, her taste delicate; she
seemed formed for that elegant purity of manners which she ever
loved, but never practised, because instead of listening to the
dictates of her heart, she followed those of her reason, which led her
astray: for when once corrupted by false principles it will ever run
counter to its natural sentiments. Unhappily, she piqued herself on
philosophy, and the morals she drew from thence clouded the
genuine purity of her heart.
M. Tavel, her first lover, was also her instructor in this philosophy,
and the principles he instilled into her mind were such as tended to
seduce her. Finding her cold and impregnable on the side of her
passions, and firmly attached to her husband and her duty, he
attacked her by sophisms, endeavoring to prove that the list of duties
she thought so sacred, was but a sort of catechism, fit only for
children. That the kind of infidelity she thought so terrible, was, in
itself, absolutely indifferent; that all the morality of conjugal faith
consisted in opinion, the contentment of husbands being the only
reasonable rule of duty in wives; consequently that concealed
infidelities, doing no injury, could be no crime; in a word, he
persuaded her that the sin consisted only in the scandal, that woman
being really virtuous who took care to appear so. Thus the deceiver
obtained his end in the subverting the reason of a girl; whose heart
he found it impossible to corrupt, and received his punishment in a
devouring jealousy, being persuaded she would treat him as he had
prevailed on her to treat her husband.
I don't know whether he was mistaken in this respect: the Minister
Perret passed for his successor; all I know, is, that the coldness of
temperament which it might have been supposed would have kept
her from embracing this system, in the end prevented her from

renouncing it. She could not conceive how so much importance
should be given to what seemed to have none for her; nor could she
honor with the name of virtue, an abstinence which would have cost
her little.
She did not, therefore, give in to this false principle on her own
account, but for the sake of others; and that from another maxim
almost as false as the former, but more consonant to the generosity
of her disposition.
She was persuaded that nothing could attach a man so truly to
any woman as an unbounded freedom, and though she was only
susceptible of friendship, this friendship was so tender, that she
made use of every means which depended on her to secure the
objects of it, and, which is very extraordinary, almost always
succeeded: for she was so truly amiable, that an increase of intimacy
was sure to discover additional reasons to love and respect her.
Another thing worthy of remark is, that after her first folly, she only
favored the unfortunate. Lovers in a more brilliant station lost their
labor with her, but the man who at first attracted her pity, must have
possessed very few good qualities if in the end he did not obtain her
affection. Even when she made an unworthy choice, far from
proceeding from base inclinations (which were strangers to her noble
heart) it was the effect of a disposition too generous, humane,
compassionate, and sensible, which she did not always govern with
sufficient discernment.
If some false principles misled her, how many admirable ones did
she not possess, which never forsook her! By how many virtues did
she atone for her failings! if we can call by that name errors in which
the senses had so little share. The man who in one particular
deceived her so completely, had given her excellent instructions in a
thousand others; and her passions, being far from turbulent,
permitted her to follow the dictates. She ever acted wisely when her
sophisms did not intervene, and her designs were laudable even in
her failings. False principles might lead her to do ill, but she never
did anything which she conceived to be wrong. She abhorred lying
and duplicity, was just, equitable, humane, disinterested, true to her
word, her friends, and those duties which she conceived to be such;
incapable of hatred or revenge, and not even conceiving there was a

merit in pardoning; in fine (to return to those qualities which were
less excusable), though she did not properly value, she never made
a vile commerce of her favors; she lavished, but never sold them,
though continually reduced to expedients for a subsistence: and I
dare assert, that if Socrates could esteem Aspasia, he would have
respected Madam de Warrens.
I am well aware that ascribing sensibility of heart with coldness of
temperament to the same person, I shall generally, and with great
appearance of reason, be accused of a contradiction. Perhaps
Nature sported or blundered, and this combination ought not to have
existed; I only know it did exist. All those who know Madam de
Warrens (a great number of whom are yet living) have had
opportunities of knowing this was a fact; I dare even aver she had
but one pleasure in the world, which was serving those she loved.
Let every one argue on the point as he pleases, and gravely prove
that this cannot be; my business is to declare the truth, and not to
enforce a belief of it.
I became acquainted with the particulars I have just related, in
those conversations which succeeded our union, and alone rendered
it delicious. She was right when she concluded her complaisance
would be useful to me; I derived great advantages from it in point of
useful instruction. Hitherto she had used me as a child, she now
began to treat me as a man, and entertain me with accounts of
herself. Everything she said was so interesting, and I was so
sensibly touched with it, that, reasoning with myself, I applied these
confidential relations to my own improvement and received more
instruction from them than from her teaching. When we truly feel that
the heart speaks, our own opens to receive its instructions, nor can
all the pompous morality of a pedagogue have half the effect that is
produced by the tender, affectionate, and artless conversation of a
sensible woman on him who loves her.
The intimacy in which I lived with Madam de Warrens, having
placed me more advantageously in her opinion than formerly, she
began to think (notwithstanding my awkward manner) that I
deserved cultivation for the polite world, and that if I could one day
show myself there in an eligible situation, I should soon be able to
make my way. In consequence of this idea, she set about forming

not only my judgment, but my address, endeavoring to render me
amiable, as well as estimable; and if it is true that success in this
world is consistent with strict virtue (which, for my part, I do not
believe), I am certain there is no other road than that she had taken,
and wished to point out to me. For Madam de Warrens knew
mankind, and understood exquisitely well the art of treating all ranks,
without falsehood, and without imprudence, neither deceiving nor
provoking them; but this art was rather in her disposition than her
precepts, she knew better how to practise than explain it, and I was
of all the world the least calculated to become master of such an
attainment; accordingly, the means employed for this purpose were
nearly lost labor, as well as the pains she took to procure me a
fencing and a dancing master.
Though very well made, I could never learn to dance a minuet; for
being plagued with corns, I had acquired a habit of walking on my
heels, which Roche, the dancing master, could never break me of. It
was still worse at the fencing-school, where, after three months'
practice, I made but very little progress, and could never attempt
fencing with any but my master. My wrist was not supple enough, nor
my arm sufficiently firm to retain the foil, whenever he chose to make
it fly out of my hand. Add to this, I had a mortal aversion both to the
art itself and to the person who undertook to teach it to me, nor
should I ever have imagined, that anyone could have been so proud
of the science of sending men out of the world. To bring this vast
genius within the compass of my comprehension, he explained
himself by comparisons drawn from music, which he understood
nothing of. He found striking analogies between a hit in 'quarte' or
'tierce' with the intervals of music which bears those names: when he
made a feint he cried out, "take care of this 'diesis'," because
anciently they called the 'diesis' a feint: and when he had made the
foil fly from my hand, he would add, with a sneer, that this was a
pause: in a word, I never in my life saw a more insupportable pedant.
I made, therefore, but little progress in my exercises, which I
presently quitted from pure disgust; but I succeeded better in an art
of a thousand times more value, namely, that of being content with
my situation, and not desiring one more brilliant, for which I began to
be persuaded that Nature had not designed me. Given up to the

endeavor of rendering Madam de Warrens happy, I was ever best
pleased when in her company, and, notwithstanding my fondness for
music, began to grudge the time I employed in giving lessons to my
scholars.
I am ignorant whether Anet perceived the full extent of our union;
but I am inclined to think he was no stranger to it. He was a young
man of great penetration, and still greater discretion; who never
belied his sentiments, but did not always speak them: without giving
me the least hint that he was acquainted with our intimacy, he
appeared by his conduct to be so; nor did this moderation proceed
from baseness of soul, but, having entered entirely into the principles
of his mistress, he could not reasonably disapprove of the natural
consequences of them. Though as young as herself, he was so
grave and thoughtful, that he looked on us as two children who
required indulgence, and we regarded him as a respectable man,
whose esteem we had to preserve. It was not until after she was
unfaithful to Anet, that I learned the strength of her attachment to
him. She was fully sensible that I only thought, felt, or lived for her;
she let me see, therefore, how much she loved Anet, that I might
love him likewise, and dwell less on her friendship, than on her
esteem, for him, because this was the sentiment that I could most
fully partake of. How often has she affected our hearts and made us
embrace with tears, by assuring us that we were both necessary to
her happiness! Let not women read this with an ill-natured smile;
with the temperament she possessed, this necessity was not
equivocal, it was only that of the heart.
Thus there was established, among us three, a union without
example, perhaps, on the face of the earth. All our wishes, our cares,
our very hearts, were for each other, and absolutely confined to this
little circle. The habit of living together, and living exclusively from the
rest of the world, became so strong, that if at our repasts one of the
three was wanting, or a fourth person came in, everything seemed
deranged; and, notwithstanding our particular attachments, even our
tete—a-tete were less agreeable than our reunion. What banished
every species of constraint from our little community, was a lively
reciprocal confidence, and dulness or insipidity could find no place
among us, because we were always fully employed. Madam de

Warrens always projecting, always busy, left us no time for idleness,
though, indeed, we had each sufficient employment on our own
account. It is my maxim, that idleness is as much the pest of society
as of solitude. Nothing more contracts the mind, or engenders more
tales, mischief, gossiping, and lies, than for people to be eternally
shut up in the same apartment together, and reduced, from the want
of employment, to the necessity of an incessant chat. When every
one is busy (unless you have really something to say), you may
continue silent; but if you have nothing to do, you must absolutely
speak continually, and this, in my mind, is the most burdensome and
the most dangerous constraint. I will go further, and maintain, that to
render company harmless, as well as agreeable, it is necessary, not
only that they should have something to do, but something that
requires a degree of attention.
Knitting, for instance, is absolutely as bad as doing nothing; you
must take as much pains to amuse a woman whose fingers are thus
employed, as if she sat with her arms crossed; but let her embroider,
and it is a different matter; she is then so far busied, that a few
intervals of silence may be borne with. What is most disgusting and
ridiculous, during these intermissions of conversation, is to see,
perhaps, a dozen over-grown fellows, get up, sit down again, walk
backwards and forwards, turn on their heels, play with the chimney
ornaments, and rack their brains to maintain an inexhaustible chain
of words: what a charming occupation! Such people, wherever they
go, must be troublesome both to others and themselves. When I was
at Motiers, I used to employ myself in making laces with my
neighbors, and were I again to mix with the world, I would always
carry a cup-and-ball in my pocket; I should sometimes play with it the
whole day, that I might not be constrained to speak when I had
nothing to discourse about; and I am persuaded, that if every one
would do the same, mankind would be less mischievous, their
company would become more rational, and, in my opinion, a vast
deal more agreeable; in a word, let wits laugh if they please, but I
maintain, that the only practical lesson of morality within the reach of
the present age, is that of the cup-and-ball.
At Chambery they did not give us the trouble of studying
expedients to avoid weariness, when by ourselves, for a troop of

important visitors gave us too much by their company, to feel any
when alone. The annoyance they formerly gave me had not
diminished; all the difference was, that I now found less opportunity
to abandon myself to my dissatisfaction. Poor Madam de Warrens
had not lost her old predilection for schemes and systems; on the
contrary, the more she felt the pressure of her domestic necessities,
the more she endeavored to extricate herself from them by visionary
projects; and, in proportion to the decrease of her present resources,
she contrived to enlarge, in idea, those of the future. Increase of
years only strengthened this folly: as she lost her relish for the
pleasures of the world and youth, she replaced it by an additional
fondness for secrets and projects; her house was never clear of
quacks, contrivers of new manufactures, alchemists, projects of all
kinds and of all descriptions, whose discourses began by a
distribution of millions and concluded by giving you to understand
that they were in want of a crown—piece. No one went from her
empty-handed; and what astonished me most was, how she could
so long support such profusion, without exhausting the source or
wearying her creditors.
Her principal project at the time I am now speaking of was that of
establishing a Royal Physical Garden at Chambery, with a
Demonstrator attached to it; it will be unnecessary to add for whom
this office was designed. The situation of this city, in the midst of the
Alps, was extremely favorable to botany, and as Madam de Warrens
was always for helping out one project with another, a College of
Pharmacy was to be added, which really would have been a very
useful foundation in so poor a country, where apothecaries are
almost the only medical practitioners. The retreat of the chief
physician, Grossi, to Chambery, on the demise of King Victor,
seemed to favor this idea, or perhaps, first suggest it; however this
may be, by flattery and attention she set about managing Grossi,
who, in fact, was not very manageable, being the most caustic and
brutal, for a man who had any pretensions to the quality of a
gentleman, that ever I knew. The reader may judge for himself by
two or three traits of character, which I shall add by way of specimen.
He assisted one day at a consultation with some other doctors,
and among the rest, a young gentleman from Annecy, who was

physician in ordinary to the sick person. This young man, being but
indifferently taught for a doctor, was bold enough to differ in opinion
from M. Grossi, who only answered him by asking him when he
should return, which way he meant to take, and what conveyance he
should make use of? The other, having satisfied Grossi in these
particulars, asked him if there was anything he could serve him in?
"Nothing, nothing," answered he, "only I shall place myself at a
window in your way, that I may have the pleasure of seeing an ass
ride on horseback." His avarice equalled his riches and want of
feeling. One of his friends wanted to borrow some money of him, on
good security. "My friend," answered he, shaking him by the arm,
and grinding his teeth, "Should St. Peter descend from heaven to
borrow ten pistoles of me, and offer the Trinity as securities, I would
not lend them." One day, being invited to dinner with Count Picon,
Governor of Savoy, who was very religious, he arrived before it was
ready, and found his excellency busy with his devotions, who
proposed to him the same employment; not knowing how to refuse,
he knelt down with a frightful grimace, but had hardly recited two
Ave-Marias, when, not being able to contain himself any longer, he
rose hastily, snatched his hat and cane, and without speaking a
word, was making toward the door; Count Picon ran after him,
crying, "Monsieur Grossi! Monsieur Grossi! stop, there's a most
excellent ortolan on the spit for you." "Monsieur le Count," replied the
other, turning his head, "though you should give me a roasted angel,
I would not stay." Such was M. Grossi, whom Madam de Warrens
undertook and succeeded in civilizing. Though his time was very
much occupied, he accustomed himself to come frequently to her
house, conceived a friendship for Anet, seemed to think him
intelligent, spoke of him with esteem, and, what would not have been
expected of such a brute, affected to treat him with respect, wishing
to efface the impressions of the past; for though Anet was no longer
on the footing of a domestic, it was known that he had been one, and
nothing less than the countenance and example of the chief
physician was necessary to set an example of respect which would
not otherwise have been paid him. Thus Claude Anet, with a black
coat, a well-dressed wig, a grave, decent behavior, a circumspect
conduct, and a tolerable knowledge in medical and botanical

matters, might reasonably have hoped to fill, with universal
satisfaction, the place of public demonstrator, had the proposed
establishment taken place. Grossi highly approved the plan, and only
waited an opportunity to propose it to the administration, whenever a
return of peace should permit them to think of useful institutions, and
enable them to spare the necessary pecuniary supplies.
But this project, whose execution would probably have plunged
me into botanical studies, for which I am inclined to think Nature
designed me, failed through one of those unexpected strokes which
frequently overthrow the best concerted plans. I was destined to
become an example of human misery; and it might be said that
Providence, who called me by degrees to these extraordinary trials,
disconcerted every opportunity that could prevent my encountering
them.
In an excursion which Anet made to the top of the mountain to
seek for genipi, a scarce plant that grows only on the Alps, and
which Monsieur Grossi had occasion for, unfortunately he heated
himself so much, that he was seized with a pleurisy, which the genipi
could not relieve, though said to be specific in that disorder; and,
notwithstanding all the art of Grossi (who certainly was very skillful),
and all the care of his good mistress and myself, he died the fifth day
of his disorder, in the most cruel agonies. During his illness he had
no exhortations but mine, bestowed with such transports of grief and
zeal, that had he been in a state to understand them, they must have
been some consolation to him. Thus I lost the firmest friend I ever
had; a man estimable and extraordinary; in whom Nature supplied
the defects of education, and who (though in a state of servitude)
possessed all the virtues necessary to form a great man, which,
perhaps, he would have shown himself, and been acknowledged,
had he lived to fill the situation he seemed so perfectly adapted to.
The next day I spoke of him to Madam de Warrens with the most
sincere and lively affection; when, suddenly, in the midst of our
conversation, the vile, ungrateful thought occurred, that I should
inherit his wardrobe, and particularly a handsome black coat, which I
thought very becoming. As I thought this, I consequently uttered it;
for when with her, to think and to speak was the same thing. Nothing
could have made her feel more forcibly the loss she had sustained,

than this unworthy and odious observation; disinterestedness and
greatness of soul being qualities that poor Anet had eminently
possessed. The generous Madam de Warrens turned from me, and
(without any reply) burst into tears. Dear and precious tears! your
reprehension was fully felt; ye ran into my very heart, washing from
thence even the smallest traces of such despicable and unworthy
sentiments, never to return.
This loss caused Madam de Warrens as much inconvenience as
sorrow, since from this moment her affairs were still more deranged.
Anet was extremely exact, and kept everything in order; his vigilance
was universally feared, and this set some bounds to that profusion
they were too apt to run into; even Madam de Warrens, to avoid his
censure, kept her dissipation within bounds; his attachment was not
sufficient, she wished to preserve his esteem, and avoid the just
remonstrances he sometimes took the liberty to make her, by
representing that she squandered the property of others as well as
her own. I thought as he did, nay, I even sometimes expressed
myself to the same effect, but had not an equal ascendancy over
her, and my advice did not make the same impression. On his
decease, I was obliged to occupy his place, for which I had as little
inclination as abilities, and therefore filled it ill. I was not sufficiently
careful, and so very timid, that though I frequently found fault to
myself, I saw ill-management without taking courage to oppose it;
besides, though I acquired an equal share of respect, I had not the
same authority. I saw the disorder that prevailed, trembled at it,
sometimes complained, but was never attended to. I was too young
and lively to have any pretensions to the exercise of reason, and
when I would have acted the reformer, Madam de Warrens calling
me her little Mentor, with two or three playful slaps on the cheek,
reduced me to my natural thoughtlessness. Notwithstanding, an idea
of the certain distress in which her ill-regulated expenses, sooner or
later, must necessarily plunge her, made a stronger impression on
me since I had become the inspector of her household, and had a
better opportunity of calculating the inequality that subsisted
between her income and her expenses. I even date from this period
the beginning of that inclination to avarice which I have ever since
been sensible of. I was never foolishly prodigal, except by intervals;

but till then I was never concerned whether I had much or little
money. I now began to pay more attention to this circumstance,
taking care of my purse, and becoming mean from a laudable
motive; for I only sought to insure Madam de Warrens some
resources against that catastrophe which I dreaded the approach of.
I feared her creditors would seize her pension or that it might be
discontinued and she reduced to want, when I foolishly imagined that
the trifle I could save might be of essential service to her; but to
accomplish this, it was necessary I should conceal what I meant to
make a reserve of; for it would have been an awkward circumstance,
while she was perpetually driven to expedients, to have her know
that I hoarded money. Accordingly, I sought out some hiding-place,
where I laid up a few louis, resolving to augment this stock from time
to time, till a convenient opportunity to lay it at her feet; but I was so
incautious in the choice of my repositories, that she always
discovered them, and, to convince me that she did so, changed the
louis I had concealed for a larger sum in different pieces of coin.
Ashamed of these discoveries, I brought back to the common purse
my little treasure, which she never failed to lay out in clothes, or
other things for my use, such as a silver hilted sword, watch, etc.
Being convinced that I should never succeed in accumulating
money, and that what I could save would furnish but a very slender
resource against the misfortune I dreaded, made me wish to place
myself in such a situation that I might be enabled to provide for her,
whenever she might chance to be reduced to want. Unhappily,
seeking these resources on the side of my inclinations, I foolishly
determined to consider music as my principal dependence; and
ideas of harmony rising in my brain, I imagined, that if placed in a
proper situation to profit by them, I should acquire celebrity, and
presently become a modern Orpheus, whose mystic sounds would
attract all the riches of Peru.
As I began to read music tolerably well, the question was, how I
should learn composition? The difficulty lay in meeting with a good
master, for, with the assistance of my Rameau alone, I despaired of
ever being able to accomplish it; and, since the departure of M. le
Maitre, there was nobody in Savoy who understood anything of the
principles of harmony.

I am now about to relate another of those inconsequences, which
my life is full of, and which have so frequently carried me directly
from my designs, even when I thought myself immediately within
reach of them. Venture had spoken to me in very high terms of the
Abbe Blanchard, who had taught him composition; a deserving man,
possessed of great talents, who was music-master to the cathedral
at Besancon, and is now in that capacity at the Chapel of Versailles.
I therefore determined to go to Besancon, and take some lessons
from the Abbe Blanchard, and the idea appeared so rational to me,
that I soon made Madam de Warrens of the same opinion, who
immediately set about the preparations for my journey, in the same
style of profusion with which all her plans were executed. Thus this
project for preventing a bankruptcy, and repairing in future the waste
of dissipation, began by causing her to expend eight hundred livres;
her ruin being accelerated that I might be put in a condition to
prevent it. Foolish as this conduct may appear, the illusion was
complete on my part, and even on hers, for I was persuaded I should
labor for her emolument, and she thought she was highly promoting
mine.
I expected to find Venture still at Annecy, and promised myself to
obtain a recommendatory letter from him to the Abbe Blanchard; but
he had left that place, and I was obliged to content myself in the
room of it, with a mass in four parts of his composition, which he had
left with me. With this slender recommendation I set out for
Besancon by the way of Geneva, where I saw my relations; and
through Nion, where I saw my father, who received me in his usual
manner, and promised to forward my portmanteau, which, as I
travelled on horseback, came after me. I arrived at Besancon, and
was kindly received by the Abbe Blanchard, who promised me his
instruction, and offered his services in any other particular. We had
just set about our music, when I received a letter from my father,
informing me that my portmanteau had been seized and confiscated
at Rousses, a French barrier on the side of Switzerland. Alarmed at
the news, I employed the acquaintance I had formed at Besancon, to
learn the motive of this confiscation. Being certain there was nothing
contraband among my baggage, I could not conceive on what
pretext it could have been seized on; at length, however, I learned

the rights of the story, which (as it is a very curious one) must not be
omitted.
I became acquainted at Chambery with a very worthy old man,
from Lyons, named Monsieur Duvivier, who had been employed at
the Visa, under the regency, and for want of other business, now
assisted at the Survey. He had lived in the polite world, possessed
talents, was good-humored, and understood music. As we both
wrote in the same chamber, we preferred each other's acquaintance
to that of the unlicked cubs that surrounded us. He had some
correspondents at Paris, who furnished him with those little nothings,
those daily novelties, which circulate one knows not why, and die
one cares not when, without any one thinking of them longer than
they are heard. As I sometimes took him to dine with Madam de
Warrens, he in some measure treated me with respect, and (wishing
to render himself agreeable) endeavored to make me fond of these
trifles, for which I naturally had such a distaste, that I never in my life
read any of them. Unhappily one of these cursed papers happened
to be in the waistcoat pocket of a new suit, which I had only worn two
or three times to prevent its being seized by the commissioners of
the customs. This paper contained an insipid Jansenist parody on
that beautiful scene in Racine's Mithridates: I had not read ten lines
of it, but by forgetfulness left it in my pocket, and this caused all my
necessaries to be confiscated. The commissioners at the head of the
inventory of my portmanteau, set a most pompous verbal process, in
which it was taken for granted that this most terrible writing came
from Geneva for the sole purpose of being printed and distributed in
France, and then ran into holy invectives against the enemies of God
and the Church, and praised the pious vigilance of those who had
prevented the execution of these most infernal machinations. They
doubtless found also that my spirits smelt of heresy, for on the
strength of this dreadful paper, they were all seized, and from that
time I never received any account of my unfortunate portmanteau.
The revenue officers whom I applied to for this purpose required so
many instructions, informations, certificates, memorials, etc., etc.,
that, lost a thousand times in the perplexing labyrinth, I was glad to
abandon them entirely. I feel a real regret for not having preserved
this verbal process from the office of Rousses, for it was a piece

calculated to hold a distinguished rank in the collection which is to
accompany this Work.
The loss of my necessities immediately brought me back to
Chambery, without having learned anything of the Abbe Blanchard.
Reasoning with myself on the events of this journey, and seeing that
misfortunes attended all my enterprises, I resolved to attach myself
entirely to Madam de Warrens, to share her fortune, and distress
myself no longer about future events, which I could not regulate. She
received me as if I had brought back treasures, replaced by degrees
my little wardrobe, and though this misfortune fell heavy enough on
us both, it was forgotten almost as suddenly as it arrived.
Though this mischance had rather dampened my musical ardor, I
did not leave off studying my Rameau, and, by repeated efforts, was
at length able to understand it, and to make some little attempts at
composition, the success of which encouraged me to proceed. The
Count de Bellegrade, son of the Marquis of Antremont, had returned
from Dresden after the death of King Augustus. Having long resided
at Paris, he was fond of music, and particularly that of Rameau. His
brother, the Count of Nangis, played on the violin; the Countess la
Tour, their sister, sung tolerably: this rendered music the fashion at
Chambery, and a kind of public concert was established there, the
direction of which was at first designed for me, but they soon
discovered I was not competent to the undertaking, and it was
otherwise arranged. Notwithstanding this, I continued writing a
number of little pieces, in my own way, and, among others, a
cantata, which gained great approbation; it could not, indeed, be
called a finished piece, but the airs were written in a style of novelty,
and produced a good effect, which was not expected from me.
These gentlemen could not believe that, reading music so
indifferently, it was possible I should compose any that was
passable, and made no doubt that I had taken to myself the credit of
some other person's labors. Monsieur de Nangis, wishing to be
assured of this, called on me one morning with a cantata of
Clerambault's which he had transposed as he said, to suit his voice,
and to which another bass was necessary, the transposition having
rendered that of Clerambault impracticable. I answered, it required
considerable labor, and could not be done on the spot. Being

convinced I only sought an excuse, he pressed me to write at least
the bass to a recitative: I did so, not well, doubtless, because to
attempt anything with success I must have both time and freedom,
but I did it at least according to rule, and he being present, could not
doubt but I understood the elements of composition. I did not,
therefore, lose my scholars, though it hurt my pride that there should
be a concert at Chambery in which I was not necessary.
About this time, peace being concluded, the French army
repassed the Alps. Several officers came to visit Madam de
Warrens, and among others the Count de Lautrec, Colonel of the
regiment of Orleans, since Plenipotentiary of Geneva, and
afterwards Marshal of France, to whom she presented me. On her
recommendation, he appeared to interest himself greatly in my
behalf, promising a great deal, which he never remembered till the
last year of his life, when I no longer stood in need of his assistance.
The young Marquis of Sennecterre, whose father was then
ambassador at Turin, passed through Chambery at the same time,
and dined one day at M. de Menthon's, when I happened to be
among the guests. After dinner; the discourse turned on music,
which the marquis understood extremely well. The opera of 'Jephtha'
was then new; he mentioned this piece, it was brought him, and he
made me tremble by proposing to execute it between us. He opened
the book at that celebrated double chorus,
La Terra, l'Enfer, le Ciel meme,
Tout tremble devant le Seigneur!
[The Earth, and Hell, and Heaven itself,
tremble before the Lord!]
He said, "How many parts will you take? I will do these six." I had
not yet been accustomed to this trait of French vivacity, and though
acquainted with divisions, could not comprehend how one man could
undertake to perform six, or even two parts at the same time.
Nothing has cost me more trouble in music than to skip lightly from
one part to another, and have the eye at once on a whole division.
By the manner in which I evaded this trial, he must have been

inclined to believe I did not understand music, and perhaps it was to
satisfy himself in this particular that he proposed my noting a song
for Mademoiselle de Menthon, in such a manner that I could not
avoid it. He sang this song, and I wrote from his voice, without giving
him much trouble to repeat it. When finished he read my
performance, and said (which was very true) that it was very
correctly noted. He had observed my embarrassment, and now
seemed to enhance the merit of this little success. In reality, I then
understood music very well, and only wanted that quickness at first
sight which I possess in no one particular, and which is only to be
acquired in this art by long and constant practice. Be that as it may, I
was fully sensible of his kindness in endeavoring to efface from the
minds of others, and even from my own, the embarrassment I had
experienced on this occasion. Twelve or fifteen years afterwards,
meeting this gentleman at several houses in Paris, I was tempted to
make him recollect this anecdote, and show him I still remembered
it; but he had lost his sight since that time; I feared to give him pain
by recalling to his memory how useful it formerly had been to him,
and was therefore silent on that subject.
I now touch on the moment that binds my past existence to the
present, some friendships of that period, prolonged to the present
time, being very dear to me, have frequently made me regret that
happy obscurity, when those who called themselves my friends were
really so; loved me for myself, through pure good will, and not from
the vanity of being acquainted with a conspicuous character,
perhaps for the secret purpose of finding more occasions to injure
him.
From this time I date my first acquaintance with my old friend
Gauffecourt, who, notwithstanding every effort to disunite us, has still
remained so.—Still remained so!—No, alas! I have just lost him!—
but his affection terminated only with his life—death alone could put
a period to our friendship. Monsieur de Gauffecourt was one of the
most amiable men that ever existed; it was impossible to see him
without affection, or to live with him without feeling a sincere
attachment. In my life I never saw features more expressive of
goodness and serenity, or that marked more feeling, more
understanding, or inspired greater confidence. However reserved

one might be, it was impossible even at first sight to avoid being as
free with him as if he had been an acquaintance of twenty years; for
myself, who find so much difficulty to be at ease among new faces, I
was familiar with him in a moment. His manner, accent, and
conversation, perfectly suited his features: the sound of his voice
was clear, full and musical; it was an agreeable and expressive bass,
which satisfied the ear, and sounded full upon the heart. It was
impossible to possess a more equal and pleasing vivacity, or more
real and unaffected gracefulness, more natural talents, or cultivated
with greater taste; join to all these good qualities an affectionate
heart, but loving rather too diffusively, and bestowing his favors with
too little caution; serving his friends with zeal, or rather making
himself the friend of every one he could serve, yet contriving very
dexterously to manage his own affairs, while warmly pursuing the
interests of others.
Gauffecourt was the son of a clock-maker, and would have been a
clock-maker himself had not his person and desert called him to a
superior situation. He became acquainted with M. de la Closure, the
French Resident at Geneva, who conceived a friendship for him, and
procured him some connections at Paris, which were useful, and
through whose influence he obtained the privilege of furnishing the
salts of Valais, which was worth twenty thousand livres a year. This
very amply satisfied his wishes with respect to fortune, but with
regard to women he was more difficult; he had to provide for his own
happiness, and did what he supposed most conducive to it. What
renders his character most remarkable, and does him the greatest
honor, is, that though connected with all conditions, he was
universally esteemed and sought after without being envied or hated
by any one, and I really believe he passed through life without a
single enemy.—Happy man!
He went every year to the baths of Aix, where the best company
from the neighboring countries resorted, and being on terms of
friendship with all the nobility of Savoy, came from Aix to Chambery
to see the young Count de Bellegarde and his father the Marquis of
Antremont. It was here Madam de Warrens introduced me to him,
and this acquaintance, which appeared at that time to end in nothing,
after many years had elapsed, was renewed on an occasion which I

should relate, when it became a real friendship. I apprehend I am
sufficiently authorized in speaking of a man to whom I was so firmly
attached, but I had no personal interest in what concerned him; he
was so truly amiable, and born with so many natural good qualities
that, for the honor of human nature, I should think it necessary to
preserve his memory. This man, estimable as he certainly was, had,
like other mortals, some failings, as will be seen hereafter; perhaps
had it not been so, he would have been less amiable, since, to
render him as interesting as possible, it was necessary he should
sometimes act in such a manner as to require a small portion of
indulgence.
Another connection of the same time, that is not yet extinguished,
and continues to flatter me with the idea of temporal happiness,
which it is so difficult to obliterate from the human heart, is Monsieur
de Conzie, a Savoyard gentleman, then young and amiable, who
had a fancy to learn music, or rather to be acquainted with the
person who taught it. With great understanding and taste for polite
acquirements, M. de Conzie possessed a mildness of disposition
which rendered him extremely attractive, and my temper being
somewhat similar, when it found a counterpart, our friendship was
soon formed. The seeds of literature and philosophy, which began to
ferment in my brain, and only waited for culture and emulation to
spring up, found in him exactly what was wanting to render them
prolific. M. de Conzie had no great inclination to music, and even this
was useful to me, for the hours destined for lessons were passed
anyhow rather than musically; we breakfasted, chatted, and read
new publications, but not a word of music.
The correspondence between Voltaire and the Prince Royal of
Prussia, then made a noise in the world, and these celebrated men
were frequently the subject of our conversation, one of whom
recently seated on a throne, already indicated what he would prove
himself hereafter, while the other, as much disgraced as he is now
admired, made us sincerely lament the misfortunes that seemed to
pursue him, and which are so frequently the appendage of superior
talents. The Prince of Prussia had not been happy in his youth, and it
appeared that Voltaire was formed never to be so. The interest we
took in both parties extended to all that concerned them, and nothing

that Voltaire wrote escaped us. The inclination I felt for these
performances inspired me with a desire to write elegantly, and
caused me to endeavor to imitate the colorings of that author, with
whom I was so much enchanted. Some time after, his philosophical
letters (though certainly not his best work) greatly augmented my
fondness for study; it was a rising inclination, which, from that time,
has never been extinguished.
But the moment was not yet arrived when I should give into it
entirely; my rambling disposition (rather contracted than eradicated)
being kept alive by our manner of living at Madam de Warrens,
which was too unsettled for one of my solitary temper. The crowd of
strangers who daily swarmed about her from all parts, and the
certainty I was in that these people sought only to dupe her, each in
his particular mode, rendered home disagreeable. Since I had
succeeded Anet in the confidence of his mistress, I had strictly
examined her circumstances, and saw their evil tendency with
horror. I had remonstrated a hundred times, prayed, argued,
conjured, but all to no purpose. I had thrown myself at her feet, and
strongly represented the catastrophe that threatened her, had
earnestly entreated that she would reform her expenses, and begin
with myself, representing that it was better to suffer something while
she was yet young, than by multiplying her debts and creditors,
expose her old age to vexation and misery.
Sensible of the sincerity of my zeal, she was frequently affected,
and would then make the finest promises in the world: but only let an
artful schemer arrive, and in an instant all her good resolutions were
forgotten. After a thousand proofs of the inefficacy of my
remonstrances, what remained but to turn away my eyes from the
ruin I could not prevent; and fly myself from the door I could not
guard! I made therefore little journeys to Geneva and Lyons, which
diverted my mind in some measure from this secret uneasiness,
though it increased the cause by these additional expenses. I can
truly aver that I should have acquiesed with pleasure in every
retrenchment, had Madam de Warrens really profited by it, but being
persuaded that what I might refuse myself would be distributed
among a set of interested villains, I took advantage of her easiness

to partake with them, and, like the dog returning from the shambles,
carried off a portion of that morsel which I could not protect.
Pretences were not wanting for all these journeys; even Madam
de Warrens would alone have supplied me with more than were
necessary, having plenty of connections, negotiations, affairs, and
commissions, which she wished to have executed by some trusty
hand. In these cases she usually applied to me; I was always willing
to go, and consequently found occasions enough to furnish out a
rambling kind of life. These excursions procured me some good
connections, which have since been agreeable or useful to me.
Among others, I met at Lyons, with M. Perrichon, whose friendship I
accuse myself with not having sufficiently cultivated, considering the
kindness he had for me; and that of the good Parisot, which I shall
speak of in its place, at Grenoble, that of Madam Deybens and
Madam la Presidente de Bardonanche, a woman of great
understanding, and who would have entertained a friendship for me
had it been in my power to have seen her oftener; at Geneva, that of
M. de Closure, the French Resident, who often spoke to me of my
mother, the remembrance of whom neither death nor time had
erased from his heart; likewise those of the two Barillots, the father,
who was very amiable, a good companion, and one of the most
worthy men I ever met, calling me his grandson. During the troubles
of the republic, these two citizens took contrary sides, the son siding
with the people, the father with the magistrates. When they took up
arms in
, I was at Geneva, and saw the father and son quit the
same house armed, the one going to the townhouse, the other to his
quarters, almost certain to meet face to face in the course of two
hours, and prepared to give or receive death from each other. This
unnatural sight made so lively an impression on me, that I solemnly
vowed never to interfere in any civil war, nor assist in deciding our
internal dispute by arms, either personally or by my influence, should
I ever enter into my rights as a citizen. I can bring proofs of having
kept this oath on a very delicate occasion, and it will be confessed
(at least I should suppose so) that this moderation was of some
worth.
But I had not yet arrived at that fermentation of patriotism which
the first sight of Geneva in arms has since excited in my heart, as

may be conjectured by a very grave fact that will not tell to my
advantage, which I forgot to put in its proper place, but which ought
not to be omitted.
My uncle Bernard died at Carolina, where he had been employed
some years in the building of Charles Town, which he had formed
the plan of. My poor cousin, too, died in the Prussian service; thus
my aunt lost, nearly at the same period, her son and husband. These
losses reanimated in some measure her affection for the nearest
relative she had remaining, which was myself. When I went to
Geneva, I reckoned her house my home, and amused myself with
rummaging and turning over the books and papers my uncle had left.
Among them I found some curious ones, and some letters which
they certainly little thought of. My aunt, who set no store by these
dusty papers, would willingly have given the whole to me, but I
contented myself with two or three books, with notes written by the
Minister Bernard, my grandfather, and among the rest, the
posthumous works of Rohault in quarto, the margins of which were
full of excellent commentaries, which gave me an inclination to the
mathematics. This book remained among those of Madam de
Warrens, and I have since lamented that I did not preserve it. To
these I added five or six memorials in manuscript, and a printed one,
composed by the famous Micheli Ducret, a man of considerable
talents, being both learned and enlightened, but too much, perhaps,
inclined to sedition, for which he was cruelly treated by the
magistrates of Geneva, and lately died in the fortress of Arberg,
where he had been confined many years, for being, as it was said,
concerned in the conspiracy of Berne.
This memorial was a judicious critique on the extensive but
ridiculous plan of fortification, which had been adopted at Geneva,
though censured by every person of judgment in the art, who was
unacquainted with the secret motives of the council, in the execution
of this magnificent enterprise. Monsieur de Micheli, who had been
excluded from the committee of fortification for having condemned
this plan, thought that, as a citizen, and a member of the two
hundred, he might give his advice, at large, and therefore, did so in
this memorial, which he was imprudent enough to have printed,
though he never published it, having only those copies struck off

which were meant for the two hundred, and which were all
intercepted at the post-house by order of the Senate.
[The grand council of Geneva in December,
,
pronounced this paper highly disrespectful to the councils,
and injurious to the committee of fortification.]
I found this memorial among my uncle's papers, with the answer
he had been ordered to make to it, and took both. This was soon
after I had left my place at the survey, and I yet remained on good
terms with the Counsellor de Coccelli, who had the management of
it. Some time after, the director of the custom-house entreated me to
stand godfather to his child, with Madam Coccelli, who was to be
godmother: proud of being placed on such terms of equality with the
counsellor, I wished to assume importance, and show myself worthy
of that honor.
Full of this idea, I thought I could do nothing better than show him
Micheli's memorial, which was really a scarce piece, and would
prove I was connected with people of consequence in Geneva, who
were intrusted with the secrets of the state, yet by a kind of reserve
which I should find it difficult to account for, I did not show him my
uncle's answer, perhaps, because it was manuscript, and nothing
less than print was worthy to approach the counsellor. He
understood, however, so well the importance of this paper, which I
had the folly to put into his hands, that I could never after get it into
my possession, and being convinced that every effort for that
purpose would be ineffectual, I made a merit of my forbearance,
transforming the theft into a present. I made no doubt that this writing
(more curious, however, than useful) answered his purpose at the
court of Turin, where probably he took care to be reimbursed in
some way or other for the expense which the acquisition of it might
be supposed to have cost him. Happily, of all future contingencies,
the least probable, is, that ever the King of Sardina should besiege
Geneva, but as that event is not absolutely impossible, I shall ever
reproach my foolish vanity with having been the means of pointing
out the greatest defects of that city to its most ancient enemy.

I passed three or four years in this manner, between music,
magestry, projects, and journeys, floating incessantly from one
object to another, and wishing to fix though I knew not on what, but
insensibly inclining towards study. I was acquainted with men of
letters, I had heard them speak of literature, and sometimes mingled
in the conversation, yet rather adopted the jargon of books, than the
knowledge they contained. In my excursions to Geneva, I frequently
called on my good old friend Monsieur Simon, who greatly promoted
my rising emulation by fresh news from the republic of letters,
extracted from Baillet on Colomies. I frequently saw too, at
Chambery, a Dominican professor of physic, a good kind of friar,
whose name I have forgotten, who often made little chemical
experiments which greatly amused me. In imitation of him, I
attempted to make some sympathetic ink, and having for that
purpose more than half filled a bottle with quicklime, orpiment, and
water, the effervescence immediately became extremely violent; I
ran to unstop the bottle, but had not time to effect it, for, during the
attempt, it burst in my face like a bomb, and I swallowed so much of
the orpiment and lime, that it nearly cost me my life. I remained blind
for six weeks, and by the event of this experiment learned to meddle
no more with experimental Chemistry while the elements were
unknown to me.
This adventure happened very unluckily for my health, which, for
some time past, had been visibly on the decline. This was rather
extraordinary, as I was guilty of no kind of excess; nor could it have
been expected from my make, for my chest, being well formed and
rather capacious, seemed to give my lungs full liberty to play; yet I
was short breathed, felt a very sensible oppression, sighed
involuntarily, had palpitations of the heart, and spitting of blood,
accompanied with a lingering fever, which I have never since entirely
overcome. How is it possible to fall into such a state in the flower of
one's age, without any inward decay, or without having done
anything to destroy health?
It is sometimes said, "the sword wears the scabbard," this was
truly the case with me: the violence of my passions both kept me
alive and hastened my dissolution. What passions? will be asked:
mere nothings: the most trivial objects in nature, but which affected

me as forcibly as if the acquisition of a Helen, or the throne of the
universe were at stake. My senses, for instance, were at ease with
one woman, but my heart never was, and the necessities of love
consumed me in the very bosom of happiness. I had a tender,
respected and lovely friend, but I sighed for a mistress; my prolific
fancy painted her as such, and gave her a thousand forms, for had I
conceived that my endearments had been lavished on Madam de
Warrens, they would not have been less tender, though infinitely
more tranquil. But is it possible for man to taste, in their utmost
extent, the delights of love? I cannot tell, but I am persuaded my frail
existence would have sunk under the weight of them.
I was, therefore, dying for love without an object, and this state,
perhaps, is, of all others, the most dangerous. I was likewise uneasy,
tormented at the bad state of poor Madam de Warrens'
circumstances, and the imprudence of her conduct, which could not
fail to bring them, in a short time, to total ruin. My tortured
imagination (which ever paints misfortunes in the extremity)
continually beheld this in its utmost excess, and in all the horror of its
consequences. I already saw myself forced by want to quit her—to
whom I had consecrated my future life, and without whom I could not
hope for happiness: thus was my soul continually agitated, and
hopes and fears devoured me alternately.
Music was a passion less turbulent, but not less consuming, from
the ardor with which I attached myself to it, by the obstinate study of
the obscure books of Rameau; by an invincible resolution to charge
my memory with rules it could not contain; by continual application,
and by long and immense compilations which I frequently passed
whole nights in copying: but why dwell on these particularly, while
every folly that took possession of my wandering brain, the most
transient ideas of a single day, a journey, a concert, a supper, a walk,
a novel to read, a play to see, things in the world the least
premeditated in my pleasures or occupation became for me the most
violent passions, which by their ridiculous impetuosity conveyed the
most serious torments; even the imaginary misfortunes of Cleveland,
read with avidity and frequent interruption, have, I am persuaded,
disordered me more than my own.

There was a Genevese, named Bagueret, who had been
employed under Peter the Great, of the court of Russia, one of the
most worthless, senseless fellows I ever met with; full of projects as
foolish as himself, which were to rain down millions on those who
took part in them. This man, having come to Chambery on account
of some suit depending before the senate, immediately got
acquainted with Madam de Warrens, and with great reason on his
side, since for those imaginary treasures that cost him nothing, and
which he bestowed with the utmost prodigality, he gained, in
exchange, the unfortunate crown pieces one by one out of her
pocket. I did not like him, and he plainly perceived this, for with me it
is not a very difficult discovery, nor did he spare any sort of
meanness to gain my good will, and among other things proposed
teaching me to play at chess, which game he understood something
of. I made an attempt, though almost against my inclination, and
after several efforts, having learned the march, my progress was so
rapid, that before the end of the first sitting I gave him the rook,
which in the beginning he had given me. Nothing more was
necessary; behold me fascinated with chess! I buy a board, with the
rest of the apparatus, and shutting myself up in my chamber, pass
whole days and nights in studying all the varieties of the game, being
determined by playing alone, without end or relaxation, to drive them
into my head, right or wrong. After incredible efforts, during two or
three months passed in this curious employment, I go to the coffeehouse, thin, sallow, and almost stupid; I seat myself, and again
attack M. Bagueret: he beats me, once, twice, twenty times; so many
combinations were fermenting in my head, and my imagination was
so stupefied, that all appeared confusion. I tried to exercise myself
with Phitidor's or Stamina's book of instructions, but I was still
equally perplexed, and, after having exhausted myself with fatigue,
was further to seek than ever, and whether I abandoned my chess
for a time, or resolved to surmount every difficulty by unremitted
practice, it was the same thing. I could never advance one step
beyond the improvement of the first sitting, nay, I am convinced that
had I studied it a thousand ages, I should have ended by being able
to give Bagueret the rook and nothing more.

It will be said my time was well employed, and not a little of it
passed in this occupation, nor did I quit my first essay till unable to
persist in it, for on leaving my apartment I had the appearance of a
corpse, and had I continued this course much longer I should
certainly have been one.
Any one will allow that it would have been extraordinary, especially
in the ardor of youth, that such a head should suffer the body to
enjoy continued health; the alteration of mine had an effect on my
temper, moderating the ardor of my chimerical fancies, for as I grew
weaker they became more tranquil, and I even lost, in some
measure, my rage for travelling. I was not seized with heaviness, but
melancholy; vapors succeeded passions, languor became sorrow: I
wept and sighed without cause, and felt my life ebbing away before I
had enjoyed it. I only trembled to think of the situation in which I
should leave my dear Madam de Warrens; and I can truly say, that
quitting her, and leaving her in these melancholy circumstances, was
my only concern. At length I fell quite ill, and was nursed by her as
never mother nursed a child. The care she took of me was of real
utility to her affairs, since it diverted her mind from schemes, and
kept projectors at a distance. How pleasing would death have been
at that time, when, if I had not tasted many of the pleasures of life, I
had felt but few of its misfortunes. My tranquil soul would have taken
her flight, without having experienced those cruel ideas of the
injustice of mankind which embitters both life and death. I should
have enjoyed the sweet consolation that I still survived in the dearer
part of myself: in the situation I then was, it could hardly be called
death; and had I been divested of my uneasiness on her account, it
would have appeared but a gentle sleep; yet even these
disquietudes had such an affectionate and tender turn, that their
bitterness was tempered by a pleasing sensibility. I said to her, "You
are the depository of my whole being, act so that I may be happy."
Two or three times, when my disorder was most violent, I crept to her
apartment to give her my advice respecting her future conduct; and I
dare affirm these admonitions were both wise and equitable, in
which the interest I took in her future concerns was strongly marked.
As if tears had been both nourishment and medicine, I found myself
the better for those I shed with her, while seated on her bed-side,

and holding her hands between mine. The hours crept insensibly
away in these nocturnal discourses; I returned to my chamber better
than I had quitted it, being content and calmed by the promises she
made, and the hopes with which she had inspired me: I slept on
them with my heart at peace, and fully resigned to the dispensations
of Providence. God grant, that after having had so many reasons to
hate life, after being agitated with so many storms, after it has even
become a burden, that death, which must terminate all, may be no
more terrible than it would have been at that moment!
By inconceivable care and vigilance, she saved my life; and I am
convinced she alone could have done this. I have little faith in the
skill of physicians, but depend greatly on the assistance of real
friends, and am persuaded that being easy in those particulars on
which our happiness depends, is more salutary than any other
application. If there is a sensation in life peculiarly delightful, we
experienced it in being restored to each other; our mutual
attachment did not increase, for that was impossible, but it became, I
know not how, more exquisitely tender, fresh softness being added
to its former simplicity. I became in a manner her work; we got into
the habit, though without design, of being continually with each other,
and enjoying, in some measure, our whole existence together,
feeling reciprocally that we were not only necessary, but entirely
sufficient for each other's happiness. Accustomed to think of no
subject foreign to ourselves, our happiness and all our desires were
confined to that pleasing and singular union, which, perhaps, had no
equal, which is not, as I have before observed, love, but a sentiment
inexpressibly more intimate, neither depending on the senses, age,
nor figure, but an assemblage of every endearing sensation that
composes our rational existence and which can cease only with our
being.
How was it that this delightful crisis did not secure our mutual
felicity for the remainder of her life and mine? I have the consoling
conviction that it was not my fault; nay, I am persuaded, she did not
wilfully destroy it; the invincible peculiarity of my disposition was
doomed soon to regain its empire; but this fatal return was not
suddenly accomplished, there was, thank Heaven, a short but

precious interval, that did not conclude by my fault, and which I
cannot reproach myself with having employed amiss.
Though recovered from my dangerous illness, I did not regain my
strength; my stomach was weak, some remains of the fever kept me
in a languishing condition, and the only inclination I was sensible of,
was to end my days near one so truly dear to me; to confirm her in
those good resolutions she had formed; to convince her in what
consisted the real charms of a happy life, and, as far as depended
on me, to render hers so; but I foresaw that in a gloomy, melancholy
house, the continual solitude of our tete-a-tetes would at length
become too dull and monotonous: a remedy presented itself: Madam
de Warrens had prescribed milk for me, and insisted that I should
take it in the country; I consented, provided she would accompany
me; nothing more was necessary to gain her compliance, and
whither we should go was all that remained to be determined on. Our
garden (which I have before mentioned) was not properly in the
country, being surrounded by houses and other gardens, and
possessing none of those attractions so desirable in a rural retreat;
besides, after the death of Anet, we had given up this place from
economical principles, feeling no longer a desire to rear plants, and
other views making us not regret the loss of that little retreat.
Improving the distaste I found she began to imbibe for the town, I
proposed to abandon it entirely, and settle ourselves in an agreeable
solitude, in some small house, distant enough from the city to avoid
the perpetual intrusion of her hangers-on. She followed my advice,
and this plan, which her good angel and mine suggested, might fully
have secured our happiness and tranquility till death had divided us
—but this was not the state we were appointed to; Madam de
Warrens was destined to endure all the sorrows of indigence and
poverty, after having passed the former part of her life in abundance,
that she might learn to quit it with the less regret; and myself, by an
assemblage of misfortunes of all kinds, was to become a striking
example to those who, inspired with a love of justice and the public
good, and trusting too implicitly to their own innocence, shall openly
dare to assert truth to mankind, unsupported by cabals, or without
having previously formed parties to protect them.

An unhappy fear furnished some objections to our plan: she did
not dare to quit her ill-contrived house, for fear of displeasing the
proprietor. "Your proposed retirement is charming," said she, "and
much to my taste, but we are necessitated to remain here, for, on
quitting this dungeon, I hazard losing the very means of life, and
when these fail us in the woods, we must again return to seek them
in the city. That we may have the least possible cause for being
reduced to this necessity, let us not leave this house entirely, but pay
a small pension to the Count of Saint-Laurent, that he may continue
mine. Let us seek some little habitation, far enough from the town to
be at peace, yet near enough to return when it may appear
convenient."
This mode was finally adopted; and after some small search, we
fixed at Charmettes, on an estate belonging to M. de Conzie, at a
very small distance from Chambery; but as retired and solitary as if it
had been a hundred leagues off. The spot we had concluded on was
a valley between two tolerably high hills, which ran north and south;
at the bottom, among the trees and pebbles, ran a rivulet, and above
the declivity, on either side, were scattered a number of houses,
forming altogether a beautiful retreat for those who love a peaceful
romantic asylum. After having examined two or three of these
houses, we chose that which we thought the most pleasing, which
was the property of a gentleman of the army, called M. Noiret. This
house was in good condition, before it a garden, forming a terrace;
below that on the declivity an orchard, and on the ascent, behind the
house, a vineyard: a little wood of chestnut trees opposite; a fountain
just by, and higher up the hill, meadows for the cattle; in short, all
that could be thought necessary for the country retirement we
proposed to establish. To the best of my remembrance, we took
possession of it toward the latter end of the summer Of
. I was
delighted on going to sleep there—"Oh!" said I, to this dear friend,
embracing her with tears of tenderness and delight, "this is the
abode of happiness and innocence; if we do not find them here
together it will be in vain to seek them elsewhere."

Hoc erat in votis: Modus agri non ita magnus,
Hortus ubi, et tecto vicinus aqua fons;
Et paululum sylvae super his foret.
I cannot add, 'auctius atque di melius fecere'; but no matter, the
former is enough for my purpose; I had no occasion to have any
property there, it was sufficient that I enjoyed it; for I have long since
both said and felt, that the proprietor and possessor are two very
different people, even leaving husbands and lovers out of the
question.
At this moment began the short happiness of my life, those
peaceful and rapid moments, which have given me a right to say, I
have lived. Precious and ever--regretted moments! Ah! recommence
your delightful course; pass more slowly through my memory, if
possible, than you actually did in your fugitive succession. How shall
I prolong, according to my inclination, this recital at once so pleasing
and simple? How shall I continue to relate the same occurrences,
without wearying my readers with the repetition, any more than I was
satiated with the enjoyment? Again, if all this consisted of facts,
actions, or words, I could somehow or other convey an idea of it; but
how shall I describe what was neither said nor done, nor even
thought, but enjoyed, felt, without being able to particularize any
other object of my happiness than the bare idea? I rose with the sun,
and was happy; I walked, and was happy; I saw Madam de Warrens,
and was happy; I quitted her, and still was happy!--Whether I
rambled through the woods, over the hills, or strolled along the

valley; read, was idle, worked in the garden, or gathered fruits,
happiness continually accompanied me; it was fixed on no particular
object, it was within me, nor could I depart from it a single moment.
Nothing that passed during that charming epocha, nothing that I
did, said, or thought, has escaped my memory. The time that
preceded or followed it, I only recollect by intervals, unequally and
confused; but here I remember all as distinctly as if it existed at this
moment. Imagination, which in my youth was perpetually anticipating
the future, but now takes a retrograde course, makes some amends
by these charming recollections for the deprivation of hope, which I
have lost forever. I no longer see anything in the future that can
tempt my wishes, it is a recollection of the past alone that can flatter
me, and the remembrance of the period I am now describing is so
true and lively, that it sometimes makes me happy, even in spite of
my misfortunes.
Of these recollections I shall relate one example, which may give
some idea of their force and precision. The first day we went to sleep
at Charmettes, the way being up-hill, and Madam de Warrens rather
heavy, she was carried in a chair, while I followed on foot. Fearing
the chairmen would be fatigued, she got out about half-way,
designing to walk the rest of it. As we passed along, she saw
something blue in the hedge, and said, "There's some periwinkle in
flower yet!" I had never seen any before, nor did I stop to examine
this: my sight is too short to distinguish plants on the ground, and I
only cast a look at this as I passed: an interval of near thirty years
had elapsed before I saw any more periwinkle, at least before I
observed it, when being at Cressier in
, with my friend, M. du
Peyrou, we went up a small mountain, on the summit of which there
is a level spot, called, with reason, 'Belle--vue', I was then beginning
to herbalize;--walking and looking among the bushes, I exclaimed
with rapture, "Ah, there's some periwinkle!" Du Peyrou, who
perceived my transport, was ignorant of the cause, but will some day
be informed: I hope, on reading this. The reader may judge by this
impression, made by so small an incident, what an effect must have
been produced by every occurrence of that time.
Meantime, the air of the country did not restore my health; I was
languishing and became more so; I could not endure milk, and was

obliged to discontinue the use of it. Water was at this time the
fashionable remedy for every complaint; accordingly I entered on a
course of it, and so indiscreetly, that it almost released me, not only
from my illness but also from my life. The water I drank was rather
hard and difficult to pass, as water from mountains generally is; in
short, I managed so well, that in the coarse of two months I totally
ruined my stomach, which until that time had been very good, and no
longer digesting anything properly, had no reason to expect a cure.
At this time an accident happened, as singular in itself as in its
subsequent consequences, which can only terminate with my
existence.
One morning, being no worse than usual, while putting up the leaf
of a small table, I felt a sudden and almost inconceivable revolution
throughout my whole frame. I know not how to describe it better than
as a kind of tempest, which suddenly rose in my blood, and spread
in a moment over every part of my body. My arteries began beating
so violently that I not only felt their motion, but even heard it,
particularly that of the carotids, attended by a loud noise in my ears,
which was of three, or rather four, distinct kinds. For instance, first a
grave hollow buzzing; then a more distinct murmur, like the running
of water; then an extremely sharp hissing, attended by the beating I
before mentioned, and whose throbs I could easily count, without
feeling my pulse, or putting a hand to any part of my body. This
internal tumult was so violent that it has injured my auricular organs,
and rendered me, from that time, not entirely deaf, but hard of
hearing.
My surprise and fear may easily be conceived; imagining it was
the stroke of death, I went to bed, and the physician being sent for,
trembling with apprehension, I related my case; judging it past all
cure. I believe the doctor was of the same opinion; however he
performed his office, running over a long string of causes and effects
beyond my comprehension, after which, in consequence of this
sublime theory, he set about, 'in anima vili', the experimental part of
his art, but the means he was pleased to adopt in order to effect a
cure were so troublesome, disgusting, and followed by so little effect,
that I soon discontinued it, and after some weeks, finding I was
neither better nor worse, left my bed, and returned to my usual

method of living; but the beating of my arteries and the buzzing in my
ears has never quitted me a moment during the thirty years' time
which has elapsed since that time.
Till now, I had been a great sleeper, but a total privation of repose,
with other alarming symptoms which have accompanied it, even to
this time, persuaded me I had but a short time to live. This idea
tranquillized me for a time: I became less anxious about a cure, and
being persuaded I could not prolong life, determined to employ the
remainder of it as usefully as possible. This was practicable by a
particular indulgence of Nature, which, in this melancholy state,
exempted me from sufferings which it might have been supposed I
should have experienced. I was incommoded by the noise, but felt
no pain, nor was it accompanied by any habitual inconvenience,
except nocturnal wakefulness, and at all times a shortness of breath,
which is not violent enough to be called an asthma, but was
troublesome when I attempted to run, or use any degree of exertion.
This accident, which seemed to threaten the dissolution of my
body, only killed my passions, and I have reason to thank Heaven for
the happy effect produced by it on my soul. I can truly say, I only
began to live when I considered myself as entering the grave; for,
estimating at their real value those things I was quitting; I began to
employ myself on nobler objects, namely by anticipating those I
hoped shortly to have the contemplation of, and which I had hitherto
too much neglected. I had often made light of religion, but was never
totally devoid of it; consequently, it cost me less pain to employ my
thoughts on that subject, which is generally thought melancholy,
though highly pleasing to those who make it an object of hope and
consolation; Madam de Warrens, therefore, was more useful to me
on this occasion than all the theologians in the world would have
been.
She, who brought everything into a system, had not failed to do as
much by religion; and this system was composed of ideas that bore
no affinity to each other. Some were extremely good, and others very
ridiculous, being made up of sentiments proceeding from her
disposition, and prejudices derived from education. Men, in general,
make God like themselves; the virtuous make Him good, and the
profligate make Him wicked; ill-tempered and bilious devotees see

nothing but hell, because they would willingly damn all mankind;
while loving and gentle souls disbelieve it altogether; and one of the
astonishments I could never overcome, is to see the good Fenelon
speak of it in his Telemachus as if he really gave credit to it; but I
hope he lied in that particular, for however strict he might be in
regard to truth, a bishop absolutely must lie sometimes. Madam de
Warrens spoke truth with me, and that soul, made up without gall,
who could not imagine a revengeful and ever angry God, saw only
clemency and forgiveness, where devotees bestowed inflexible
justice, and eternal punishment.
She frequently said there would be no justice in the Supreme
Being should He be strictly just to us; because, not having bestowed
what was necessary to render us essentially good, it would be
requiring more than he had given. The most whimsical idea was, that
not believing in hell, she was firmly persuaded of the reality of
purgatory. This arose from her not knowing what to do with the
wicked, being loathed to damn them utterly, nor yet caring to place
them with the good till they had become so; and we must really
allow, that both in this world and the next, the wicked are very
troublesome company.
It is clearly seen that the doctrine of original sin and the
redemption of mankind is destroyed by this system; consequently
that the basis of the Christian dispensation, as generally received, is
shaken, and that the Catholic faith cannot subsist with these
principles; Madam de Warrens, notwithstanding, was a good
Catholic, or at least pretended to be one, and certainly desired to
become such, but it appeared to her that the Scriptures were too
literally and harshly explained, supposing that all we read of
everlasting torments were figurative threatenings, and the death of
Jesus Christ an example of charity, truly divine, which should teach
mankind to love God and each other; in a word, faithful to the religion
she had embraced, she acquiesced in all its professions of faith, but
on a discussion of each particular article, it was plain she thought
diametrically opposite to that church whose doctrines she professed
to believe. In these cases she exhibited simplicity of art, a frankness
more eloquent than sophistry, which frequently embarrassed her
confessor; for she disguised nothing from him. "I am a good

Catholic," she would say, "and will ever remain so; I adopt with all
the powers of my soul the decisions of our holy Mother Church; I am
not mistress of my faith, but I am of my will, which I submit to you
without reserve; I will endeavor to believe all,--what can you require
more?"
Had there been no Christian morality established, I am persuaded
she would have lived as if regulated by its principles, so perfectly did
they seem to accord with her disposition. She did everything that
was required; and she would have done the same had there been no
such requisition: but all this morality was subordinate to the
principles of M. Tavel, or rather she pretended to see nothing in
religion that contradicted them; thus she would have favored twenty
lovers in a day, without any idea of a crime, her conscience being no
more moved in that particular than her passions. I know that a
number of devotees are not more scrupulous, but the difference is,
they are seduced by constitution, she was blinded by her sophisms.
In the midst of conversations the most affecting, I might say the most
edifying, she would touch on this subject, without any change of air
or manner, and without being sensible of any contradiction in her
opinions; so much was she persuaded that our restrictions on that
head are merely political, and that any person of sense might
interpret, apply, or make exceptions to them, without any danger of
offending the Almighty.
Though I was far enough from being of the same opinion in this
particular, I confess I dared not combat hers; indeed, as I was
situated, it would have been putting myself in rather awkward
circumstances, since I could only have sought to establish my
opinion for others, myself being an exception. Besides, I entertained
but little hopes of making her alter hers, which never had any great
influence on her conduct, and at the time I am speaking of none; but
I have promised faithfully to describe her principles, and I will
perform my engagement--I now return to myself.
Finding in her all those ideas I had occasion for to secure me from
the fears of death and its future consequences, I drew confidence
and security from this source; my attachment became warmer than
ever, and I would willingly have transmitted to her my whole
existence, which seemed ready to abandon me. From this redoubled

attachment, a persuasion that I had but a short time to live, and
profound security on my future state, arose an habitual and even
pleasing serenity, which, calming every passion that extends our
hopes and fears, made me enjoy without inquietude or concern the
few days which I imagined remained for me. What contributed to
render them still snore agreeable was an endeavor to encourage her
rising taste for the country, by every amusement I could possibly
devise, wishing to attach her to her garden, poultry, pigeons, and
cows: I amused myself with them and these little occupations, which
employed my time without injuring my tranquillity, were more
serviceable than a milk diet, or all the remedies bestowed on my
poor shattered machine, even to effecting the utmost possible
reestablishment of it.
The vintage and gathering in our fruit employed the remainder of
the year; we became more and more attached to a rustic life, and the
society of our honest neighbors. We saw the approach of winter with
regret, and returned to the city as if going into exile. To me this return
was particularly gloomy, who never expected to see the return of
spring, and thought I took an everlasting leave of Charmettes. I did
not quit it without kissing the very earth and trees, casting back many
a wishful look as I went towards Chambery.
Having left my scholars for so long a time, and lost my relish for
the amusements of the town, I seldom went out, conversing only with
Madam de Warrens and a Monsieur Salomon, who had lately
become our physician. He was an honest man, of good
understanding, a great Cartesian, spoke tolerably well on the system
of the world, and his agreeable and instructive conversations were
more serviceable than his prescriptions. I could never bear that
foolish trivial mode of conversation which is so generally adopted;
but useful instructive discourse has always given me great pleasure,
nor was I ever backward to join in it. I was much pleased with that of
M. Salomon; it appeared to me, that when in his company, I
anticipated the acquisition of that sublime knowledge which my soul
would enjoy when freed from its mortal fetters. The inclination I had
for him extended to the subjects which he treated on, and I began to
look after books which might better enable me to understand his
discourse. Those which mingled devotion with science were most

agreeable to me, particularly Port Royal's Oratory, and I began to
read or rather to devour them. One fell into my hands written by
Father Lami, called 'Entretiens sur les Sciences', which was a kind of
introduction to the knowledge of those books it treated of. I read it
over a hundred times, and resolved to make this my guide; in short, I
found (notwithstanding my ill state of health) that I was irresistibly
drawn towards study, and though looking on each day as the last of
my life, read with as much avidity as if certain I was to live forever.
I was assured that reading would injure me; but on the contrary, I
am rather inclined to think it was serviceable, not only to my soul, but
also to my body; for this application, which soon became delightful,
diverted my thoughts from my disorders, and I soon found myself
much less affected by them. It is certain, however, that nothing gave
me absolute ease, but having no longer any acute pain, I became
accustomed to languishment and wakefulness; to thinking instead of
acting; in short, I looked on the gradual and slow decay of my body
as inevitably progressive and only to be terminated by death.
This opinion not only detached me from all the vain cares of life,
but delivered me from the importunity of medicine, to which hitherto,
I had been forced to submit, though contrary to my inclination.
Salomon, convinced that his drugs were unavailing, spared me the
disagreeable task of taking them, and contented himself with
amusing the grief of my poor Madam de Warrens by some of those
harmless preparations, which serve to flatter the hopes of the patient
and keep up the credit of the doctor. I discontinued the strict regimen
I had latterly observed, resumed the use of wine, and lived in every
respect like a man in perfect health, as far as my strength would
permit, only being careful to run into no excess; I even began to go
out and visit my acquaintance, particularly M. de Conzie, whose
conversation was extremely pleasing to me. Whether it struck me as
heroic to study to my last hour, or that some hopes of life yet lingered
in the bottom of my heart, I cannot tell, but the apparent certainty of
death, far from relaxing my inclination for improvement, seemed to
animate it, and I hastened to acquire knowledge for the other world,
as if convinced I should only possess that portion I could carry with
me. I took a liking to the shop of a bookseller, whose name was
Bouchard, which was frequented by some men of letters, and as the

spring (whose return I had never expected to see again) was
approaching, furnished myself with some books for Charmettes, in
case I should have the happiness to return there.
I had that happiness, and enjoyed it to the utmost extent. The
rapture with which I saw the trees put out their first bud, is
inexpressible! The return of spring seemed to me like rising from the
grave into paradise. The snow was hardly off the ground when we
left our dungeon and returned to Charmettes, to enjoy the first
warblings of the nightingale. I now thought no more of dying, and it is
really singular, that from this time I never experienced any
dangerous illness in the country. I have suffered greatly, but never
kept my bed, and have often said to those about me, on finding
myself worse than ordinary, "Should you see me at the point of
death, carry me under the shade of an oak, and I promise you I shall
recover."
Though weak, I resumed my country occupations, as far as my
strength would permit, and conceived a real grief at not being able to
manage our garden without help; for I could not take five or six
strokes with the spade without being out of breath and overcome
with perspiration; when I stooped the beating redoubled, and the
blood flew with such violence to my head, that I was instantly obliged
to stand upright. Being therefore confined to less fatiguing
employments, I busied myself about the dove --house, and was so
pleased with it that I sometimes passed several hours there without
feeling a moment's weariness. The pigeon is very timid and difficult
to tame, yet I inspired mine with so much confidence that they
followed me everywhere, letting me catch them at pleasure, nor
could I appear in the garden without having two or three on my arms
or head in an instant, and notwithstanding the pleasure I took in
them, their company became so troublesome that I was obliged to
lessen the familiarity. I have ever taken great pleasure in taming
animals, particularly those that are wild and fearful. It appeared
delightful to me, to inspire them with a confidence which I took care
never to abuse, wishing them to love me freely.
I have already mentioned that I purchased some books: I did not
forget to read them, but in a manner more proper to fatigue than
instruct me. I imagined that to read a book profitably, it was

necessary to be acquainted with every branch of knowledge it even
mentioned; far from thinking that the author did not do this himself,
but drew assistance from other books, as he might see occasion.
Full of this silly idea, I was stopped every moment, obliged to run
from one book to another, and sometimes, before I could reach the
tenth page of what I was studying, found it necessary to turn over a
whole library. I was so attached to this ridiculous method, that I lost a
prodigious deal of time and had bewildered my head to such a
degree, that I was hardly capable of doing, seeing or comprehending
anything. I fortunately perceived, at length, that I was in the wrong
road, which would entangle me in an inextricable labyrinth, and
quitted it before I was irrevocably lost.
When a person has any real taste for the sciences, the first thing
he perceives in the pursuit of them is that connection by which they
mutually attract, assist, and enlighten each other, and that it is
impossible to attain one without the assistance of the rest. Though
the human understanding cannot grasp all, and one must ever be
regarded as the principal object, yet if the rest are totally neglected,
the favorite study is generally obscure; I was convinced that my
resolution to improve was good and useful in itself, but that it was
necessary I should change my method; I, therefore, had recourse to
the encyclopaedia. I began by a distribution of the general mass of
human knowledge into its various branches, but soon discovered
that I must pursue a contrary course, that I must take each
separately, and trace it to that point where it united with the rest: thus
I returned to the general synthetical method, but returned thither with
a conviction that I was going right. Meditation supplied the want of
knowledge, and a very natural reflection gave strength to my
resolutions, which was, that whether I lived or died, I had no time to
lose; for having learned but little before the age of five-and-twenty,
and then resolving to learn everything, was engaging to employ the
future time profitably. I was ignorant at what point accident or death
might put a period to my endeavors, and resolved at all events to
acquire with the utmost expedition some idea of every species of
knowledge, as well to try my natural disposition, as to judge for
myself what most deserved cultivation.

In the execution of my plan, I experienced another advantage
which I had never thought of; this was, spending a great deal of time
profitably. Nature certainly never meant me for study, since attentive
application fatigues me so much, that I find it impossible to employ
myself half an hour together intently on any one subject; particularly
while following another person's ideas, for it has frequently
happened that I have pursued my own for a much longer period with
success. After reading a few pages of an author with close
application, my understanding is bewildered, and should I obstinately
continue, I tire myself to no purpose, a stupefaction seizes me, and I
am no longer conscious of what I read; but in a succession of
various subjects, one relieves me from the fatigue of the other, and
without finding respite necessary, I can follow them with pleasure.
I took advantage of this observation in the plan of my studies,
taking care to intermingle them in such a manner that I was never
weary: it is true that domestic and rural concerns furnished many
pleasing relaxations; but as my eagerness for improvement
increased, I contrived to find opportunities for my studies, frequently
employing myself about two things at the same time, without
reflecting that both were consequently neglected.
In relating so many trifling details, which delight me, but frequently
tire my reader, I make use of the caution to suppress a great
number, though, perhaps, he would have no idea of this, if I did not
take care to inform him of it: for example, I recollect with pleasure all
the different methods I adopted for the distribution of my time, in
such a manner as to produce the utmost profit and pleasure. I may
say, that the portion of my life which I passed in this retirement,
though in continual ill-health, was that in which I was least idle and
least wearied. Two or three months were thus employed in
discovering the bent of my genius; meantime, I enjoyed, in the finest
season of the year, and in a spot it rendered delightful, the charms of
a life whose worth I was so highly sensible of, in such a society, as
free as it was charming; if a union so perfect, and the extensive
knowledge I purposed to acquire, can be called society. It seemed to
me as if I already possessed the improvements I was only in pursuit
of: or rather better, since the pleasure of learning constituted a great
part of my happiness.

I must pass over these particulars, which were to me the height of
enjoyment, but are too trivial to bear repeating: indeed, true
happiness is indescribable, it is only to be felt, and this
consciousness of felicity is proportionately more, the less able we
are to describe it; because it does not absolutely result from a
concourse of favorable incidents, but is an affection of the mind
itself. I am frequently guilty of repetitions, but should be infinitely
more so, did I repeat the same thing as often as it recurs with
pleasure to my mind. When at length my variable mode of life was
reduced to a more uniform course, the following was nearly the
distribution of time which I adopted: I rose every morning before the
sun, and passed through a neighboring orchard into a pleasant path,
which, running by a vineyard, led towards Chambery. While walking,
I offered up my prayers, not by a vain motion of the lips, but a
sincere elevation of my heart, to the Great Author of delightful
nature, whose beauties were so charmingly spread out before me! I
never love to pray in a chamber; it seems to me that the walls and all
the little workmanship of man interposed between God and myself: I
love to contemplate Him in his works, which elevate my soul, and
raise my thoughts to Him. My prayers were pure, I can affirm it, and
therefore worthy to be heard:--I asked for myself and her from whom
my thoughts were never divided, only an innocent and quiet life,
exempt from vice, sorrow and want; I prayed that we might die the
death of the just, and partake of their lot hereafter: for the rest, it was
rather admiration and contemplation than request, being satisfied
that the best means to obtain what is necessary from the Giver of
every perfect good, is rather to deserve than to solicit. Returning
from my walk, I lengthened the way by taking a roundabout path, still
contemplating with earnestness and delight the beautiful scenes with
which I was surrounded, those only objects that never fatigue either
the eye or the heart. As I approached our habitation, I looked forward
to see if Madam de Warrens was stirring, and when I perceived her
shutters open, I even ran with joy towards the house: if they were yet
shut I went into the garden to wait their opening, amusing myself,
meantime, by a retrospection of what I had read the preceding
evening, or in gardening. The moment the shutter drew back I
hastened to embrace her, frequently half asleep; and this salute,

pure as it was affectionate, even from its innocence, possessed a
charm which the senses can never bestow. We usually breakfasted
on milk-coffee; this was the time of day when we had most leisure,
and when we chatted with the greatest freedom. These sittings,
which were usually pretty long, have given me a fondness for
breakfasts, and I infinitely prefer those of England, or Switzerland,
which are considered as a meal, at which all the family assemble,
than those of France, where they breakfast alone in their several
apartments, or more frequently have none at all. After an hour or two
passed in discourse, I went to my study till dinner; beginning with
some philosophical work, such as the logic of Port-Royal, Locke's
Essays, Mallebranche, Leibtnitz, Descartes, etc. I soon found that
these authors perpetually contradict each other, and formed the
chimerical project of reconciling them, which cost me much labor and
loss of time, bewildering my head without any profit. At length
(renouncing this idea) I adopted one infinitely more profitable, to
which I attribute all the progress I have since made, notwithstanding
the defects of my capacity; for 'tis certain I had very little for study.
On reading each author, I acquired a habit of following all his ideas,
without suffering my own or those of any other writer to interfere with
them, or entering into any dispute on their utility. I said to myself, "I
will begin by laying up a stock of ideas, true or false, but clearly
conceived, till my understanding shall be sufficiently furnished to
enable me to compare and make choice of those that are most
estimable." I am sensible this method is not without its
inconveniences, but it succeeded in furnishing me with a fund of
instruction. Having passed some years in thinking after others,
without reflection, and almost without reasoning, I found myself
possessed of sufficient materials to set about thinking on my own
account, and when journeys of business deprived me of the
opportunities of consulting books, I amused myself with recollecting
and comparing what I had read, weighing every opinion on the
balance of reason, and frequently judging my masters. Though it
was late before I began to exercise my judicial faculties, I have not
discovered that they had lost their vigor, and on publishing my own
ideas, have never been accused of being a servile disciple or of
swearing 'in verba magistri'.

From these studies I passed to the elements of geometry, for I
never went further, forcing my weak memory to retain them by going
the same ground a hundred and a hundred times over. I did not
admire Euclid, who rather seeks a chain of demonstration than a
connection of ideas: I preferred the geometry of Father Lama, who
from that time became one of my favorite authors, and whose works
I yet read with pleasure. Algebra followed, and Father Lama was still
my guide: when I made some progress, I perused Father Reynaud's
Science of Calculation, and then his Analysis Demonstrated; but I
never went far enough thoroughly to understand the application of
algebra to geometry. I was not pleased with this method of
performing operations by rule without knowing what I was about:
resolving geometrical problems by the help of equations seemed like
playing a tune by turning round a handle. The first time I found by
calculation that the square of a binocular figure was composed of the
square of each of its parts, and double the product of one by the
other; though convinced that my multiplication was right, I could not
be satisfied till I had made and examined the figure: not but I admire
algebra when applied to abstract quantities, but when used to
demonstrate dimensions, I wished to see the operation, and unless
explained by lines, could not rightly comprehend it.
After this came Latin: it was my most painful study, and in which I
never made great progress. I began by Port-Royal's Rudiments, but
without success; I lost myself in a crowd of rules; and in studying the
last forgot all that preceded it. A study of words is not calculated for a
man without memory, and it was principally an endeavor to make my
memory more retentive, that urged me obstinately to persist in this
study, which at length I was obliged to relinquish. As I understood
enough to read an easy author by the aid of a dictionary, I followed
that method, and found it succeed tolerably well. I likewise applied
myself to translation, not by writing, but mentally, and by exercise
and perseverance attained to read Latin authors easily, but have
never been able to speak or write that language, which has
frequently embarrassed me when I have found myself (I know not by
what means) enrolled among men of letters.
Another inconvenience that arose from this manner of learning is,
that I never understood prosody, much less the rules of versification;

yet, anxious to understand the harmony of the language, both in
prose and verse, I have made many efforts to obtain it, but am
convinced, that without a master it is almost impossible. Having
learned the composition of the hexameter, which is the easiest of all
verses, I had the patience to measure out the greater part of Virgil
into feet and quantity, and whenever I was dubious whether a
syllable was long or short, immediately consulted my Virgil. It may
easily be conceived that I ran into many errors in consequence of
those licenses permitted by the rules of versification; and it is certain,
that if there is an advantage in studying alone, there are also great
inconveniences and inconceivable labor, as I have experienced more
than any one.
At twelve I quitted my books, and if dinner was not ready, paid my
friends, the pigeons, a visit, or worked in the garden till it was, and
when I heard myself called, ran very willingly, and with a good
appetite to partake of it, for it is very remarkable, that let me be ever
so indisposed my appetite never fails. We dined very agreeably,
chatting till Madam de Warrens could eat. Two or three times a
week, when it was fine, we drank our coffee in a cool shady arbor
behind the house, that I had decorated with hops, and which was
very refreshing during the heat; we usually passed an hour in
viewing our flowers and vegetables, or in conversation relative to our
manner of life, which greatly increased the pleasure of it. I had
another little family at the end of the garden; these were several
hives of bees, which I never failed to visit once a day, and was
frequently accompanied by Madam de Warrens. I was greatly
interested in their labor, and amused myself seeing them return to
the hives, their little thighs so loaded with the precious store that they
could hardly walk. At first, curiosity made me indiscreet, and they
stung me several times, but afterwards, we were so well acquainted,
that let me approach as near as I would, they never molested me,
though the hives were full and the bees ready to swarm. At these
times I have been surrounded, having them on my hands and face
without apprehending any danger. All animals are distrustful of man,
and with reason, but when once assured he does not mean to injure
them, their confidence becomes so great that he must be worse than
a barbarian who abuses it.

After this I returned to my books; but my afternoon employment
ought rather to bear the name of recreation and amusement, than
labor or study. I have never been able to bear application after
dinner, and in general any kind of attention is painful to me during
the heat of the day. I employed myself, 'tis true, but without restraint
or rule, and read without studying. What I most attended to at these
times, was history and geography, and as these did not require
intense application, made as much progress in them as my weak
memory would permit. I had an inclination to study Father Petau, and
launched into the gloom of chronology, but was disgusted at the
critical part, which I found had neither bottom nor banks; this made
me prefer the more exact measurement of time by the course of the
celestial bodies. I should even have contracted a fondness for
astronomy, had I been in possession of instruments, but was obliged
to content myself with some of the elements of that art, learned from
books, and a few rude observations made with a telescope, sufficient
only to give me a general idea of the situation of the heavenly
bodies; for my short sight is insufficient to distinguish the stars
without the help of a glass.
I recollect an adventure on this subject, the remembrance of which
has often diverted me. I had bought a celestial planisphere to study
the constellations by, and, having fixed it on a frame, when the nights
were fine and the sky clear, I went into the garden; and fixing the
frame on four sticks, something higher than myself, which I drove
into the ground, turned the planisphere downwards, and contrived to
light it by means of a candle (which I put in a pail to prevent the wind
from blowing it out) and then placed in the centre of the above-mentioned four supporters; this done, I examined the stars with my
glass, and from time to time referring to my planisphere, endeavored
to distinguish the various constellations. I think I have before
observed that our garden was on a terrace, and lay open to the road.
One night, some country people passing very late, saw me in a most
grotesque habit, busily employed in these observations: the light,
which struck directly on the planisphere, proceeding from a cause
they could not divine (the candle being concealed by the sides of the
pail), the four stakes supporting a large paper, marked over with
various uncouth figures, with the motion of the telescope, which they

saw turning backwards and forwards, gave the whole an air of
conjuration that struck them with horror and amazement. My figure
was by no means calculated to dispel their fears; a flapped hat put
on over my nightcap, and a short cloak about my shoulder (which
Madam de Warrens had obliged me to put on) presented in their
idea the image of a real sorcerer. Being near midnight, they made no
doubt but this was the beginning of some diabolical assembly, and
having no curiosity to pry further into these mysteries, they fled with
all possible speed, awakened their neighbors, and described this
most dreadful vision. The story spread so fast that the next day the
whole neighborhood was informed that a nocturnal assembly of
witches was held in the garden that belonged to Monsieur Noiret,
and I am ignorant what might have been the consequence of this
rumor if one of the countrymen who had been witness to my
conjurations had not the same day carried his complaint to two
Jesuits, who frequently came to visit us, and who, without knowing
the foundation of the story, undeceived and satisfied them. These
Jesuits told us the whole affair, and I acquainted them with the cause
of it, which altogether furnished us with a hearty laugh. However, I
resolved for the future to make my observations without light, and
consult my planisphere in the house. Those who have read Venetian
magic, in the 'Letters from the Mountain', may find that I long since
had the reputation of being a conjurer.
Such was the life I led at Charmettes when I had no rural
employments, for they ever had the preference, and in those that did
not exceed my strength, I worked like a peasant; but my extreme
weakness left me little except the will; besides, as I have before
observed, I wished to do two things at once, and therefore did
neither well. I obstinately persisted in forcing my memory to retain a
great deal by heart, and for that purpose, I always carried some book
with me, which, while at work, I studied with inconceivable labor. I
was continually repeating something, and am really amazed that the
fatigue of these vain and continual efforts did not render me entirely
stupid. I must have learned and relearned the Eclogues of Virgil
twenty times over, though at this time I cannot recollect a single line
of them. I have lost or spoiled a great number of books by a custom I
had of carrying them with me into the dove-house, the garden,

orchard or vineyard, when, being busy about something else, I laid
my book at the foot of a tree, on the hedge, or the first place that
came to hand, and frequently left them there, finding them a fortnight
after, perhaps, rotted to pieces, or eaten by the ants or snails; and
this ardor for learning became so far a madness that it rendered me
almost stupid, and I was perpetually muttering some passage or
other to myself.
The writings of Port-Royal, and those of the Oratory, being what I
most read, had made me half a Jansenist, and, notwithstanding all
my confidence, their harsh theology sometimes alarmed me. A dread
of hell, which till then I had never much apprehended, by little and
little disturbed my security, and had not Madam de Warrens
tranquillized my soul, would at length have been too much for me.
My confessor, who was hers likewise, contributed all in his power to
keep up my hopes. This was a Jesuit, named Father Hemet; a good
and wise old man, whose memory I shall ever hold in veneration.
Though a Jesuit, he had the simplicity of a child, and his manners,
less relaxed than gentle, were precisely what was necessary to
balance the melancholy impressions made on me by Jansenism.
This good man and his companion, Father Coppier, came frequently
to visit us at Charmette, though the road was very rough and tedious
for men of their age. These visits were very comfortable to me, which
may the Almighty return to their souls, for they were so old that I
cannot suppose them yet living. I sometimes went to see them at
Chambery, became acquainted at their convent, and had free access
to the library. The remembrance of that happy time is so connected
with the idea of those Jesuits, that I love one on account of the other,
and though I have ever thought their doctrines dangerous, could
never find myself in a disposition to hate them cordially.
I should like to know whether there ever passed such childish
notions in the hearts of other men as sometimes do in mine. In the
midst of my studies, and of a life as innocent as man could lead,
notwithstanding every persuasion to the contrary, the dread of hell
frequently tormented me. I asked myself, "What state am I in?
Should I die at this instant, must I be damned?" According to my
Jansenists the matter was indubitable, but according to my
conscience it appeared quite the contrary: terrified and floating in this

cruel uncertainty, I had recourse to the most laughable expedient to
resolve my doubts, for which I would willingly shut up any man as a
lunatic should I see him practise the same folly. One day, meditating
on this melancholy subject, I exercised myself in throwing stones at
the trunks of trees, with my usual dexterity, that is to say, without
hitting any of them. In the height of this charming exercise, it entered
my mind to make a kind of prognostic, that might calm my
inquietude; I said, "I will throw this stone at the tree facing me; if I hit
my mark, I will consider it as a sign of salvation; if I miss, as a token
of damnation." While I said this, I threw the stone with a trembling
hand and beating breast but so happily that it struck the body of the
tree, which truly was not a difficult matter, for I had taken care to
choose one that was very large and very near me. From that
moment I never doubted my salvation: I know not on recollecting this
trait, whether I ought to laugh or shudder at myself. Ye great
geniuses, who surely laugh at my folly, congratulate yourselves on
your superior wisdom, but insult not my unhappiness, for I swear to
you that I feel it most sensibly.
These troubles, these alarms, inseparable, perhaps, from
devotion, were only at intervals; in general, I was tranquil, and the
impression made on my soul by the idea of approaching death, was
less that of melancholy than a peaceful languor, which even had its
pleasures. I have found among my old papers a kind of
congratulation and exhortation which I made to myself on dying at an
age when I had the courage to meet death with serenity, without
having experienced any great evils, either of body or mind. How
much justice was there in the thought! A preconception of what I had
to suffer made me fear to live, and it seemed that I dreaded the fate
which must attend my future days. I have never been so near
wisdom as during this period, when I felt no great remorse for the
past, nor tormenting fear for the future; the reigning sentiment of my
soul being the enjoyment of the present. Serious people usually
possess a lively sensuality, which makes them highly enjoy those
innocent pleasures that are allowed them. Worldlings (I know not
why) impute this to them as a crime: or rather, I well know the cause
of this imputation, it is because they envy others the enjoyment of
those simple and pure delights which they have lost the relish of. I

had these inclinations, and found it charming to gratify them in
security of conscience. My yet inexperienced heart gave in to all with
the calm happiness of a child, or rather (if I dare use the expression)
with the raptures of an angel; for in reality these pure delights are as
serene as those of paradise. Dinners on the grass at Montagnole,
suppers in our arbor, gathering in the fruits, the vintage, a social
meeting with our neighbors; all these were so many holidays, in
which Madam de Warrens took as much pleasure as myself. Solitary
walks afforded yet purer pleasure, because in them our hearts
expanded with greater freedom: one particularly remains in my
memory; it was on a St. Louis' day, whose name Madam de Warrens
bore: we set out together early and unattended, after having heard a
mass at break of day in a chapel adjoining our house, from a
Carmelite, who attended for that purpose. As I proposed walking
over the hills opposite our dwelling, which we had not yet visited, we
sent our provisions on before; the excursion being to last the whole
day. Madam de Warrens, though rather corpulent, did not walk ill,
and we rambled from hill to hill and wood to wood, sometimes in the
sun, but oftener in the shade, resting from time to time, and
regardless how the hours stole away; speaking of ourselves, of our
union, of the gentleness of our fate, and offering up prayers for its
duration, which were never heard. Everything conspired to augment
our happiness: it had rained for several days previous to this, there
was no dust, the brooks were full and rapid, a gentle breeze agitated
the leaves, the air was pure, the horizon free from clouds, serenity
reigned in the sky as in our hearts. Our dinner was prepared at a
peasant's house, and shared with him and his family, whose
benedictions we received. These poor Savoyards are the worthiest
of people! After dinner we regained the shade, and while I was
picking up bits of dried sticks, to boil our coffee, Madam de Warrens
amused herself with herbalizing among the bushes, and with the
flowers I had gathered for her in my way. She made me remark in
their construction a thousand natural beauties, which greatly amused
me, and which ought to have given me a taste for botany; but the
time was not yet come, and my attention was arrested by too many
other studies. Besides this, an idea struck me, which diverted my
thoughts from flowers and plants: the situation of my mind at that

moment, all that we had said or done that day, every object that had
struck me, brought to my remembrance the kind of waking dream I
had at Annecy seven or eight years before, and which I have given
an account of in its place. The similarity was so striking that it
affected me even to tears: in a transport of tenderness I embraced
Madam de Warrens. "My dearest friend," said I, "this day has long
since been promised me: I can see nothing beyond it: my happiness,
by your means, is at its height; may it never decrease; may it
continue as long as I am sensible of its value-then it can only finish
with my life."
Thus happily passed my days, and the more happily as I
perceived nothing that could disturb or bring them to a conclusion;
not that the cause of my former uneasiness had absolutely ceased,
but I saw it take another course, which I directed with my utmost
care to useful objects, that the remedy might accompany the evil.
Madam de Warrens naturally loved the country, and this taste did not
cool while with me. By little and little she contracted a fondness for
rustic employments, wished to make the most of her land, and had in
that particular a knowledge which she practised with pleasure.
Not satisfied with what belonged to the house, she hired first a
field, then a meadow, transferring her enterprising humor to the
objects of agriculture, and instead of remaining unemployed in the
house, was in the way of becoming a complete farmer. I was not
greatly pleased to see this passion increase, and endeavored all I
could to oppose it; for I was certain she would be deceived, and that
her liberal extravagant disposition would infallibly carry her expenses
beyond her profits; however, I consoled myself by thinking the
produce could not be useless, and would at least help her to live. Of
all the projects she could form, this appeared the least ruinous:
without regarding it, therefore, in the light she did, as a profitable
scheme, I considered it as a perpetual employment, which would
keep her from more ruinous enterprises, and out of the reach of
impostors. With this idea, I ardently wished to recover my health and
strength, that I might superintend her affairs, overlook her laborers,
or, rather, be the principal one myself. The exercise this naturally
obliged me to take, with the relaxation it procured me from books
and study, was serviceable to my health.

The winter following, Barillot returning from Italy, brought me some
books; and among others, the 'Bontempi' and 'la Cartella per
Musica', of Father Banchieri; these gave me a taste for the history of
music and for the theoretical researches of that pleasing art. Barillot
remained some time with us, and as I had been of age some
months, I determined to go to Geneva the following spring, and
demand my mother's inheritance, or at least that part which
belonged to me, till it could be ascertained what had become of my
brother. This plan was executed as it had been resolved: I went to
Geneva; my father met me there, for he had occasionally visited
Geneva a long time since, without its being particularly noticed,
though the decree that had been pronounced against him had never
been reversed; but being esteemed for his courage, and respected
for his probity, the situation of his affairs was pretended to be
forgotten; or perhaps, the magistrates, employed with the great
project that broke out some little time after, were not willing to alarm
the citizens by recalling to their memory, at an improper time, this
instance of their former partiality.
I apprehended that I should meet with difficulties, on account of
having changed my religion, but none occurred; the laws of Geneva
being less harsh in that particular than those of Berne, where,
whoever changes his religion, not only loses his freedom, but his
property. My rights, however, were not disputed: but I found my
patrimony, I know not how, reduced to very little, and though it was
known almost to a certainty that my brother was dead, yet, as there
was no legal proof, I could not lay claim to his share, which I left
without regret to my father, who enjoyed it as long as he lived. No
sooner were the necessary formalities adjusted, and I had received
my money, some of which I expended in books, than I flew with the
remainder to Madam de Warrens; my heart beat with joy during the
journey, and the moment in which I gave the money into her hands,
was to me a thousand times more delightful than that which gave it
into mine. She received this with a simplicity common to great souls,
who, doing similar actions without effort, see them without
admiration; indeed it was almost all expended for my use, for it
would have been employed in the same manner had it come from
any other quarter.

My health was not yet re-established; I decayed visibly, was pale
as death, and reduced to an absolute skeleton; the beating of my
arteries was extreme, my palpitations were frequent: I was sensible
of a continual oppression, and my weakness became at length so
great, that I could scarcely move or step without danger of
suffocation, stoop without vertigoes, or lift even the smallest weight,
which reduced me to the most tormenting inaction for a man so
naturally stirring as myself. It is certain my disorder was in a great
measure hypochondriacal. The vapors is a malady common to
people in fortunate situations: the tears I frequently shed, without
reason; the lively alarms I felt on the falling of a leaf, or the fluttering
of a bird; inequality of humor in the calm of a most pleasing life;
lassitude which made me weary even of happiness, and carried
sensibility to extravagance, were an instance of this. We are so little
formed for felicity, that when the soul and body do not suffer
together, they must necessarily endure separate inconveniences, the
good state of the one being almost always injurious to the happiness
of the other. Had all the pleasure of life courted me, my weakened
frame would not have permitted the enjoyment of them, without my
being able to particularize the real seat of my complaint; yet in the
decline of life; after having encountered very serious and real evils,
my body seemed to regain its strength, as if on purpose to encounter
additional misfortunes; and, at the moment I write this, though infirm,
near sixty, and overwhelmed with every kind of sorrow, I feel more
ability to suffer than I ever possessed for enjoyment when in the very
flower of my age, and in the bosom of real happiness.
To complete me, I had mingled a little physiology among my other
readings: I set about studying anatomy, and considering the
multitude, movement, and wonderful construction of the various
parts that composed the human machine; my apprehensions were
instantly increased, I expected to feel mine deranged twenty times a
day, and far from being surprised to find myself dying, was
astonished that I yet existed! I could not read the description of any
malady without thinking it mine, and, had I not been already
indisposed, I am certain I should have become so from this study.
Finding in every disease symptoms similar to mine, I fancied I had
them all, and, at length, gained one more troublesome than any I yet

suffered, which I had thought myself delivered from; this was, a
violent inclination to seek a cure; which it is very difficult to suppress,
when once a person begins reading physical books. By searching,
reflecting, and comparing, I became persuaded that the foundation
of my complaint was a polypus at the heart, and Doctor Salomon
appeared to coincide with the idea. Reasonably this opinion should
have confirmed my former resolution of considering myself past
cure; this, however, was not the case; on the contrary; I exerted
every power of my understanding in search of a remedy for a
polypus, resolving to undertake this marvellous cure.
In a journey which Anet had made to Montpelier, to see the
physical garden there, and visit Monsieur Sauvages, the
demonstrator, he had been informed that Monsieur Fizes had cured
a polypus similar to that I fancied myself afflicted with: Madam de
Warrens, recollecting this circumstance, mentioned it to me, and
nothing more was necessary to inspire me with a desire to consult
Monsieur Fizes. The hope of recovery gave me courage and
strength to undertake the journey; the money from Geneva furnished
the means; Madam de Warrens, far from dissuading, entreated me
to go: behold me, therefore, without further ceremony, set out for
Montpelier!--but it was not necessary to go so far to find the cure I
was in search of.
Finding the motion of the horse too fatiguing, I had hired a chaise
at Grenoble, and on entering Moirans, five or six other chaises
arrived in a rank after mine. The greater part of these were in the
train of a new married lady called Madam du Colombier; with her
was a Madam de Larnage, not so young or handsome as the former,
yet not less amiable. The bride was to stop at Romans, but the other
lady was to pursue her route as far as Saint-Andiol, near the bridge
du St. Esprit. With my natural timidity it will not be conjectured that I
was very ready at forming an acquaintance with these fine ladies,
and the company that attended them; but travelling the same road,
lodging at the same inns, and being obliged to eat at the same table,
the acquaintance seemed unavoidable, as any backwardness on my
part would have got me the character of a very unsociable being: it
was formed then, and even sooner than I desired, for all this bustle
was by no means convenient to a person in ill health, particularly to

one of my humor. Curiosity renders these vixens extremely
insinuating; they accomplish their design of becoming acquainted
with a man by endeavoring to turn his brain, and this was precisely
what happened to me. Madam du Colombier was too much
surrounded by her young gallants to have any opportunity of paying
much attention to me; besides, it was not worthwhile, as we were to
separate in so short a time; but Madam de Larnage (less attended to
than her young friend) had to provide herself for the remainder of the
journey; behold me, then, attacked by Madam de Larnage, and
adieu to poor Jean Jacques, or rather farewell to fever, vapors, and
polypus; all completely vanished when in her presence. The ill state
of my health was the first subject of our conversation; they saw I was
indisposed, knew I was going to Montpelier, but my air and manner
certainly did not exhibit the appearance of a libertine, since it was
clear by what followed they did not suspect I was going there for a
reason that carries many that road.
In the morning they sent to inquire after my health and invite me to
take chocolate with them, and when I made my appearance asked
how I had passed the night. Once, according to my praiseworthy
custom of speaking without thought, I replied, "I did not know," which
answer naturally made them conclude I was a fool: but, on
questioning me further; the examination turned out so far to my
advantage, that I rather rose in their opinion, and I once heard
Madam du Colombier say to her friend, "He is amiable, but not
sufficiently acquainted with the world." These words were a great
encouragement, and assisted me in rendering myself agreeable.
As we became more familiar, it was natural to give each other
some little account of whence we came and who we were: this
embarrassed me greatly, for I was sensible that in good company
and among women of spirit, the very name of a new convert would
utterly undo me. I know not by what whimsicallity I resolved to pass
for an Englishman; however, in consequence of that determination I
gave myself out for a Jacobite, and was readily believed. They called
me Monsieur Dudding, which was the name I assumed with my new
character, and a cursed Marquis Torignan, who was one of the
company, an invalid like myself, and both old and ill --tempered, took
it in his head to begin a long conversation with me. He spoke of King

James, of the Pretender, and the old court of St. Germain's; I sat on
thorns the whole time, for I was totally unacquainted with all these
except what little I had picked up in the account of Earl Hamilton,
and from the gazettes; however, I made such fortunate use of the
little I did know as to extricate myself from this dilemma, happy in not
being questioned on the English language, which I did not know a
single word of.
The company were all very agreeable; we looked forward to the
moment of separation with regret, and therefore made snails'
journeys. We arrived one Sunday at St. Marcelein's; Madam de
Larnage would go to mass; I accompanied her, and had nearly
ruined all my affairs, for by my modest reserved countenance during
the service, she concluded me a bigot, and conceived a very
indifferent opinion of me, as I learned from her own account two
days after. It required a great deal of gallantry on my part to efface
this ill impression, or rather Madam de Larnage (who was not easily
disheartened) determined to risk the first advances, and see how I
should behave. She made several, but far from being presuming on
my figure, I thought she was making sport of me: full of this
ridiculous idea there was no folly I was not guilty of.
Madam de Larnage persisted in such caressing behavior, that a
much wiser man than myself could hardly have taken it seriously.
The more obvious her advances were, the more I was confirmed in
my mistake, and what increased my torment, I found I was really in
love with her. I frequently said to myself, and sometimes to her,
sighing, "Ah! why is not all this real? then should I be the most
fortunate of men." I am inclined to think my stupidity did but increase
her resolution, and make her determined to get the better of it.
We left Madam du Colombier at Romans; after which Madam de
Larnage, the Marquis de Torignan, and myself continued our route
slowly, and in the most agreeable manner. The marquis, though
indisposed, and rather ill-humored, was an agreeable companion,
but was not best pleased at seeing the lady bestow all her attentions
on me, while he passed unregarded; for Madam de Larnage took so
little care to conceal her inclination, that he perceived it sooner than I
did, and his sarcasms must have given me that confidence I could
not presume to take from the kindness of the lady, if by a surmise,

which no one but myself could have blundered on, I had not
imagined they perfectly understood each other, and were agreed to
turn my passion into ridicule. This foolish idea completed my
stupidity, making me act the most ridiculous part, while, had I
listened to the feelings of my heart, I might have been performing
one far more brilliant. I am astonished that Madam de Larnage was
not disgusted at my folly, and did not discard me with disdain; but
she plainly perceived there was more bashfulness than indifference
in my composition.
We arrived at Valence to dinner, and according to our usual
custom passed the remainder of the day there. We lodged out of the
city, at the St. James, an inn I shall never forget. After dinner,
Madam de Larnage proposed a walk; she knew the marquis was no
walker, consequently, this was an excellent plan for a tete-a-tete,
which she was predetermined to make the most of. While we were
walking round the city by the side of the moats, I entered on a long
history of my complaint, to which she answered in so tender an
accent, frequently pressing my arm, which she held to her heart, that
it required all my stupidity not to be convinced of the sincerity of her
attachment. I have already observed that she was amiable; love
rendered her charming, adding all the loveliness of youth: and she
managed her advances with so much art, that they were sufficient to
have seduced the most insensible: I was, therefore, in very uneasy
circumstances, and frequently on the point of making a declaration;
but the dread of offending her, and the still greater of being laughed
at, ridiculed, made table-talk, and complimented on my enterprise by
the satirical marquis, had such unconquerable power over me, that,
though ashamed of my ridiculous bashfulness, I could not take
courage to surmount it. I had ended the history of my complaints,
which I felt the ridiculousness of at this time; and not knowing how to
look, or what to say, continued silent, giving the finest opportunity in
the world for that ridicule I so much dreaded. Happily, Madam de
Larnage took a more favorable resolution, and suddenly interrupted
this silence by throwing her arms round my neck, while, at the same
instant, her lips spoke too plainly on mine to be any longer
misunderstood. This was reposing that confidence in me the want of
which has almost always prevented me from appearing myself: for

once I was at ease, my heart, eyes and tongue, spoke freely what I
felt; never did I make better reparation for my mistakes, and if this
little conquest had cost Madam de Larnage some difficulties, I have
reason to believe she did not regret them.
Was I to live a hundred years, I should never forget this charming
woman. I say charming, for though neither young nor beautiful, she
was neither old nor ugly, having nothing in her appearance that could
prevent her wit and accomplishments from producing all their effects.
It was possible to see her without falling in love, but those she
favored could not fail to adore her; which proves, in my opinion, that
she was not generally so prodigal of her favors. It is true, her
inclination for me was so sudden and lively, that it scarce appears
excusable; though from the short, but charming interval I passed with
her, I have reason to think her heart was more influenced than her
passions.
Our good intelligence did not escape the penetration of the
marquis; not that he discontinued his usual raillery; on the contrary,
he treated me as a sighing, hopeless swain, languishing under the
rigors of his mistress; not a word, smile, or look escaped him by
which I could imagine he suspected my happiness; and I should
have thought him completely deceived, had not Madam de Larnage,
who was more clear-sighted than myself, assured me of the
contrary; but he was a well-bred man, and it was impossible to
behave with more attention or greater civility, than he constantly paid
me (notwithstanding his satirical sallies), especially after my
success, which, as he was unacquainted with my stupidity, he
perhaps gave me the honor of achieving. It has already been seen
that he was mistaken in this particular; but no matter, I profited by his
error, for being conscious that the laugh was on my side, I took all
his sallies in good part, and sometimes parried them with tolerable
success; for, proud of the reputation of wit which Madam de Larnage
had thought fit to discover in me, I no longer appeared the same
man.
We were both in a country and season of plenty, and had
everywhere excellent cheer, thanks to the good cares of the marquis;
though I would willingly have relinquished this advantage to have
been more satisfied with the situation of our chambers; but he

always sent his footman on to provide them; and whether of his own
accord, or by the order of his master, the rogue always took care that
the marquis' chamber should be close by Madam de Larnage's,
while mine was at the further end of the house: but that made no
great difference, or perhaps it rendered our rendezvous the more
charming; this happiness lasted four or five days, during which time I
was intoxicated with delight, which I tasted pure and serene without
any alloy; an advantage I could never boast before; and, I may add,
it is owing to Madam de Larnage that I did not go out of the world
without having tasted real pleasure.
If the sentiment I felt for her was not precisely love, it was at least
a very tender return of what she testified for me; our meetings were
so delightful, that they possessed all the sweets of love; without that
kind of delirium which affects the brain, and even tends to diminish
our happiness. I never experienced true love but once in my life, and
that was not with Madam de Larnage, neither did I feel that affection
for her which I had been sensible of, and yet continued to possess,
for Madam de Warrens; but for this very reason, our tete-a-tetes
were a hundred times more delightful. When with Madam de
Warrens, my felicity was always disturbed by a secret sadness, a
compunction of heart, which I found it impossible to surmount.
Instead of being delighted at the acquisition of so much happiness, I
could not help reproaching myself for contributing to render her I
loved unworthy: on the contrary, with Madam de Lamage, I was
proud of my happiness, and gave in to it without repugnance, while
my triumph redoubled every other charm.
I do not recollect exactly where we quitted the marquis, who
resided in this country, but I know we were alone on our arrival at
Montelimar, where Madam de Larnage made her chambermaid get
into my chaise, and accommodate me with a seat in hers. It will
easily be believed, that travelling in this manner was by no means
displeasing to me, and that I should be very much puzzled to give
any account of the country we passed through. She had some
business at Montelimar, which detained her there two or three days;
during this time she quitted me but one quarter of an hour, for a visit
she could not avoid, which embarrassed her with a number of
invitations she had no inclination to accept, and therefore excused

herself by pleading some indisposition; though she took care this
should not prevent our walking together every day, in the most
charming country, and under the finest sky imaginable. Oh! these
three days! what reason have I to regret them! Never did such
happiness return again.
The amours of a journey cannot be very durable: it was necessary
we should part, and I must confess it was almost time; not that I was
weary of my happiness, but I might as well have been. We
endeavored to comfort each other for the pain of parting, by forming
plans for our reunion; and it was concluded, that after staying five or
six weeks at Montpelier (which would give Madam de Larnage time
to prepare for my reception in such a manner as to prevent scandal)
I should return to Saint-Andiol, and spend the winter under her
direction. She gave me ample instruction on what it was necessary I
should know, on what it would be proper to say; and how I should
conduct myself. She spoke much and earnestly on the care of my
health, conjured me to consult skilful physicians, and be attentive
and exact in following their prescriptions whatever they might
happen to be. I believe her concern was sincere, for she loved me,
and gave proofs of her affection less equivocal than the prodigality of
her favors; for judging by my mode of travelling, that I was not in very
affluent circumstances (though not rich herself), on our parting, she
would have had me share the contents of her purse, which she had
brought pretty well furnished from Grenoble, and it was with great
difficulty I could make her put up with a denial. In a word, we parted;
my heart full of her idea, and leaving in hers (if I am not mistaken) a
firm attachment to me.
While pursuing the remainder of my journey, remembrance ran
over everything that had passed from the commencement of it, and I
was well satisfied at finding myself alone in a comfortable chaise,
where I could ruminate at ease on the pleasures I had enjoyed, and
those which awaited my return. I only thought of Saint-Andiol; of the
life I was to lead there; I saw nothing but Madam de Larnage, or
what related to her; the whole universe besides was nothing to me-even Madam de Warrens was forgotten!--I set about combining all
the details by which Madam de Larnage had endeavored to give me

in advance an idea of her house, of the neighborhood, of her
connections, and manner of life, finding everything charming.
She had a daughter, whom she had often described in the
warmest terms of maternal affection: this daughter was fifteen lively,
charming, and of an amiable disposition. Madam de Larnage
promised me her friendship; I had not forgotten that promise, and
was curious to know how Mademoiselle de Larnage would treat her
mother's 'bon ami'. These were the subjects of my reveries from the
bridge of St. Esprit to Remoulin: I had been advised to visit the Pontdu-Gard; hitherto I had seen none of the remaining monuments of
Roman magnificence, and I expected to find this worthy the hands
by which it was constructed; for once, the reality surpassed my
expectation; this was the only time in my life it ever did so, and the
Romans alone could have produced that effect. The view of this
noble and sublime work, struck me the more forcibly, from being in
the midst of a desert, where silence and solitude render the majestic
edifice more striking, and admiration more lively, for though called a
bridge it is nothing more than an aqueduct. One cannot help
exclaiming, what strength could have transported these enormous
stones so far from any quarry? And what motive could have united
the labors of so many millions of men, in a place that no one
inhabited? I remained here whole hours, in the most ravishing
contemplation, and returned pensive and thoughtful to my inn. This
reverie was by no means favorable to Madam de Larnage; she had
taken care to forewarn me against the girls of Montpelier, but not
against the Pont-du-Gard--it is impossible to provide for every
contingency.
On my arrival at Nismes, I went to see the amphitheatre, which is
a far more magnificent work than even the Pont-du-Gard, yet it made
a much less impression on me, perhaps, because my admiration had
been already exhausted on the former object; or that the situation of
the latter, in the midst of a city, was less proper to excite it. This vast
and superb circus is surrounded by small dirty houses, while yet
smaller and dirtier fill up the area, in such a manner that the whole
produces an unequal and confused effect, in which regret and
indignation stifle pleasure and surprise. The amphitheatre at Verona
is a vast deal smaller, and less beautiful than that at Nismes, but

preserved with all possible care and neatness, by which means
alone it made a much stronger and more agreeable impression on
me. The French pay no regard to these things, respect no monument
of antiquity; ever eager to undertake, they never finish, nor preserve
anything that is already finished to their hands.
I was so much better, and had gained such an appetite by
exercise, that I stopped a whole day at Pont-du-Lunel, for the sake of
good entertainment and company, this being deservedly esteemed
at that time the best inn in Europe; for those who kept it, knowing
how to make its fortunate situation turn to advantage, took care to
provide both abundance and variety. It was really curious to find in a
lonely country-house, a table every day furnished with sea and freshwater fish, excellent game, and choice wines, served up with all the
attention and care, which are only to be expected among the great or
opulent, and all this for thirty five sous each person: but the Pont-duLunel did not long remain on this footing, for the proprietor,
presuming too much on its reputation, at length lost it entirely.
During this journey, I really forgot my complaints, but recollected
them again on my arrival at Montpelier. My vapors were absolutely
gone, but every other complaint remained, and though custom had
rendered them less troublesome, they were still sufficient to make
any one who had been suddenly seized with them, suppose himself
attacked by some mortal disease. In effect they were rather alarming
than painful, and made the mind suffer more than the body, though it
apparently threatened the latter with destruction. While my attention
was called off by the vivacity of my passions, I paid no attention to
my health; but as my complaints were not altogether imaginary, I
thought of them seriously when the tumult had subsided.
Recollecting the salutary advice of Madam de Larnage, and the
cause of my journey, I consulted the most famous practitioners,
particularly Monsieur Fizes; and through superabundance of
precaution boarded at a doctor's who was an Irishman, and named
Fitz-Morris.
This person boarded a number of young gentlemen who were
studying physic; and what rendered his house very commodious for
an invalid, he contented himself with a moderate pension for
provisions, lodging, etc., and took nothing of his boarders for

attendance as a physician. He even undertook to execute the orders
of M. Fizes, and endeavored to re-establish my health. He certainly
acquitted himself very well in this employment; as to regimen,
indigestions were not to be gained at his table; and though I am not
much hurt at privations of that kind, the objects of comparison were
so near, that I could not help thinking with myself sometimes, that M.
de Torignan was a much better provider than M. Fitz-Morris;
notwithstanding, as there was no danger of, dying with hunger, and
all the youths were gay and good-humored, I believe this manner of
living was really serviceable, and prevented my falling into those
languors I had latterly been so subject to. I passed the morning in
taking medicines, particularly, I know not what kind of waters, but
believe they were those of Vals, and in writing to Madam de
Larnage: for the correspondence was regularly kept up, and
Rousseau kindly undertook to receive these letters for his good
friend Dudding. At noon I took a walk to the Canourgue, with some of
our young boarders, who were all very good lads; after this we
assembled for dinner; when this was over, an affair of importance
employed the greater part of us till night; this was going a little way
out of town to take our afternoon's collation, and make up two or
three parties at mall, or mallet. As I had neither strength nor skill, I
did not play myself but I betted on the game, and, interested for the
success of my wager, followed the players and their balls over rough
and stony roads, procuring by this means both an agreeable and
salutary exercise. We took our afternoon's refreshment at an inn out
of the city. I need not observe that these meetings were extremely
merry, but should not omit that they were equally innocent, though
the girls of the house were very pretty. M. Fitz-Morris (who was a
great mall player himself) was our president; and I must observe,
notwithstanding the imputation of wildness that is generally
bestowed on students, that I found more virtuous dispositions among
these youths than could easily be found among an equal number of
men: they were rather noisy than fond of wine, and more merry than
libertine.
I accustomed myself so much to this mode of life, and it accorded
so entirely with my humor, that I should have been very well content
with a continuance of it. Several of my fellow-boarders were Irish,

from whom I endeavored to learn some English words, as a
precaution for Saint-Andiol. The time now drew near for my
departure; every letter Madam de Larnage wrote, she entreated me
not to delay it, and at length I prepared to obey her.
I was convinced that the physicians (who understood nothing of
my disorder) looked on my complaint as imaginary, and treated me
accordingly, with their waters and whey. In this respect physicians
and philosophers differ widely from theologians; admitting the truth
only of what they can explain, and making their knowledge the
measure of possibilities. These gentlemen understood nothing of my
illness, therefore concluded I could not be ill; and who would
presume to doubt the profound skill of a physician? I plainly saw they
only meant to amuse, and make me swallow my money; and judging
their substitute at Saint-Andiol would do me quite as much service,
and be infinitely more agreeable, I resolved to give her the
preference; full, therefore, of this wise resolution, I quitted
Montpelier.
I set off towards the end of November, after a stay of six weeks or
two months in that city, where I left a dozen louis, without either my
health or understanding being the better for it, except from a short
course of anatomy begun under M. Fitz-Morris, which I was soon
obliged to abandon, from the horrid stench of the bodies he
dissected, which I found it impossible to endure.
Not thoroughly satisfied in my own mind on the rectitude of this
expedition, as I advanced towards the Bridge of St. Esprit (which
was equally the road to Saint-Andiol and to Chambery) I began to
reflect on Madam de Warrens, the remembrance of whose letters,
though less frequent than those from Madam de Larnage, awakened
in my heart a remorse that passion had stifled in the first part of my
journey, but which became so lively on my return, that, setting just
estimate on the love of pleasure, I found myself in such a situation of
mind that I could listen wholly to the voice of reason. Besides, in
continuing to act the part of an adventurer, I might be less fortunate
than I had been in the beginning; for it was only necessary that in all
Saint-Andiol there should be one person who had been in England,
or who knew the English or anything of their language, to prove me
an impostor. The family of Madam de Larnage might not be pleased

with me, and would, perhaps, treat me unpolitely; her daughter too
made me uneasy, for, spite of myself, I thought more of her than was
necessary. I trembled lest I should fall in love with this girl, and that
very fear had already half done the business. Was I going, in return
for the mother's kindness, to seek the ruin of the daughter? To sow
dissension, dishonor, scandal, and hell itself, in her family? The very
idea struck me with horror, and I took the firmest resolution to
combat and vanquish this unhappy attachment, should I be so
unfortunate as to experience it. But why expose myself to this
danger? How miserable must the situation be to live with the mother,
whom I should be weary of, and sigh for the daughter, without daring
to make known my affection! What necessity was there to seek this
situation, and expose myself to misfortunes, affronts and remorse,
for the sake of pleasures whose greatest charm was already
exhausted? For I was sensible this attachment had lost its first
vivacity. With these thoughts were mingled reflections relative to my
situation and duty to that good and generous friend, who already
loaded with debts, would become more so from the foolish expenses
I was running into, and whom I was deceiving so unworthily. This
reproach at length became so keen that it triumphed over every
temptation, and on approaching the bridge of St. Esprit I formed the
resolution to burn my whole magazine of letters from Saint-Andiol,
and continue my journey right forward to Chambery.
I executed this resolution courageously, with some sighs I confess,
but with the heart-felt satisfaction, which I enjoyed for the first time in
my life, of saying, "I merit my own esteem, and know how to prefer
duty to pleasure." This was the first real obligation I owed my books,
since these had taught me to reflect and compare. After the virtuous
principles I had so lately adopted, after all the rules of wisdom and
honor I had proposed to myself, and felt so proud to follow, the
shame of possessing so little stability, and contradicting so
egregiously my own maxims, triumphed over the allurements of
pleasure. Perhaps, after all, pride had as much share in my
resolution as virtue; but if this pride is not virtue itself, its effects are
so similar that we are pardonable in deceiving ourselves.
One advantage resulting from good actions is that they elevate the
soul to a disposition of attempting still better; for such is human

weakness, that we must place among our good deeds an abstinence
from those crimes we are tempted to commit. No sooner was my
resolution confirmed than I became another man, or rather, I became
what I was before I had erred, and saw in its true colors what the
intoxication of the moment had either concealed or disguised. Full of
worthy sentiments and wise resolutions, I continued my journey,
intending to regulate my future conduct by the laws of virtue, and
dedicate myself without reserve to that best of friends, to whom I
vowed as much fidelity in future as I felt real attachment. The
sincerity of this return to virtue appeared to promise a better destiny;
but mine, alas! was fixed, and already begun: even at the very
moment when my heart, full of good and virtuous sentiments, was
contemplating only innocence and happiness through life, I touched
on the fatal period that was to draw after it the long chain of my
misfortunes!
My impatience to arrive at Chambery had made me use more
diligence than I meant to do. I had sent a letter from Valence,
mentioning the day and hour I should arrive, but I had gained half a
day on this calculation, which time I passed at Chaparillan, that I
might arrive exactly at the time I mentioned. I wished to enjoy to its
full extent the pleasure of seeing her, and preferred deferring this
happiness a little, that expectancy might increase the value of it. This
precaution had always succeeded; hitherto my arrival had caused a
little holiday; I expected no less this time, and these preparations, so
dear to me, would have been well worth the trouble of contriving
them.
I arrived then exactly at the hour, and while at a considerable
distance, looked forward with an expectancy of seeing her on the
road to meet me. The beating of my heart increased as I drew near
the house; at length I arrived, quite out of breath; for I had left my
chaise in the town. I see no one in the garden, at the door, or at the
windows; I am seized with terror, fearful that some accident has
happened. I enter; all is quiet; the laborers are eating their luncheon
in the kitchen, and far from observing any preparation, the servants
seem surprised to see me, not knowing I was expected. I go up-stairs, at length see her!--that dear friend! so tenderly, truly, and
entirely beloved. I instantly ran towards her, and threw myself at her

feet. "Ah! child!" said she, "art thou returned then!" embracing me at
the same time. "Have you had a good journey? How do you do?"
This reception amused me for some moments. I then asked, whether
she had received my letter? she answered "Yes."--"I should have
thought not," replied I; and the information concluded there. A young
man was with her at this time. I recollected having seen him in the
house before my departure, but at present he seemed established
there; in short, he was so; I found my place already supplied!
This young man came from the country of Vaud; his father, named
Vintzenried, was keeper of the prison, or, as he expressed himself,
Captain of the Castle of Chillon. This son of the captain was a
journeyman peruke-maker, and gained his living in that capacity
when he first presented himself to Madam de Warrens, who received
him kindly, as she did all comers, particularly those from her own
country. He was a tall, fair, silly youth; well enough made, with an
unmeaning face, and a mind of the same description, speaking
always like the beau in a comedy, and mingling the manners and
customs of his former situation with a long history of his gallantry and
success; naming, according to his account, not above half the
marchionesses who had favored him and pretending never to have
dressed the head of a pretty woman, without having likewise
decorated her husband's; vain, foolish, ignorant and insolent; such
was the worthy substitute taken in my absence, and the companion
offered me on my return!
O! if souls disengaged from their terrestrial bonds, yet view from
the bosom of eternal light what passes here below, pardon, dear and
respectable shade, that I show no more favor to your failings than
my own, but equally unveil both. I ought and will be just to you as to
myself; but how much less will you lose by this resolution than I
shall! How much do your amiable and gentle disposition, your
inexhaustible goodness of heart, your frankness and other amiable
virtues, compensate for your foibles, if a subversion of reason alone
can be called such. You had errors, but not vices; your conduct was
reprehensible, but your heart was ever pure.
The new-comer had shown himself zealous and exact in all her
little commissions, which were ever numerous, and he diligently
overlooked the laborers. As noisy and insolent as I was quiet and

forbearing, he was seen or rather heard at the plough, in the hay-loft,
wood-house, stable, farm-yard, at the same instant. He neglected
the gardening, this labor being too peaceful and moderate; his chief
pleasure was to load or drive the cart, to saw or cleave wood; he
was never seen without a hatchet or pick-axe in his hand, running,
knocking and hallooing with all his might. I know not how many
men's labor he performed, but he certainly made noise enough for
ten or a dozen at least. All this bustle imposed on poor Madam de
Warrens; she thought this young man a treasure, and, willing to
attach him to herself, employed the means she imagined necessary
for that purpose, not forgetting what she most depended on, the
surrender of her person.
Those who have thus far read this work should be able to form
some judgment of my heart; its sentiments were the most constant
and sincere, particularly those which had brought me back to
Chambery; what a sudden and complete overthrow was this to my
whole being! but to judge fully of this, the reader must place himself
for a moment in my situation. I saw all the future felicity I had
promised myself vanish in a moment; all the charming ideas I had
indulged so affectionately, disappear entirely; and I, who even from
childhood had not been able to consider my existence for a moment
as separate from hers, for the first time saw myself utterly alone.
This moment was dreadful, and those that succeeded it were ever
gloomy. I was yet young, but the pleasing sentiments of enjoyment
and hope, which enliven youth, were extinguished. From that hour
my existence seemed half annihilated. I contemplated in advance
the melancholy remains of an insipid life, and if at any time an image
of happiness glanced through my mind, it was not that which
appeared natural to me, and I felt that even should I obtain it I must
still be wretched.
I was so dull of apprehension, and my confidence in her was so
great, that, notwithstanding the familiar tone of the new-comer, which
I looked on as an effect of the easy disposition of Madam de
Warrens, which rendered her free with everyone, I never should
have suspected his real situation had not she herself informed me of
it; but she hastened to make this avowal with a freedom calculated to
inflame me with resentment, could my heart have turned to that

point. Speaking of this connection as quite immaterial with respect to
herself, she reproached me with negligence in the care of the family,
and mentioned my frequent absence, as though she had been in
haste to supply my place. "Ah!" said I, my heart bursting with the
most poignant grief, "what do you dare to inform me of? Is this the
reward of an attachment like mine? Have you so many times
preserved my life, for the sole purpose of taking from me all that
could render it desirable? Your infidelity will bring me to the grave,
but you will regret my loss!" She answered with a tranquillity
sufficient to distract me, that I talked like a child; that people did not
die from such slight causes; that our friendship need be no less
sincere, nor we any less intimate, for that her tender attachment to
me could neither diminish nor end but with herself; in a word she
gave me to understand that my happiness need not suffer any
decrease from the good fortune of this new favorite.
Never did the purity, truth and force of my attachment to her
appear more evident; never did I feel the sincerity and honesty of my
soul more forcibly, than at that moment. I threw myself at her feet,
embracing her knees with torrents of tears. "No, madam," replied I,
with the most violent agitation, "I love you too much to disgrace you
thus far, and too truly to share you; the regret that accompanied the
first acquisition of your favors has continued to increase with my
affection. I cannot preserve them by so violent an augmentation of it.
You shall ever have my adoration: be worthy of it; to me that is more
necessary than all you can bestow. It is to you, O my dearest friend!
that I resign my rights; it is to the union of our hearts that I sacrifice
my pleasure; rather would I perish a thousand times than thus
degrade her I love."
I preserved this resolution with a constancy worthy, I may say, of
the sentiment that gave it birth. From this moment I saw this beloved
woman but with the eyes of a real son. It should be remarked here,
that this resolve did not meet her private approbation, as I too well
perceived; yet she never employed the least art to make me
renounce it either by insinuating proposals, caresses, or any of those
means which women so well know how to employ without exposing
themselves to violent censure, and which seldom fail to succeed.
Reduced to seek a fate independent of hers, and not able to devise

one, I passed to the other extreme, placing my happiness so
absolutely in her, that I became almost regardless of myself. The
ardent desire to see her happy, at any rate, absorbed all my
affections; it was in vain she endeavored to separate her felicity from
mine, I felt I had a part in it, spite of every impediment.
Thus those virtues whose seeds in my heart begun to spring up
with my misfortunes: they had been cultivated by study, and only
waited the fermentation of adversity to become prolific. The first-fruit
of this disinterested disposition was to put from my heart every
sentiment of hatred and envy against him who had supplanted me. I
even sincerely wished to attach myself to this young man; to form
and educate him; to make him sensible of his happiness, and, if
possible, render him worthy of it; in a word, to do for him what Anet
had formerly done for me. But the similarity of dispositions was
wanting. More insinuating and enlightened than Anet, I possessed
neither his coolness, fortitude, nor commanding strength of
character, which I must have had in order to succeed. Neither did the
young man possess those qualities which Anet found in me; such as
gentleness, gratitude, and above all, the knowledge of a want of his
instructions, and an ardent desire to render them useful. All these
were wanting; the person I wished to improve, saw in me nothing but
an importunate, chattering pedant: while on the contrary he admired
his own importance in the house, measuring the services he thought
he rendered by the noise he made, and looking on his saws,
hatchets, and pick-axes, as infinitely more useful than all my old
books: and, perhaps, in this particular, he might not be altogether
blamable; but he gave himself a number of airs sufficient to make
anyone die with laughter. With the peasants he assumed the airs of
a country gentleman; presently he did as much with me, and at
length with Madam de Warrens herself. His name, Vintzenried, did
not appear noble enough, he therefore changed it to that of Monsieur
de Courtilles, and by the latter appellation he was known at
Chambery, and in Maurienne, where he married.
At length this illustrious personage gave himself such airs of
consequence, that he was everything in the house, and myself
nothing. When I had the misfortune to displease him, he scolded
Madam de Warrens, and a fear of exposing her to his brutality

rendered me subservient to all his whims, so that every time he
cleaved wood (an office which he performed with singular pride) it
was necessary I should be an idle spectator and admirer of his
prowess. This lad was not, however, of a bad disposition; he loved
Madam de Warrens, indeed it was impossible to do otherwise; nor
had he any aversion even to me, and when he happened to be out of
his airs would listen to our admonitions, and frankly own he was a
fool; yet notwithstanding these acknowledgements his follies
continued in the same proportion. His knowledge was so contracted,
and his inclinations so mean, that it was useless to reason, and
almost impossible to be pleased with him. Not content with a most
charming woman, he amused himself with an old red-haired,
toothless waiting-maid, whose unwelcome service Madam de
Warrens had the patience to endure, though it was absolutely
disgusting. I soon perceived this new inclination, and was
exasperated at it; but I saw something else, which affected me yet
more, and made a deeper impression on me than anything had
hitherto done; this was a visible coldness in the behavior of Madam
de Warrens towards me.
The privation I had imposed on myself, and which she affected to
approve, is one of those affronts which women scarcely ever forgive.
Take the most sensible; the most philosophic female, one the least
attached to pleasure, and slighting her favors, if within your reach,
will be found the most unpardonable crime, even though she may
care nothing for the man. This rule is certainly without exception;
since a sympathy so natural and ardent was impaired in her, by an
abstinence founded only on virtue, attachment and esteem, I no
longer found with her that union of hearts which constituted all the
happiness of mine; she seldom sought me but when we had
occasion to complain of this new-comer, for when they were agreed,
I enjoyed but little of her confidence, and, at length, was scarcely
ever consulted in her affairs. She seemed pleased, indeed, with my
company, but had I passed whole days without seeing her she would
hardly have missed me.
Insensibly, I found myself desolate and alone in that house where I
had formerly been the very soul; where, if I may so express myself, I
had enjoyed a double life, and by degrees, I accustomed myself to

disregard everything that, passed, and even those who dwelt there.
To avoid continual mortifications, I shut myself up with my books, or
else wept and sighed unnoticed in the woods. This life soon became
insupportable; I felt that the presence of a woman so dear to me,
while estranged from her heart, increased my unhappiness, and was
persuaded, that, ceasing to see her, I should feel myself less cruelly
separated.
I resolved, therefore, to quit the house, mentioned it to her, and
she, far from opposing my resolution, approved it. She had an
acquaintance at Grenoble, called Madam de Deybens, whose
husband was on terms of friendship with Monsieur Malby, chief
Provost of Lyons. M. Deybens proposed my educating M. Malby's
children; I accepted this offer, and departed for Lyons without
causing, and almost without feeling, the least regret at a separation,
the bare idea of which, a few months before, would have given us
both the most excruciating torments.
I had almost as much knowledge as was necessary for a tutor, and
flattered myself that my method would be unexceptionable; but the
year I passed at M. Malby's was sufficient to undeceive me in that
particular. The natural gentleness of my disposition seemed
calculated for the employment, if hastiness had not been mingled
with it. While things went favorably, and I saw the pains (which I did
not spare) succeed, I was an angel; but a devil when they went
contrary. If my pupils did not understand me, I was hasty, and when
they showed any symptoms of an untoward disposition, I was so
provoked that I could have killed them; which behavior was not likely
to render them either good or wise. I had two under my care, and
they were of very different tempers. St. Marie, who was between
eight and nine years old, had a good person and quick
apprehension, was giddy, lively, playful and mischievous; but his
mischief was ever good-humored. The younger one, named
Condillac, appeared stupid and fretful, was headstrong as a mule,
and seemed incapable of instruction. It may be supposed that
between both I did not want employment, yet with patience and
temper I might have succeeded; but wanting both, I did nothing
worth mentioning, and my pupils profited very little. I could only make
use of three means, which are very weak, and often pernicious with

children; namely, sentiment, reasoning, passion. I sometimes
exerted myself so much with St. Marie, that I could not refrain from
tears, and wished to excite similar sensations in him; as if it was
reasonable to suppose a child could be susceptible to such
emotions. Sometimes I exhausted myself in reasoning, as if
persuaded he could comprehend me; and as he frequently formed
very subtle arguments, concluded he must be reasonable, because
he bid fair to be so good a logician.
The little Condillac was still more embarrassing; for he neither
understood, answered, nor was concerned at anything; he was of an
obstinacy beyond belief, and was never happier than when he had
succeeded in putting me in a rage; then, indeed, he was the
philosopher, and I the child. I was conscious of all my faults, studied
the tempers of my pupils, and became acquainted with them; but
where was the use of seeing the evil, without being able to apply a
remedy? My penetration was unavailing, since it never prevented
any mischief; and everything I undertook failed, because all I did to
effect my designs was precisely what I ought not to have done.
I was not more fortunate in what had only reference to myself,
than in what concerned my pupils. Madam Deybens, in
recommending me to her friend Madam de Malby, had requested her
to form my manners, and endeavor to give me an air of the world.
She took some pains on this account, wishing to teach me how to do
the honors of the house; but I was so awkward, bashful, and stupid,
that she found it necessary to stop there. This, however, did not
prevent me from falling in love with her, according to my usual
custom; I even behaved in such a manner, that she could not avoid
observing it; but I never durst declare my passion; and as the lady
never seemed in a humor to make advances, I soon became weary
of my sighs and ogling, being convinced they answered no manner
of purpose.
I had quite lost my inclination for little thieveries while with Madam
de Warrens; indeed, as everything belonged to me, there was
nothing to steal; besides, the elevated notions I had imbibed ought to
have rendered me in future above such meanness, and generally
speaking they certainly did so; but this rather proceeded from my
having learned to conquer temptations, than having succeeded in

rooting out the propensity, and I should even now greatly dread
stealing, as in my infancy, were I yet subject to the same inclinations.
I had a proof of this at M. Malby's, when, though surrounded by a
number of little things that I could easily have pilfered, and which
appeared no temptation, I took it into my head to covert some white
Arbois wine, some glasses of which I had drank at table, and thought
delicious. It happened to be rather thick, and as I fancied myself an
excellent finer of wine, I mentioned my skill, and this was accordingly
trusted to my care, but in attempting to mend, I spoiled it, though to
the sight only, for it remained equally agreeable to the taste. Profiting
by this opportunity, I furnished myself from time to time with a few
bottles to drink in my own apartment; but unluckily, I could never
drink without eating; the difficulty lay therefore, in procuring bread. It
was impossible to make a reserve of this article, and to have it
brought by the footman was discovering myself, and insulting the
master of the house; I could not bear to purchase it myself; how
could a fine gentleman, with a sword at his side, enter a baker's
shop to buy a small loaf of bread? it was utterly impossible. At length
I recollected the thoughtless saying of a great princess, who, on
being informed that the country people had no bread, replied, "Then
let them eat pastry!" Yet even this resource was attended with a
difficulty. I sometimes went out alone for this very purpose, running
over the whole city, and passing thirty pastry cook's shops, without
daring to enter any one of them. In the first place, it was necessary
there should be only one person in the shop, and that person's
physiognomy must be so encouraging as to give me confidence to
pass the threshold; but when once the dear little cake was procured,
and I shut up in my chamber with that and a bottle of wine, taken
cautiously from the bottom of a cupboard, how much did I enjoy
drinking my wine, and reading a few pages of a novel; for when I
have no company I always wish to read while eating; it seems a
substitute for society, and I dispatch alternately a page and a morsel;
'tis indeed, as if my book dined with me.
I was neither dissolute nor sottish, never in my whole life having
been intoxicated with liquor; my little thefts were not very indiscreet,
yet they were discovered; the bottles betrayed me, and though no
notice was taken of it, I had no longer the management of the cellar.

In all this Monsieur Malby conducted himself with prudence and
politeness, being really a very deserving man, who, under a manner
as harsh as his employment, concealed a real gentleness of
disposition and uncommon goodness of heart: he was judicious,
equitable, and (what would not be expected from an officer of the
Marechausse) very humane.
Sensible of his indulgence, I became greatly attached to him,
which made my stay at Lyons longer than it would otherwise have
been; but at length, disgusted with an employment which I was not
calculated for, and a situation of great confinement, consequently
disagreeable to me, after a year's trial, during which time I spared no
pains to fulfill my engagement, I determined to quit my pupils; being
convinced I should never succeed in educating them properly.
Monsieur Malby saw this as clearly as myself, though I am inclined
to think he would never have dismissed me had I not spared him the
trouble, which was an excess of condescension in this particular, that
I certainly cannot justify.
What rendered my situation yet more insupportable was the
comparison I was continually drawing between the life I now led and
that which I had quitted; the remembrance of my dear Charmettes,
my garden, trees, fountain and orchard, but, above all, the company
of her who was born to give life and soul to every other enjoyment.
On calling to mind our pleasures and innocent life, I was seized with
such oppressions and heaviness of heart, as deprived me of the
power of performing anything as it should be. A hundred times was I
tempted instantly to set off on foot to my dear Madam de Warrens,
being persuaded that could I once more see her, I should be content
to die that moment: in fine, I could no longer resist the tender
emotions which recalled me back to her, whatever it might cost me. I
accused myself of not having been sufficiently patient, complaisant
and kind; concluding I might yet live happily with her on the terms of
tender friendship, and by showing more for her than I had hitherto
done. I formed the finest projects in the world, burned to execute
them, left all, renounced everything, departed, fled, and arriving in all
the transports of my early youth, found myself once more at her feet.
Alas! I should have died there with joy, had I found in her reception,

in her embrace, or in her heart, one-quarter of what I had formerly
found there, and which I yet found the undiminished warmth of.
Fearful illusions of transitory things, how often dost thou torment
us in vain! She received me with that excellence of heart which could
only die with her; but I sought the influence there which could never
be recalled, and had hardly been half an hour with her before I was
once more convinced that my former happiness had vanished
forever, and that I was in the same melancholy situation which I had
been obliged to fly from; yet without being able to accuse any person
with my unhappiness, for Courtilles really was not to blame,
appearing to see my return with more pleasure than dissatisfaction.
But how could I bear to be a secondary person with her to whom I
had been everything, and who could never cease being such to me?
How could I live an alien in that house where I had been the child?
The sight of every object that had been witness to my former
happiness, rendered the comparison yet more distressing; I should
have suffered less in any other habitation, for this incessantly
recalled such pleasing remembrances, that it was irritating the
recollection of my loss.
Consumed with vain regrets, given up to the most gloomy
melancholy, I resumed the custom of remaining alone, except at
meals; shut up with my books, I sought to give some useful diversion
to my ideas, and feeling the imminent danger of want, which I had so
long dreaded, I sought means to prepare for and receive it, when
Madam de Warrens should have no other resource. I had placed her
household on a footing not to become worse; but since my departure
everything had been altered. He who now managed her affairs was a
spendthrift, and wished to make a great appearance; such as
keeping a good horse with elegant trappings; loved to appear gay in
the eyes of the neighbors, and was perpetually undertaking
something he did not understand. Her pension was taken up in
advance, her rent was in arrears, debts of every kind continued to
accumulate; I could plainly foresee that her pension would be seized,
and perhaps suppressed; in short, I expected nothing but ruin and
misfortune, and the moment appeared to approach so rapidly that I
already felt all its horrors.

My closet was my only amusement, and after a tedious search for
remedies for the sufferings of my mind, I determined to seek some
against the evil of distressing circumstances, which I daily expected
would fall upon us, and returning to my old chimeras, behold me
once more building castles in the air to relieve this dear friend from
the cruel extremities into which I saw her ready to fall. I did not
believe myself wise enough to shine in the republic of letters, or to
stand any chance of making a fortune by that means; a new idea,
therefore, inspired me with that confidence, which the mediocrity of
my talents could not impart.
In ceasing to teach music I had not abandoned the thoughts of it;
on the contrary, I had studied the theory sufficiently to consider
myself well informed on the subject. When reflecting on the trouble it
had cost me to read music, and the great difficulty I yet experienced
in singing at sight, I began to think the fault might as well arise from
the manner of noting as from my own dulness, being sensible it was
an art which most people find difficult to understand. By examining
the formation of the signs, I was convinced they were frequently very
ill devised. I had before thought of marking the gamut by figures, to
prevent the trouble of having lines to draw, on noting the plainest air;
but had been stopped by the difficulty of the octaves, and by the
distinction of measure and quantity: this idea returned again to my
mind, and on a careful revision of it, I found the difficulties by no
means insurmountable. I pursued it successfully, and was at length
able to note any music whatever by figures, with the greatest
exactitude and simplicity. From this moment I supposed my fortune
made, and in the ardor of sharing it with her to whom I owed
everything, thought only of going to Paris, not doubting that on
presenting my project to the Academy, it would be adopted with
rapture. I had brought some money from Lyons; I augmented this
stock by the sale of my books, and in the course of a fortnight my
resolution was both formed and executed: in short, full of the
magnificent ideas it had inspired, and which were common to me on
every occasion, I departed from Savoy with my new system of
music, as I had formerly done from Turin with my heron-fountain.
Such have been the errors and faults of my youth; I have related
the history of them with a fidelity which my heart approves; if my

riper years were dignified with some virtues, I should have related
them with the same frankness; it was my intention to have done this,
but I must forego this pleasing task and stop here. Time, which
renders justice to the characters of most men, may withdraw the veil;
and should my memory reach posterity, they may one day discover
what I had to say--they will then understand why I am now silent.

After two years' silence and patience, and notwithstanding my
resolutions, I again take up my pen: Reader, suspend your judgment
as to the reasons which force me to such a step: of these you can be
no judge until you shall have read my book.
My peaceful youth has been seen to pass away calmly and
agreeably without any great disappointments or remarkable
prosperity. This mediocrity was mostly owing to my ardent yet feeble
nature, less prompt in undertaking than easy to discourage; quitting
repose for violent agitations, but returning to it from lassitude and
inclinations, and which, placing me in an idle and tranquil state for
which alone I felt I was born, at a distance from the paths of great
virtues and still further from those of great vices, never permitted me
to arrive at anything great, either good or bad. What a different
account will I soon have to give of myself! Fate, which for thirty years
forced my inclinations, for thirty others has seemed to oppose them;
and this continued opposition, between my situation and inclinations,
will appear to have been the source of enormous faults, unheard of
misfortunes, and every virtue except that fortitude which alone can
do honor to adversity.
The history of the first part of my life was written from memory, and
is consequently full of errors. As I am obliged to write the second
part from memory also, the errors in it will probably be still more
numerous. The agreeable remembrance of the finest portion of my
years, passed with so much tranquillity and innocence, has left in my
heart a thousand charming impressions which I love incessantly to
call to my recollection. It will soon appear how different from these
those of the rest of my life have been. To recall them to my mind

would be to renew their bitterness. Far from increasing that of my
situation by these sorrowful reflections, I repel them as much as
possible, and in this endeavor often succeed so well as to be unable
to find them at will. This facility of forgetting my misfortunes is a
consolation which Heaven has reserved to me in the midst of those
which fate has one day to accumulate upon my head. My memory,
which presents to me no objects but such as are agreeable, is the
happy counterpoise of my terrified imagination, by which I foresee
nothing but a cruel futurity.
All the papers I had collected to aid my recollection, and guide me
in this undertaking, are no longer in my possession, nor can I ever
again hope to regain them.
I have but one faithful guide on which I can depend: this is the
chain of the sentiments by which the succession of my existence has
been marked, and by these the events which have been either the
cause or the effect of the manner of it. I easily forget my misfortunes,
but I cannot forget my faults, and still less my virtuous sentiments.
The remembrance of these is too dear to me ever to suffer them to
be effaced from my mind. I may omit facts, transpose events, and fall
into some errors of dates; but I cannot be deceived in what I have
felt, nor in that which from sentiment I have done; and to relate this is
the chief end of my present work. The real object of my confessions
is to communicate an exact knowledge of what I interiorly am and
have been in every situation of my life. I have promised the history of
my mind, and to write it faithfully I have no need of other memoirs: to
enter into my own heart, as I have hitherto done, will alone be
sufficient.
There is, however, and very happily, an interval of six or seven
years, relative to which I have exact references, in a collection of
letters copied from the originals, in the hands of M. du Peyrou. This
collection, which concludes in
, comprehends the whole time of
my residence at the hermitage, and my great quarrel with those who
called themselves my friends; that memorable epocha of my life, and
the source of all my other misfortunes. With respect to more recent
original letters which may remain in my possession, and are but few
in number, instead of transcribing them at the end of this collection,
too voluminous to enable me to deceive the vigilance of my Arguses,

I will copy them into the work whenever they appear to furnish any
explanation, be this either for or against myself; for I am not under
the least apprehension lest the reader should forget I make my
confession, and be induced to believe I make my apology; but he
cannot expect I shall conceal the truth when it testifies in my favor.
The second part, it is likewise to be remembered, contains nothing
in common with the first, except truth; nor has any other advantage
over it, but the importance of the facts; in everything else, it is inferior
to the former. I wrote the first with pleasure, with satisfaction, and at
my ease, at Wootton, or in the castle Trie: everything I had to
recollect was a new enjoyment. I returned to my closet with an
increased pleasure, and, without constraint, gave that turn to my
descriptions which most flattered my imagination.
At present my head and memory are become so weak as to
render me almost incapable of every kind of application: my present
undertaking is the result of constraint, and a heart full of sorrow. I
have nothing to treat of but misfortunes, treacheries, perfidies, and
circumstances equally afflicting. I would give the world, could I bury
in the obscurity of time, every thing I have to say, and which, in spite
of myself, I am obliged to relate. I am, at the same time, under the
necessity of being mysterious and subtle, of endeavoring to impose
and of descending to things the most foreign to my nature. The
ceiling under which I write has eyes; the walls of my chamber have
ears. Surrounded by spies and by vigilant and malevolent inspectors,
disturbed, and my attention diverted, I hastily commit to paper a few
broken sentences, which I have scarcely time to read, and still less
to correct. I know that, notwithstanding the barriers which are
multiplied around me, my enemies are afraid truth should escape by
some little opening. What means can I take to introduce it to the
world? This, however, I attempt with but few hopes of success. The
reader will judge whether or not such a situation furnishes the means
of agreeable descriptions, or of giving them a seductive coloring! I
therefore inform such as may undertake to read this work, that
nothing can secure them from weariness in the prosecution of their
task, unless it be the desire of becoming more fully acquainted with a
man whom they already know, and a sincere love of justice and
truth.

In my first part I brought down my narrative to my departure with
infinite regret from Paris, leaving my heart at Charmettes, and, there
building my last castle in the air, intending some day to return to the
feet of mamma, restored to herself, with the treasures I should have
acquired, and depending upon my system of music as upon a certain
fortune.
I made some stay at Lyons to visit my acquaintance, procure
letters of recommendation to Paris, and to sell my books of geometry
which I had brought with me. I was well received by all whom I knew.
M. and Madam de Malby seemed pleased to see me again, and
several times invited me to dinner. At their house I became
acquainted with the Abbe de Malby, as I had already done with the
Abbe de Condillac, both of whom were on a visit to their brother. The
Abbe de Malby gave me letters to Paris; among others, one to M. de
Pontenelle, and another to the Comte de Caylus. These were very
agreeable acquaintances, especially the first, to whose friendship for
me his death only put a period, and from whom, in our private
conversations, I received advice which I ought to have more exactly
followed.
I likewise saw M. Bordes, with whom I had been long acquainted,
and who had frequently obliged me with the greatest cordiality and
the most real pleasure. He it was who enabled me to sell my books;
and he also gave me from himself good recommendations to Paris. I
again saw the intendant for whose acquaintance I was indebted to
M. Bordes, and who introduced me to the Duke de Richelieu, who
was then passing through Lyons. M. Pallu presented me. The Duke
received me well, and invited me to come and see him at Paris; I did
so several times; although this great acquaintance, of which I shall
frequently have occasion to speak, was never of the most trifling
utility to me.
I visited the musician David, who, in one of my former journeys,
and in my distress, had rendered me service. He had either lent or
given me a cap and a pair of stockings, which I have never returned,
nor has he ever asked me for them, although we have since that
time frequently seen each other. I, however, made him a present,
something like an equivalent. I would say more upon this subject,

were what I have owned in question; but I have to speak of what I
have done, which, unfortunately, is far from being the same thing.
I also saw the noble and generous Perrichon, and not without
feeling the effects of his accustomed munificence; for he made me
the same present he had previously done to the elegant Bernard, by
paying for my place in the diligence. I visited the surgeon Parisot, the
best and most benevolent of men; as also his beloved Godefroi, who
had lived with him ten years, and whose merit chiefly consisted in
her gentle manners and goodness of heart. It was impossible to see
this woman without pleasure, or to leave her without regret. Nothing
better shows the inclinations of a man, than the nature of his
attachments.
[Unless he be deceived in his choice, or that she, to whom
he
attaches himself, changes her character by an
extraordinary
concurrence of causes, which is not absolutely impossible.
Were
this consequence to be admitted without modification,
Socrates must
be judged of by his wife Xantippe, and Dion by his friend
Calippus,
which would be the most false and iniquitous judgment ever
made.
However, let no injurious application be here made to my
wife. She
is weak and more easily deceived than I at first imagined,
but by
her pure and excellent character she is worthy of all my
esteem.]
Those who had once seen the gentle Godefroi, immediately knew
the good and amiable Parisot.
I was much obliged to all these good people, but I afterwards
neglected them all; not from ingratitude, but from that invincible
indolence which so often assumes its appearance. The

remembrance of their services has never been effaced from my
mind, nor the impression they made from my heart; but I could more
easily have proved my gratitude, than assiduously have shown them
the exterior of that sentiment. Exactitude in correspondence is what I
never could observe; the moment I began to relax, the shame and
embarrassment of repairing my fault made me aggravate it, and I
entirely desist from writing; I have, therefore, been silent, and
appeared to forget them. Parisot and Perrichon took not the least
notice of my negligence, and I ever found them the same. But,
twenty years afterwards it will be seen, in M. Bordes, to what a
degree the self-love of a wit can make him carry his vengeance
when he feels himself neglected.
Before I leave Lyons, I must not forget an amiable person, whom I
again saw with more pleasure than ever, and who left in my heart the
most tender remembrance. This was Mademoiselle Serre, of whom I
have spoken in my first part; I renewed my acquaintance with her
whilst I was at M. de Malby's.
Being this time more at leisure, I saw her more frequently, and she
made the most sensible impressions on my heart. I had some
reason to believe her own was not unfavorable to my pretensions;
but she honored me with her confidence so far as to remove from
me all temptation to allure her partiality.
She had no fortune, and in this respect exactly resembled myself;
our situations were too similar to permit us to become united; and
with the views I then had, I was far from thinking of marriage. She
gave me to understand that a young merchant, one M. Geneve,
seemed to wish to obtain her hand. I saw him once or twice at her
lodgings; he appeared to me to be an honest man, and this was his
general character. Persuaded she would be happy with him, I was
desirous he should marry her, which he afterwards did; and that I
might not disturb their innocent love, I hastened my departure;
offering up, for the happiness of that charming woman, prayers,
which, here below were not long heard. Alas! her time was very
short, for I afterwards heard she died in the second or third year after
her marriage. My mind, during the journey, was wholly absorbed in
tender regret. I felt, and since that time, when these circumstances
have been present to my recollection, have frequently done the

same; that although the sacrifices made to virtue and our duty may
sometimes be painful, we are well rewarded by the agreeable
remembrance they leave deeply engravers in our hearts.
I this time saw Paris in as favorable a point of view as it had
appeared to me in an unfavorable one at my first journey; not that
my ideas of its brilliancy arose from the splendor of my lodgings; for
in consequence of an address given me by M. Bordes, I resided at
the Hotel St. Quentin, Rue des Cordier, near the Sorbonne; a vile
street, a miserable hotel, and a wretched apartment: but
nevertheless a house in which several men of merit, such as
Gresset, Bordes, Abbe Malby, Condillac, and several others, of
whom unfortunately I found not one, had taken up their quarters; but
I there met with M. Bonnefond, a man unacquainted with the world,
lame, litigious, and who affected to be a purist. To him I owe the
acquaintance of M. Roguin, at present the oldest friend I have and
by whose means I became acquainted with Diderot, of whom I shall
soon have occasion to say a good deal.
I arrived at Paris in the autumn of
, with fifteen louis in my
purse, and with my comedy of Narcissus and my musical project in
my pocket. These composed my whole stock; consequently I had not
much time to lose before I attempted to turn the latter to some
advantage. I therefore immediately thought of making use of my
recommendations.
A young man who arrives at Paris, with a tolerable figure, and
announces himself by his talents, is sure to be well received. This
was my good fortune, which procured me some pleasure without
leading to anything solid. Of all the persons to whom I was
recommended, three only were useful to me. M. Damesin, a
gentleman of Savoy, at that time equerry, and I believe favorite, of
the Princess of Carignan; M. de Boze, Secretary of the Academy of
Inscriptions, and keeper of the medals of the king's cabinet; and
Father Castel, a Jesuit, author of the 'Clavecin oculaire'.--[ocular
harpsichord.]
All these recommendations, except that to M. Damesin, were
given me by the Abbe de Malby.
M. Damesin provided me with that which was most needful, by
means of two persons with whom he brought me acquainted. One

was M. Gase, 'president a mortier' of the parliament of Bordeaux,
and who played very well upon the violin; the other, the Abbe de
Leon, who then lodged in the Sorbonne, a young nobleman;
extremely amiable, who died in the flower of his age, after having, for
a few moments, made a figure in the world under the name of the
Chevalier de Rohan. Both these gentlemen had an inclination to
learn composition. In this I gave them lessons for a few months, by
which means my decreasing purse received some little aid. The
Abbe Leon conceived a friendship for me, and wished me to become
his secretary; but he was far from being rich, and all the salary he
could offer me was eight hundred livres, which, with infinite regret, I
refused; since it was insufficient to defray the expenses of my
lodging, food, and clothing.
I was well received by M. de Boze. He had a thirst for knowledge,
of which he possessed not a little, but was somewhat pedantic.
Madam de Boze much resembled him; she was lively and affected. I
sometimes dined with them, and it is impossible to be more awkward
than I was in her presence. Her easy manner intimidated me, and
rendered mine more remarkable. When she presented me a plate, I
modestly put forward my fork to take one of the least bits of what she
offered me, which made her give the plate to her servant, turning her
head aside that I might not see her laugh. She had not the least
suspicion that in the head of the rustic with whom she was so
diverted there was some small portion of wit. M. de Boze presented
me to M. de Reaumur, his friend, who came to dine with him every
Friday, the day on which the Academy of Sciences met. He
mentioned to him my project, and the desire I had of having it
examined by the academy. M. de Reaumur consented to make the
proposal, and his offer was accepted. On the day appointed I was
introduced and presented by M. de Reaumur, and on the same day,
August d,
, I had the honor to read to the academy the
memoir I had prepared for that purpose. Although this illustrious
assembly might certainly well be expected to inspire me with awe, I
was less intimidated on this occasion than I had been in the
presence of Madam de Boze, and I got tolerably well through my
reading and the answers I was obliged to give. The memoir was well
received, and acquired me some compliments by which I was

equally surprised and flattered, imagining that before such an
assembly, whoever was not a member of it could not have
commonsense. The persons appointed to examine my system were
M. Mairan, M. Hellot, and M. de Fouchy, all three men of merit, but
not one of them understood music, at least not enough of
composition to enable them to judge of my project.
During my conference with these gentlemen, I was convinced with
no less certainty than surprise, that if men of learning have
sometimes fewer prejudices than others, they more tenaciously
retain those they have. However weak or false most of their
objections were, and although I answered them with great timidity,
and I confess, in bad terms, yet with decisive reasons, I never once
made myself understood, or gave them any explanation in the least
satisfactory. I was constantly surprised at the facility with which, by
the aid of a few sonorous phrases, they refuted, without having
comprehended me. They had learned, I know not where, that a
monk of the name of Souhaitti had formerly invented a mode of
noting the gamut by ciphers: a sufficient proof that my system was
not new. This might, perhaps, be the case; for although I had never
heard of Father Souhaitti, and notwithstanding his manner of writing
the seven notes without attending to the octaves was not, under any
point of view, worthy of entering into competition with my simple and
commodious invention for easily noting by ciphers every possible
kind of music, keys, rests, octaves, measure, time, and length of
note; things on which Souhaitti had never thought it was
nevertheless true, that with respect to the elementary expression of
the seven notes, he was the first inventor.
But besides their giving to this primitive invention more importance
than was due to it, they went still further, and, whenever they spoke
of the fundamental principles of the system, talked nonsense. The
greatest advantage of my scheme was to supersede transpositions
and keys, so that the same piece of music was noted and
transposed at will by means of the change of a single initial letter at
the head of the air. These gentlemen had heard from the music-masters of Paris that the method of executing by transposition was a
bad one; and on this authority converted the most evident advantage
of my system into an invincible objection against it, and affirmed that

my mode of notation was good for vocal music, but bad for
instrumental; instead of concluding as they ought to have done, that
it was good for vocal, and still better for instrumental. On their report
the academy granted me a certificate full of fine compliments, amidst
which it appeared that in reality it judged my system to be neither
new nor useful. I did not think proper to ornament with such a paper
the work entitled 'Dissertation sur la musique moderne', by which I
appealed to the public.
I had reason to remark on this occasion that, even with a narrow
understanding, the sole but profound knowledge of a thing is
preferable for the purpose of judging of it, to all the lights resulting
from a cultivation of the sciences, when to these a particular study of
that in question has not been joined. The only solid objection to my
system was made by Rameau. I had scarcely explained it to him
before he discovered its weak part. "Your signs," said he, "are very
good inasmuch as they clearly and simply determine the length of
notes, exactly represent intervals, and show the simple in the double
note, which the common notation does not do; but they are
objectionable on account of their requiring an operation of the mind,
which cannot always accompany the rapidity of execution. The
position of our notes," continued he, "is described to the eye without
the concurrence of this operation. If two notes, one very high and the
other very low, be joined by a series of intermediate ones, I see at
the first glance the progress from one to the other by conjoined
degrees; but in your system, to perceive this series, I must
necessarily run over your ciphers one after the other; the glance of
the eye is here useless." The objection appeared to me
insurmountable, and I instantly assented to it. Although it be simple
and striking, nothing can suggest it but great knowledge and practice
of the art, and it is by no means astonishing that not one of the
academicians should have thought of it. But what creates much
surprise is, that these men of great learning, and who are supposed
to possess so much knowledge, should so little know that each
ought to confine his judgment to that which relates to the study with
which he has been conversant.
My frequent visits to the literati appointed to examine my system
and the other academicians gave me an opportunity of becoming

acquainted with the most distinguished men of letters in Paris, and
by this means the acquaintance that would have been the
consequence of my sudden admission amongst them, which
afterwards came to pass, was already established. With respect to
the present moment, absorbed in my new system of music, I
obstinately adhered to my intention of effecting a revolution in the
art, and by that means of acquiring a celebrity which, in the fine arts,
is in Paris mostly accompanied by fortune. I shut myself in my
chamber and labored three or four months with inexpressible ardor,
in forming into a work for the public eye, the memoir I had read
before the academy. The difficulty was to find a bookseller to take my
manuscript; and this on account of the necessary expenses for new
characters, and because booksellers give not their money by
handfuls to young authors; although to me it seemed but just my
work should render me the bread I had eaten while employed in its
composition.
Bonnefond introduced me to Quillau the father, with whom I
agreed to divide the profits, without reckoning the privilege, of which
I paid the whole expense. Such were the future proceedings of this
Quillau that I lost the expenses of my privilege, never having
received a farthing from that edition; which, probably, had but very
middling success, although the Abbe des Fontaines promised to give
it celebrity, and, notwithstanding the other journalists, had spoken of
it very favorably.
The greatest obstacle to making the experiment of my system was
the fear, in case of its not being received, of losing the time
necessary to learn it. To this I answered, that my notes rendered the
ideas so clear, that to learn music by means of the ordinary
characters, time would be gained by beginning with mine. To prove
this by experience, I taught music gratis to a young American lady,
Mademoiselle des Roulins, with whom M. Roguin had brought me
acquainted. In three months she read every kind of music, by means
of my notation, and sung at sight better than I did myself, any piece
that was not too difficult. This success was convincing, but not
known; any other person would have filled the journals with the
detail, but with some talents for discovering useful things, I never
have possessed that of setting them off to advantage.

Thus was my airy castle again overthrown; but this time I was
thirty years of age, and in Paris, where it is impossible to live for a
trifle. The resolution I took upon this occasion will astonish none but
those by whom the first part of these memoirs has not been read
with attention. I had just made great and fruitless efforts, and was in
need of relaxation. Instead of sinking with despair I gave myself up
quietly to my indolence and to the care of Providence; and the better
to wait for its assistance with patience, I lay down a frugal plan for
the slow expenditure of a few louis, which still remained in my
possession, regulating the expense of my supine pleasures without
retrenching it; going to the coffee-house but every other day, and to
the theatre but twice a week. With respect to the expenses of girls of
easy virtue, I had no retrenchment to make; never having in the
whole course of my life applied so much as a farthing to that use
except once, of which I shall soon have occasion to speak. The
security, voluptuousness, and confidence with which I gave myself
up to this indolent and solitary life, which I had not the means of
continuing for three months, is one of the singularities of my life, and
the oddities of my disposition. The extreme desire I had, the public
should think of me was precisely what discouraged me from showing
myself; and the necessity of paying visits rendered them to such a
degree insupportable, that I ceased visiting the academicians and
other men of letters, with whom I had cultivated an acquaintance.
Marivaux, the Abbe Malby, and Fontenelle, were almost the only
persons whom I sometimes went to see. To the first I showed my
comedy of Narcissus. He was pleased with it, and had the goodness
to make in it some improvements. Diderot, younger than these, was
much about my own age. He was fond of music, and knew it
theoretically; we conversed together, and he communicated to me
some of his literary projects. This soon formed betwixt us a more
intimate connection, which lasted fifteen years, and which probably
would still exist were not I, unfortunately, and by his own fault, of the
same profession with himself.
It would be impossible to imagine in what manner I employed this
short and precious interval which still remained to me, before
circumstances forced me to beg my bread:--in learning by memory
passages from the poets which I had learned and forgotten a

hundred times. Every morning at ten o'clock, I went to walk in the
Luxembourg with a Virgil and a Rousseau in my pocket, and there,
until the hour of dinner, I passed away the time in restoring to my
memory a sacred ode or a bucolic, without being discouraged by
forgetting, by the study of the morning, what I had learned the
evening before. I recollected that after the defeat of Nicias at
Syracuse the captive Athenians obtained a livelihood by reciting the
poems of Homer. The use I made of this erudition to ward off misery
was to exercise my happy memory by learning all the poets by rote.
I had another expedient, not less solid, in the game of chess, to
which I regularly dedicated, at Maugis, the evenings on which I did
not go to the theatre. I became acquainted with M. de Legal, M.
Husson, Philidor, and all the great chess players of the day, without
making the least improvement in the game. However, I had no doubt
but, in the end, I should become superior to them all, and this, in my
own opinion, was a sufficient resource. The same manner of
reasoning served me in every folly to which I felt myself inclined. I
said to myself: whoever excels in anything is sure to acquire a
distinguished reception in society. Let us therefore excel, no matter
in what, I shall certainly be sought after; opportunities will present
themselves, and my own merit will do the rest. This childishness was
not the sophism of my reason; it was that of my indolence. Dismayed
at the great and rapid efforts which would have been necessary to
call forth my endeavors, I strove to flatter my idleness, and by
arguments suitable to the purpose, veiled from my own eyes the
shame of such a state.
I thus calmly waited for the moment when I was to be without
money; and had not Father Castel, whom I sometimes went to see in
my way to the coffee-house, roused me from my lethargy, I believe I
should have seen myself reduced to my last farthing without the
least emotion. Father Castel was a madman, but a good man upon
the whole; he was sorry to see me thus impoverish myself to no
purpose. "Since musicians and the learned," said he, "do not sing by
your scale, change the string, and apply to the women. You will
perhaps succeed better with them. I have spoken of you to Madam
de Beuzenval; go to her from me; she is a good woman who will be
glad to see the countryman of her son and husband. You will find at

her house Madam de Broglie, her daughter, who is a woman of wit.
Madam Dupin is another to whom I also have mentioned you; carry
her your work; she is desirous of seeing you, and will receive you
well. No thing is done in Paris without the women. They are the
curves, of which the wise are the asymptotes; they incessantly
approach each other, but never touch."
After having from day to day delayed these very disagreeable
steps, I at length took courage, and called upon Madam de
Beuzenval. She received me with kindness; and Madam de Broglio
entering the chamber, she said to her: "Daughter, this is M.
Rousseau, of whom Father Castel has spoken to us." Madam de
Broglie complimented me upon my work, and going to her
harpsichord proved to me she had already given it some attention.
Perceiving it to be about one o'clock, I prepared to take my leave.
Madam de Beuzenval said to me: "You are at a great distance from
the quarter of the town in which you reside; stay and dine here." I did
not want asking a second time. A quarter of an hour afterwards, I
understood, by a word, that the dinner to which she had invited me
was that of her servants' hall. Madam de Beuzenval was a very good
kind of woman, but of a confined understanding, and too full of her
illustrious Polish nobility: she had no idea of the respect due to
talents. On this occasion, likewise, she judged me by my manner
rather than by my dress, which, although very plain, was very neat,
and by no means announced a man to dine with servants. I had too
long forgotten the way to the place where they eat to be inclined to
take it again. Without suffering my anger to appear, I told Madam de
Beuzenval that I had an affair of a trifling nature which I had just
recollected obliged me to return home, and I immediately prepared
to depart. Madam de Broglie approached her mother, and whispered
in her ear a few words which had their effect. Madam de Beuzenval
rose to prevent me from going, and said, "I expect that you will do us
the honor to dine with us." In this case I thought to show pride would
be a mark of folly, and I determined to stay. The goodness of Madam
de Broglie had besides made an impression upon me, and rendered
her interesting in my eyes. I was very glad to dine with her, and
hoped, that when she knew me better, she would not regret having
procured me that honor. The President de Lamoignon, very intimate

in the family, dined there also. He, as well as Madam de Broglie, was
a master of all the modish and fashionable small talk jargon of Paris.
Poor Jean Jacques was unable to make a figure in this way. I had
sense enough not to pretend to it, and was silent. Happy would it
have been for me, had I always possessed the same wisdom; I
should not be in the abyss into which I am now fallen. I was vexed at
my own stupidity, and at being unable to justify to Madam de Broglie
what she had done in my favor.
After dinner I thought of my ordinary resource. I had in my pocket
an epistle in verse, written to Parisot during my residence at Lyons.
This fragment was not without some fire, which I increased by my
manner of reading, and made them all three shed tears. Whether it
was vanity, or really the truth, I thought the eyes of Madam de
Broglie seemed to say to her mother: "Well, mamma, was I wrong in
telling you this man was fitter to dine with us than with your women?"
Until then my heart had been rather burdened, but after this revenge
I felt myself satisfied. Madam de Broglie, carrying her favorable
opinion of me rather too far, thought I should immediately acquire
fame in Paris, and become a favorite with fine ladies. To guide my
inexperience she gave me the confessions of the Count de -----.
"This book," said she, "is a Mentor, of which you will stand in need in
the great world. You will do well by sometimes consulting it." I kept
the book upwards of twenty years with a sentiment of gratitude to her
from whose hand I had received it, although I frequently laughed at
the opinion the lady seemed to have of my merit in gallantry. From
the moment I had read the work, I was desirous of acquiring the
friendship of the author. My inclination led me right; he is the only
real friend I ever possessed amongst men of letters.
[I have so long been of the same opinion, and so perfectly
convinced
of its being well founded, that since my return to Paris I
confided
to him the manuscript of my confessions. The suspicious J.
J.
never suspected perfidy and falsehood until he had been
their

victim.]
From this time I thought I might depend on the services of Madam
the Baroness of Beuzenval, and the Marchioness of Broglie, and that
they would not long leave me without resource. In this I was not
deceived. But I must now speak of my first visit to Madam Dupin,
which produced more lasting consequences.
Madam Dupin was, as every one in Paris knows, the daughter of
Samuel Bernard and Madam Fontaine. There were three sisters,
who might be called the three graces. Madam de la Touche who
played a little prank, and went to England with the Duke of Kingston.
Madam Darby, the eldest of the three; the friend, the only sincere
friend of the Prince of Conti; an adorable woman, as well by her
sweetness and the goodness of her charming character, as by her
agreeable wit and incessant cheerfulness. Lastly, Madam Dupin,
more beautiful than either of her sisters, and the only one who has
not been reproached with some levity of conduct.
She was the reward of the hospitality of M. Dupin, to whom her
mother gave her in marriage with the place of farmer general and an
immense fortune, in return for the good reception he had given her in
his province. When I saw her for the first time, she was still one of
the finest women in Paris. She received me at her toilette, her arms
were uncovered, her hair dishevelled, and her combing-cloth illarranged. This scene was new to me; it was too powerful for my poor
head, I became confused, my senses wandered; in short, I was
violently smitten by Madam Dupin.

My confusion was not prejudicial to me; she did not perceive it.
She kindly received the book and the author; spoke with information
of my plan, sung, accompanied herself on the harpsichord, kept me
to dinner, and placed me at table by her side. Less than this would
have turned my brain; I became mad. She permitted me to visit her,
and I abused the permission. I went to see her almost every day, and
dined with her twice or thrice a week. I burned with inclination to
speak, but never dared attempt it. Several circumstances increased
my natural timidity. Permission to visit in an opulent family was a
door open to fortune, and in my situation I was unwilling to run the
risk of shutting it against myself.
Madam Dupin, amiable as she was, was serious and unanimated;
I found nothing in her manners sufficiently alluring to embolden me.
Her house, at that time, as brilliant as any other in Paris, was
frequented by societies the less numerous, as the persons by whom
they were composed were chosen on account of some distinguished
merit. She was fond of seeing every one who had claims to a

marked superiority; the great men of letters, and fine women. No
person was seen in her circle but dukes, ambassadors, and blue
ribbons. The Princess of Rohan, the Countess of Forcalquier,
Madam de Mirepoix, Madam de Brignole, and Lady Hervey, passed
for her intimate friends. The Abbes de Fontenelle, de Saint Pierre,
and Saltier, M. de Fourmont, M. de Berms, M. de Buffon, and M. de
Voltaire, were of her circle and her dinners. If her reserved manner
did not attract many young people, her society inspired the greater
awe, as it was composed of graver persons, and the poor JeanJacques had no reason to flatter himself he should be able to take a
distinguished part in the midst of such superior talents. I therefore
had not courage to speak; but no longer able to contain myself, I
took a resolution to write. For the first two days she said not a word
to me upon the subject. On the third day, she returned me my letter,
accompanying it with a few exhortations which froze my blood. I
attempted to speak, but my words expired upon my lips; my sudden
passion was extinguished with my hopes, and after a declaration in
form I continued to live with her upon the same terms as before,
without so much as speaking to her even by the language of the
eyes.
I thought my folly was forgotten, but I was deceived. M. de
Francueil, son to M. Dupin, and son-in-law to Madam Dupin, was
much the same with herself and me. He had wit, a good person, and
might have pretensions. This was said to be the case, and probably
proceeded from his mother-in-law's having given him an ugly wife of
a mild disposition, with whom, as well as with her husband, she lived
upon the best of terms. M. de Francueil was fond of talents in others,
and cultivated those he possessed. Music, which he understood very
well, was a means of producing a connection between us. I
frequently saw him, and he soon gained my friendship. He, however,
suddenly gave me to understand that Madam Dupin thought my
visits too frequent, and begged me to discontinue them. Such a
compliment would have been proper when she returned my letter;
but eight or ten days afterwards, and without any new cause, it
appeared to me ill-timed. This rendered my situation the more
singular, as M. and Madam de Francueil still continued to give me
the same good reception as before.

I however made the intervals between my visits longer, and I
should entirely have ceased calling on them, had not Madam Dupin,
by another unexpected caprice, sent to desire I would for a few days
take care of her son, who changing his preceptor, remained alone
during that interval. I passed eight days in such torments as nothing
but the pleasure of obeying Madam Dupin could render supportable:
I would not have undertaken to pass eight other days like them had
Madam Dupin given me herself for the recompense.
M. de Francueil conceived a friendship for me, and I studied with
him. We began together a course of chemistry at Rouelles. That I
might be nearer at hand, I left my hotel at Quentin, and went to lodge
at the Tennis Court, Rue Verdelet, which leads into the Rue Platiere,
where M. Dupin lived. There, in consequence of a cold neglected, I
contracted an inflammation of the lungs that had liked to have
carried me off. In my younger days I frequently suffered from
inflammatory disorders, pleurisies, and especially quinsies, to which I
was very subject, and which frequently brought me near enough to
death to familiarize me to its image.
During my convalescence I had leisure to reflect upon my
situation, and to lament my timidity, weakness and indolence; these,
notwithstanding the fire with which I found myself inflamed, left me to
languish in an inactivity of mind, continually on the verge of misery.
The evening preceding the day on which I was taken ill, I went to an
opera by Royer; the name I have forgotten. Notwithstanding my
prejudice in favor of the talents of others, which has ever made me
distrustful of my own, I still thought the music feeble, and devoid of
animation and invention. I sometimes had the vanity to flatter myself:
I think I could do better than that. But the terrible idea I had formed of
the composition of an opera, and the importance I heard men of the
profession affix to such an undertaking, instantly discouraged me,
and made me blush at having so much as thought of it. Besides,
where was I to find a person to write the words, and one who would
give himself the trouble of turning the poetry to my liking? These
ideas of music and the opera had possession of my mind during my
illness, and in the delirium of my fever I composed songs, duets, and
choruses. I am certain I composed two or three little pieces, 'di prima
infenzione', perhaps worthy of the admiration of masters, could they

have heard them executed. Oh, could an account be taken of the
dreams of a man in a fever, what great and sublime things would
sometimes proceed from his delirium!
These subjects of music and opera still engaged my attention
during my convalescence, but my ideas were less energetic. Long
and frequent meditations, and which were often involuntary, and
made such an impression upon my mind that I resolved to attempt
both words and music. This was not the first time I had undertaken
so difficult a task. Whilst I was at Chambery I had composed an
opera entitled 'Iphis and Anaxarete', which I had the good sense to
throw into the fire. At Lyons I had composed another, entitled 'La
Decouverte du Nouveau Monde', which, after having read it to M.
Bordes, the Abbes Malby, Trublet, and others, had met the same
fate, notwithstanding I had set the prologue and the first act to music,
and although David, after examining the composition, had told me
there were passages in it worthy of Buononcini.
Before I began the work I took time to consider of my plan. In a
heroic ballet I proposed three different subjects, in three acts,
detached from each other, set to music of a different character,
taking for each subject the amours of a poet. I entitled this opera Les
Muses Galantes. My first act, in music strongly characterized, was
Tasso; the second in tender harmony, Ovid; and the third, entitled
Anacreon, was to partake of the gayety of the dithyrambus. I tried my
skill on the first act, and applied to it with an ardor which, for the first
time, made me feel the delightful sensation produced by the creative
power of composition. One evening, as I entered the opera, feeling
myself strongly incited and overpowered by my ideas, I put my
money again into my pocket, returned to my apartment, locked the
door, and, having close drawn all the curtains, that every ray of light
might be excluded, I went to bed, abandoning myself entirely to this
musical and poetical 'oestrum', and in seven or eight hours rapidly
composed the greatest part of an act. I can truly say my love for the
Princess of Ferrara (for I was Tasso for the moment) and my noble
and lofty sentiment with respect to her unjust brother, procured me a
night a hundred times more delicious than one passed in the arms of
the princess would have been. In the morning but a very little of what
I had done remained in my head, but this little, almost effaced by

sleep and lassitude, still sufficiently evinced the energy of the pieces
of which it was the scattered remains.
I this time did, not proceed far with my undertaking, being
interrupted by other affairs. Whilst I attached myself to the family of
Dupin, Madam de Beuzenval and Madam de Broglie, whom I
continued to visit, had not forgotten me. The Count de Montaigu,
captain in the guards, had just been appointed ambassador to
Venice. He was an ambassador made by Barjac, to whom he
assiduously paid his court. His brother, the Chevalier de Montaigu,
'gentilhomme de la manche' to the dauphin, was acquainted with
these ladies, and with the Abbe Alary of the French academy, whom
I sometimes visited. Madam de Broglie having heard the
ambassador was seeking a secretary, proposed me to him. A
conference was opened between us. I asked a salary of fifty
guineas, a trifle for an employment which required me to make some
appearance. The ambassador was unwilling to give more than a
thousand livres, leaving me to make the journey at my own expense.
The proposal was ridiculous. We could not agree, and M. de
Francueil, who used all his efforts to prevent my departure,
prevailed.
I stayed, and M. de Montaigu set out on his journey, taking with
him another secretary, one M. Follau, who had been recommended
to him by the office of foreign affairs. They no sooner arrived at
Venice than they quarrelled. Bollau perceiving he had to do with a
madman, left him there, and M. de Montaigu having nobody with
him, except a young abbe of the name of Binis, who wrote under the
secretary, and was unfit to succeed him, had recourse to me. The
chevalier, his brother, a man of wit, by giving me to understand there
were advantages annexed to the place of secretary, prevailed upon
me to accept the thousand livres. I was paid twenty louis in advance
for my journey, and immediately departed.
At Lyons I would most willingly have taken the road to Mount
Cenis, to see my poor mamma. But I went down the Rhone, and
embarked at Toulon, as well on account of the war, and from a
motive of economy, as to obtain a passport from M. de Mirepoix, who
then commanded in Provence, and to whom I was recommended. M.
de Montaigu not being able to do without me, wrote letter after letter,

desiring I would hasten my journey; this, however, an accident
considerably prolonged.
It was at the time of the plague at Messina, and the English fleet
had anchored there, and visited the Felucca, on board of which I
was, and this circumstance subjected us, on our arrival, after a long
and difficult voyage, to a quarantine of one--and--twenty days.
The passengers had the choice of performing it on board or in the
Lazaretto, which we were told was not yet furnished. They all chose
the Felucca. The insupportable heat, the closeness of the vessel, the
impossibility of walking in it, and the vermin with which it swarmed,
made me at all risks prefer the Lazaretto. I was therefore conducted
to a large building of two stories, quite empty, in which I found
neither window, bed, table, nor chair, not so much as even a jointstool or bundle of straw. My night sack and my two trunks being
brought me, I was shut in by great doors with huge locks, and
remained at full liberty to walk at my ease from chamber to chamber
and story to story, everywhere finding the same solitude and
nakedness.
This, however, did not induce me to repent that I had preferred the
Lazaretto to the Felucca; and, like another Robinson Crusoe, I
began to arrange myself for my one-and twenty days, just as I
should have done for my whole life. In the first place, I had the
amusement of destroying the vermin I had caught in the Felucca. As
soon as I had got clear of these, by means of changing my clothes
and linen, I proceeded to furnish the chamber I had chosen. I made
a good mattress with my waistcoats and shirts; my napkins I
converted, by sewing them together, into sheets; my robe de
chambre into a counterpane; and my cloak into a pillow. I made
myself a seat with one of my trunks laid flat, and a table with the
other. I took out some writing paper and an inkstand, and distributed,
in the manner of a library, a dozen books which I had with me. In a
word, I so well arranged my few movables, that except curtains and
windows, I was almost as commodiously lodged in this Lazeretto,
absolutely empty as it was, as I had been at the Tennis Court in the
Rue Verdelet. My dinners were served with no small degree of
pomp; they were escorted by two grenadiers with bayonets fixed; the
staircase was my dining--room, the landing-place my table, and the

steps served me for a seat; and as soon as my dinner was served up
a little bell was rung to inform me I might sit down to table.
Between my repasts, when I did not either read or write or work at
the furnishing of my apartment, I went to walk in the burying-ground
of the Protestants, which served me as a courtyard. From this place I
ascended to a lanthorn which looked into the harbor, and from which
I could see the ships come in and go out. In this manner I passed
fourteen days, and should have thus passed the whole time of the
quarantine without the least weariness had not M. Joinville, envoy
from France, to whom I found means to send a letter, vinegared,
perfumed, and half burnt, procured eight days of the time to be taken
off: these I went and spent at his house, where I confess I found
myself better lodged than in the Lazaretto. He was extremely civil to
me. Dupont, his secretary, was a good creature: he introduced me,
as well at Genoa as in the country, to several families, the company
of which I found very entertaining and agreeable; and I formed with
him an acquaintance and a correspondence which we kept up for a
considerable length of time. I continued my journey, very agreeably,
through Lombardy. I saw Milan, Verona, Brescie, and Padua, and at
length arrived at Venice, where I was impatiently expected by the
ambassador.
I found there piles of despatches, from the court and from other
ambassadors, the ciphered part of which he had not been able to
read, although he had all the ciphers necessary for that purpose,
never having been employed in any office, nor even seen the cipher
of a minister. I was at first apprehensive of meeting with some
embarrassment; but I found nothing could be more easy, and in less
than a week I had deciphered the whole, which certainly was not
worth the trouble; for not to mention the little activity required in the
embassy of Venice, it was not to such a man as M. de Montaigu that
government would confide a negotiation of even the most trifling
importance. Until my arrival he had been much embarrassed, neither
knowing how to dictate nor to write legibly. I was very useful to him,
of which he was sensible; and he treated me well. To this he was
also induced by another motive. Since the time of M. de Froulay, his
predecessor, whose head became deranged, the consul from
France, M. le Blond, had been charged with the affairs of the

embassy, and after the arrival of M. de Montaigu, continued to
manage them until he had put him into the track. M. de Montaigu,
hurt at this discharge of his duty by another, although he himself was
incapable of it, became disgusted with the consul, and as soon as I
arrived deprived him of the functions of secretary to the embassy to
give them to me. They were inseparable from the title, and he told
me to take it. As long as I remained with him he never sent any
person except myself under this title to the senate, or to conference,
and upon the whole it was natural enough he should prefer having
for secretary to the embassy a man attached to him, to a consul or a
clerk of office named by the court.
This rendered my situation very agreeable, and prevented his
gentlemen, who were Italians, as well as his pages, and most of his
suite from disputing precedence with me in his house. I made an
advantageous use of the authority annexed to the title he had
conferred upon me, by maintaining his right of protection, that is, the
freedom of his neighborhood, against the attempts several times
made to infringe it; a privilege which his Venetian officers took no
care to defend. But I never permitted banditti to take refuge there,
although this would have produced me advantages of which his
excellency would not have disdained to partake. He thought proper,
however, to claim a part of those of the secretaryship, which is called
the chancery. It was in time of war, and there were many passports
issued. For each of these passports a sequin was paid to the
secretary who made it out and countersigned it. All my predecessors
had been paid this sequin by Frenchmen and others without
distinction. I thought this unjust, and although I was not a
Frenchman, I abolished it in favor of the French; but I so rigorously
demanded my right from persons of every other nation, that the
Marquis de Scotti, brother to the favorite of the Queen of Spain,
having asked for a passport without taking notice of the sequin: I
sent to demand it; a boldness which the vindictive Italian did not
forget. As soon as the new regulation I had made, relative to
passports, was known, none but pretended Frenchmen, who in a
gibberish the most mispronounced, called themselves Provencals,
Picards, or Burgundians, came to demand them. My ear being very
fine, I was not thus made a dupe, and I am almost persuaded that

not a single Italian ever cheated me of my sequin, and that not one
Frenchman ever paid it. I was foolish enough to tell M. de Montaigu,
who was ignorant of everything that passed, what I had done. The
word sequin made him open his ears, and without giving me his
opinion of the abolition of that tax upon the French, he pretended I
ought to account with him for the others, promising me at the same
time equivalent advantages. More filled with indignation at this
meanness, than concern for my own interest, I rejected his proposal.
He insisted, and I grew warm. "No, sir," said I, with some heat, "your
excellency may keep what belongs to you, but do not take from me
that which is mine; I will not suffer you to touch a penny of the
perquisites arising from passports." Perceiving he could gain nothing
by these means he had recourse to others, and blushed not to tell
me that since I had appropriated to myself the profits of the
chancery, it was but just I should pay the expenses. I was unwilling
to dispute upon this subject, and from that time I furnished at my own
expense, ink, paper, wax, wax-candle, tape, and even a new seal,
for which he never reimbursed me to the amount of a farthing. This,
however, did not prevent my giving a small part of the produce of the
passports to the Abbe de Binis, a good creature, and who was far
from pretending to have the least right to any such thing. If he was
obliging to me my politeness to him was an equivalent, and we
always lived together on the best of terms.
On the first trial I made of his talents in my official functions, I
found him less troublesome than I expected he would have been,
considering he was a man without experience, in the service of an
ambassador who possessed no more than himself, and whose
ignorance and obstinacy constantly counteracted everything with
which common-sense and some information inspired me for his
service and that of the king. The next thing the ambassador did was
to connect himself with the Marquis Mari, ambassador from Spain,
an ingenious and artful man, who, had he wished so to do, might
have led him by the nose, yet on account of the union of the interests
of the two crowns he generally gave him good advice, which might
have been of essential service, had not the other, by joining his own
opinion, counteracted it in the execution. The only business they had
to conduct in concert with each other was to engage the Venetians to

maintain their neutrality. These did not neglect to give the strongest
assurances of their fidelity to their engagement at the same time that
they publicly furnished ammunition to the Austrian troops, and even
recruits under pretense of desertion. M. de Montaigu, who I believe
wished to render himself agreeable to the republic, failed not on his
part, notwithstanding my representation to make me assure the
government in all my despatches, that the Venetians would never
violate an article of the neutrality. The obstinacy and stupidity of this
poor wretch made me write and act extravagantly: I was obliged to
be the agent of his folly, because he would have it so, but he
sometimes rendered my employment insupportable and the
functions of it almost impracticable. For example, he insisted on the
greatest part of his despatches to the king, and of those to the
minister, being written in cipher, although neither of them contained
anything that required that precaution. I represented to him that
between the Friday, the day the despatches from the court arrived,
and Saturday, on which ours were sent off, there was not sufficient
time to write so much in cipher, and carry on the considerable
correspondence with which I was charged for the same courier. He
found an admirable expedient, which was to prepare on Thursday
the answer to the despatches we were expected to receive on the
next day. This appeared to him so happily imagined, that
notwithstanding all I could say on the impossibility of the thing, and
the absurdity of attempting its execution, I was obliged to comply
during the whole time I afterwards remained with him, after having
made notes of the few loose words he spoke to me in the course of
the week, and of some trivial circumstances which I collected by
hurrying from place to place. Provided with these materials I never
once failed carrying to him on the Thursday morning a rough draft of
the despatches which were to be sent off on Saturday, excepting the
few additions and corrections I hastily made in answer to the letters
which arrived on the Friday, and to which ours served for answer. He
had another custom, diverting enough and which made his
correspondence ridiculous beyond imagination. He sent back all
information to its respective source, instead of making it follow its
course. To M. Amelot he transmitted the news of the court; to M.
Maurepas, that of Paris; to M. d' Havrincourt, the news from

Sweden; to M. de Chetardie, that from Petersbourg; and sometimes
to each of those the news they had respectively sent to him, and
which I was employed to dress up in terms different from those in
which it was conveyed to us. As he read nothing of what I laid before
him, except the despatches for the court, and signed those to other
ambassadors without reading them, this left me more at liberty to
give what turn I thought proper to the latter, and in these therefore I
made the articles of information cross each other. But it was
impossible for-me to do the same by despatches of importance; and
I thought myself happy when M. de Montaigu did not take it into his
head to cram into them an impromptu of a few lines after his manner.
This obliged me to return, and hastily transcribe the whole despatch
decorated with his new nonsense, and honor it with the cipher,
without which he would have refused his signature. I was frequently
almost tempted, for the sake of his reputation, to cipher something
different from what he had written, but feeling that nothing could
authorize such a deception, I left him to answer for his own folly,
satisfying myself with having spoken to him with freedom, and
discharged at my own peril the duties of my station. This is what I
always did with an uprightness, a zeal and courage, which merited
on his part a very different recompense from that which in the end I
received from him. It was time I should once be what Heaven, which
had endowed me with a happy disposition, what the education that
had been given me by the best of women, and that I had given
myself, had prepared me for, and I became so. Left to my own
reflections, without a friend or advice, without experience, and in a
foreign country, in the service of a foreign nation, surrounded by a
crowd of knaves, who, for their own interest, and to avoid the
scandal of good example, endeavored to prevail upon me to imitate
them; far from yielding to their solicitations, I served France well, to
which I owed nothing, and the ambassador still better, as it was right
and just I should do to the utmost of my power. Irreproachable in a
post, sufficiently exposed to censure, I merited and obtained the
esteem of the republic, that of all the ambassadors with whom we
were in correspondence, and the affection of the French who resided
at Venice, not even excepting the consul, whom with regret I
supplanted in the functions which I knew belonged to him, and which

occasioned me more embarrassment than they afforded me
satisfaction.
M. de Montaigu, confiding without reserve to the Marquis Mari,
who did not thoroughly understand his duty, neglected it to such a
degree that without me the French who were at Venice would not
have perceived that an ambassador from their nation resided there.
Always put off without being heard when they stood in need of his
protection, they became disgusted and no longer appeared in his
company or at his table, to which indeed he never invited them. I
frequently did from myself what it was his duty to have done; I
rendered to the French, who applied to me, all the services in my
power. In any other country I should have done more, but, on
account of my employment, not being able to see persons in place, I
was often obliged to apply to the consul, and the consul, who was
settled in the country with his family, had many persons to oblige,
which prevented him from acting as he otherwise would have done.
However, perceiving him unwilling and afraid to speak, I ventured
hazardous measures, which sometimes succeeded. I recollect one
which still makes me laugh. No person would suspect it was to me,
the lovers of the theatre at Paris, owe Coralline and her sister
Camille, nothing however, can be more true. Veronese, their father,
had engaged himself with his children in the Italian company, and
after having received two thousand livres for the expenses of his
journey, instead of setting out for France, quietly continued at
Venice, and accepted an engagement in the theatre of Saint Luke, to
which Coralline, a child as she still was, drew great numbers of
people. The Duke de Greves, as first gentleman of the chamber,
wrote to the ambassador to claim the father and the daughter. M. de
Montaigu when he gave me the letter, confined his instructions to
saying, 'voyez cela', examine and pay attention to this. I went to M.
Blond to beg he would speak to the patrician, to whom the theatre
belonged, and who, I believe, was named Zustinian, that he might
discharge Veronese, who had engaged in the name of the king. Le
Blond, to whom the commission was not very agreeable, executed it
badly.
Zustinian answered vaguely, and Veronese was not discharged. I
was piqued at this. It was during the carnival, and having taken the

bahute and a mask, I set out for the palace Zustinian. Those who
saw my gondola arrive with the livery of the ambassador, were lost in
astonishment. Venice had never seen such a thing. I entered, and
caused myself to be announced by the name of 'Una Siora
Masehera'. As soon as I was introduced I took off my mask and told
my name. The senator turned pale and appeared stupefied with
surprise. "Sir;" said I to him in Venetian, "it is with much regret I
importune your excellency with this visit; but you have in your theatre
of Saint Luke, a man of the name of Veronese, who is engaged in
the service of the king, and whom you have been requested, but in
vain, to give up: I come to claim him in the name of his majesty." My
short harangue was effectual. I had no sooner left the palace than
Zustinian ran to communicate the adventure to the state inquisitors,
by whom he was severely reprehended. Veronese was discharged
the same day. I sent him word that if he did not set off within a week I
would have him arrested. He did not wait for my giving him this
intimation a second time.
On another occasion I relieved from difficulty solely by my own
means, and almost without the assistance of any other person, the
captain of a merchant-ship. This was one Captain Olivet, from
Marseilles; the name of the vessel I have forgotten. His men had
quarreled with the Sclavonians in the service of the republic, some
violence had been committed, and the vessel was under so severe
an embargo that nobody except the master was suffered to go on
board or leave it without permission. He applied to the ambassador,
who would hear nothing he had to say. He afterwards went to the
consul, who told him it was not an affair of commerce, and that he
could not interfere in it. Not knowing what further steps to take he
applied to me. I told M. de Montaigu he ought to permit me to lay
before the senate a memoir on the subject. I do not recollect whether
or not he consented, or that I presented the memoir; but I perfectly
remember that if I did it was ineffectual, and the embargo still
continuing, I took another method, which succeeded. I inserted a
relation of the affairs in one of our letters to M. de Maurepas, though
I had difficulty in prevailing upon M. de Montaigne to suffer the article
to pass.

I knew that our despatches, although their contents were
insignificant, were opened at Venice. Of this I had a proof by finding
the articles they contained, verbatim in the gazette, a treachery of
which I had in vain attempted to prevail upon the ambassador to
complain. My object in speaking of the affair in the letter was to turn
the curiosity of the ministers of the republic to advantage, to inspire
them with some apprehensions, and to induce the state to release
the vessel: for had it been necessary to this effect to wait for an
answer from the court, the captain would have been ruined before it
could have arrived. I did still more, I went alongside the vessel to
make inquiries of the ship's company. I took with me the Abbe
Patizel, chancellor of the consulship, who would rather have been
excused, so much were these poor creatures afraid of displeasing
the Senate. As I could not go on board, on account of the order from
the states, I remained in my gondola, and there took the depositions
successively, interrogating each of the mariners, and directing my
questions in such a manner as to produce answers which might be
to their advantage. I wished to prevail upon Patizel to put the
questions and take depositions himself, which in fact was more his
business than mine; but to this he would not consent; he never once
opened his mouth and refused to sign the depositions after me. This
step, somewhat bold, was however, successful, and the vessel was
released long before an answer came from the minister. The captain
wished to make me a present; but without being angry with him on
that account, I tapped him on the shoulder, saying, "Captain Olivet,
can you imagine that he who does not receive from the French his
perquisite for passports, which he found his established right, is a
man likely to sell them the king's protection?" He, however, insisted
on giving me a dinner on board his vessel, which I accepted, and
took with me the secretary to the Spanish embassy, M. Carrio, a
man of wit and amiable manners, to partake of it: he has since been
secretary to the Spanish embassy at Paris and charge des affaires. I
had formed an intimate connection with him after the example of our
ambassadors.
Happy should I have been, if, when in the most disinterested
manner I did all the service I could, I had known how to introduce
sufficient order into all these little details, that I might not have

served others at my own expense. But in employments similar to that
I held, in which the most trifling faults are of consequence, my whole
attention was engaged in avoiding all such mistakes as might be
detrimental to my service. I conducted, till the last moment,
everything relative to my immediate duty, with the greatest order and
exactness. Excepting a few errors which a forced precipitation made
me commit in ciphering, and of which the clerks of M. Amelot once
complained, neither the ambassador nor any other person had ever
the least reason to reproach me with negligence in any one of my
functions. This is remarkable in a man so negligent as I am. But my
memory sometimes failed me, and I was not sufficiently careful in the
private affairs with which I was charged; however, a love of justice
always made me take the loss on myself, and this voluntarily, before
anybody thought of complaining. I will mention but one circumstance
of this nature; it relates to my departure from Venice, and I
afterwards felt the effects of it in Paris.
Our cook, whose name was Rousselot, had brought from France
an old note for two hundred livres, which a hairdresser, a friend of
his, had received from a noble Venetian of the name of Zanetto Nani,
who had had wigs of him to that amount. Rousselot brought me the
note, begging I would endeavor to obtain payment of some part of it,
by way of accommodation. I knew, and he knew it also, that the
constant custom of noble Venetians was, when once returned to
their country, never to pay the debts they had contracted abroad.
When means are taken to force them to payment, the wretched
creditor finds so many delays, and incurs such enormous expenses,
that he becomes disgusted and concludes by giving up his debtor
accepting the most trifling composition. I begged M. le Blond to
speak to Zanetto. The Venetian acknowledged the note, but did not
agree to payment. After a long dispute he at length promised three
sequins; but when Le Blond carried him the note even these were
not ready, and it was necessary to wait. In this interval happened my
quarrel with the ambassador and I quitted his service. I had left the
papers of the embassy in the greatest order, but the note of
Rousselot was not to be found. M. le Blond assured me he had given
it me back. I knew him to be too honest a man to have the least
doubt of the matter; but it was impossible for me to recollect what I

had done with it. As Zanetto had acknowledged the debt, I desired
M. le Blond to endeavor to obtain from him the three sequins on
giving him a receipt for the amount, or to prevail upon him to renew
the note by way of duplicate. Zanetto, knowing the note to be lost,
would not agree to either. I offered Rousselot the three sequins from
my own purse, as a discharge of the debt. He refused them, and
said I might settle the matter with the creditor at Paris, of whom he
gave me the address. The hair-dresser, having been informed of
what had passed, would either have his note or the whole sum for
which it was given. What, in my indignation, would I have given to
have found this vexatious paper! I paid the two hundred livres, and
that in my greatest distress. In this manner the loss of the note
produced to the creditor the payment of the whole sum, whereas had
it, unfortunately for him, been found, he would have had some
difficulty in recovering even the ten crowns, which his excellency,
Zanetto Nani, had promised to pay.
The talents I thought I felt in myself for my employment made me
discharge the functions of it with satisfaction, and except the society
of my friend de Carrio, that of the virtuous Altuna, of whom I shall
soon have an occasion to speak, the innocent recreations of the
place Saint Mark, of the theatre, and of a few visits which we, for the
most part, made together, my only pleasure was in the duties of my
station. Although these were not considerable, especially with the aid
of the Abbe de Binis, yet as the correspondence was very extensive
and there was a war, I was a good deal employed. I applied to
business the greatest part of every morning, and on the days
previous to the departure of the courier, in the evenings, and
sometimes till midnight. The rest of my time I gave to the study of the
political professions I had entered upon, and in which I hoped, from
my successful beginning, to be advantageously employed. In fact I
was in favor with every one; the ambassador himself spoke highly of
my services, and never complained of anything I did for him; his
dissatisfaction proceeded from my having insisted on quitting him,
inconsequence of the useless complaints I had frequently made on
several occasions. The ambassadors and ministers of the king with
whom we were in correspondence complimented him on the merit of
his secretary, in a manner by which he ought to have been flattered,

but which in his poor head produced quite a contrary effect. He
received one in particular relative to an affair of importance, for
which he never pardoned me.
He was so incapable of bearing the least constraint, that on the
Saturday, the day of the despatches for most of the courts he could
not contain himself, and wait till the business was done before he
went out, and incessantly pressing me to hasten the despatches to
the king and ministers, he signed them with precipitation, and
immediately went I know not where, leaving most of the other letters
without signing; this obliged me, when these contained nothing but
news, to convert them into journals; but when affairs which related to
the king were in question it was necessary somebody should sign,
and I did it. This once happened relative to some important advice
we had just received from M. Vincent, charge des affaires from the
king, at Vienna. The Prince Lobkowitz was then marching to Naples,
and Count Gages had just made the most memorable retreat, the
finest military manoeuvre of the whole century, of which Europe has
not sufficiently spoken. The despatch informed us that a man, whose
person M. Vincent described, had set out from Vienna, and was to
pass by Venice, in his way into Abruzzo, where he was secretly to
stir up the people at the approach of the Austrians.
In the absence of M. le Comte de Montaigu, who did not give
himself the least concern about anything, I forwarded this advice to
the Marquis de l'Hopital, so apropos, that it is perhaps to the poor
Jean Jacques, so abused and laughed at, that the house of Bourbon
owes the preservation of the kingdom of Naples.
The Marquis de l'Hopital, when he thanked his colleague, as it was
proper he should do, spoke to him of his secretary, and mentioned
the service he had just rendered to the common cause. The Comte
de Montaigu, who in that affair had to reproach himself with
negligence, thought he perceived in the compliment paid him by M.
de l'Hopital, something like a reproach, and spoke of it to me with
signs of ill-humor. I found it necessary to act in the same manner
with the Count de Castellane, ambassador at Constantinople, as I
had done with the Marquis de l'Hopital, although in things of less
importance. As there was no other conveyance to Constantinople
than by couriers, sent from time to time by the senate to its Bailli,

advice of their departure was given to the ambassador of France,
that he might write by them to his colleague, if he thought proper so
to do. This advice was commonly sent a day or two beforehand; but
M. de Montaigu was held in so little respect, that merely for the sake
of form he was sent to, a couple of hours before the couriers set off.
This frequently obliged me to write the despatch in his absence. M.
de Castellane, in his answer made honorable mention of me; M. de
Jonville, at Genoa, did the same, and these instances of their regard
and esteem became new grievances.
I acknowledge I did not neglect any opportunity of making myself
known; but I never sought one improperly, and in serving well I
thought I had a right to aspire to the natural return for essential
services; the esteem of those capable of judging of, and rewarding
them. I will not say whether or not my exactness in discharging the
duties of my employment was a just subject of complaint from the
ambassador; but I cannot refrain from declaring that it was the sole
grievance he ever mentioned previous to our separation.
His house, which he had never put on a good footing, was
constantly filled with rabble; the French were ill-treated in it, and the
ascendancy was given to the Italians; of these even, the more
honest part, they who had long been in the service of the embassy,
were indecently discharged, his first gentleman in particular, whom
he had taken from the Comte de Froulay, and who, if I remember
right, was called Comte de Peati, or something very like that name.
The second gentleman, chosen by M. de Montaigu, was an outlaw
highwayman from Mantua, called Dominic Vitali, to whom the
ambassador intrusted the care of his house, and who had by means
of flattery and sordid economy, obtained his confidence, and became
his favorite to the great prejudice of the few honest people he still
had about him, and of the secretary who was at their head. The
countenance of an upright man always gives inquietude to knaves.
Nothing more was necessary to make Vitali conceive a hatred
against me: but for this sentiment there was still another cause which
rendered it more cruel. Of this I must give an account, that I may be
condemned if I am found in the wrong.
The ambassador had, according to custom, a box at each of the
theaters. Every day at dinner he named the theater to which it was

his intention to go: I chose after him, and the gentlemen disposed of
the other boxes. When I went out I took the key of the box I had
chosen. One day, Vitali not being in the way, I ordered the footman
who attended on me, to bring me the key to a house which I named
to him. Vitali, instead of sending the key, said he had disposed of it. I
was the more enraged at this as the footman delivered his message
in public. In the evening Vitali wished to make me some apology, to
which however I would not listen. "To--morrow, sir," said I to him,
"you will come at such an hour and apologize to me in the house
where I received the affront, and in the presence of the persons who
were witnesses to it; or after to--morrow, whatever may be the
consequences, either you or I will leave the house." This firmness
intimidated him. He came to the house at the hour appointed, and
made me a public apology, with a meanness worthy of himself. But
he afterwards took his measures at leisure, and at the same time
that he cringed to me in public, he secretly acted in so vile a manner,
that although unable to prevail on the ambassador to give me my
dismission, he laid me under the necessity of resolving to leave him.
A wretch like him, certainly, could not know me, but he knew
enough of my character to make it serviceable to his purposes. He
knew I was mild to an excess, and patient in bearing involuntary
wrongs; but haughty and impatient when insulted with premeditated
offences; loving decency and dignity in things in which these were
requisite, and not more exact in requiring the respect due to myself,
than attentive in rendering that which I owed to others. In this he
undertook to disgust me, and in this he succeeded. He turned the
house upside down, and destroyed the order and subordination I had
endeavored to establish in it. A house without a woman stands in
need of rather a severe discipline to preserve that modesty which is
inseparable from dignity. He soon converted ours into a place of
filthy debauch and scandalous licentiousness, the haunt of knaves
and debauchees. He procured for second gentleman to his
excellency, in the place of him whom he got discharged, another
pimp like himself, who kept a house of ill--fame, at the Cross of
Malta; and the indecency of these two rascals was equalled by
nothing but their insolence. Except the bed-chamber of the

ambassador, which, however, was not in very good order, there was
not a corner in the whole house supportable to an modest man.
As his excellency did not sup, the gentleman and myself had a
private table, at which the Abbe Binis and the pages also eat. In the
most paltry ale-house people are served with more cleanliness and
decency, have cleaner linen, and a table better supplied. We had but
one little and very filthy candle, pewter plates, and iron forks.
I could have overlooked what passed in secret, but I was deprived
of my gondola. I was the only secretary to an ambassador, who was
obliged to hire one or go on foot, and the livery of his excellency no
longer accompanied me, except when I went to the senate. Besides,
everything which passed in the house was known in the city. All
those who were in the service of the other ambassadors loudly
exclaimed; Dominic, the only cause of all, exclaimed louder than
anybody, well knowing the indecency with which we were treated
was more affecting to me than to any other person. Though I was the
only one in the house who said nothing of the matter abroad, I
complained loudly of it to the ambassador, as well as of himself,
who, secretly excited by the wretch, entirely devoted to his will, daily
made me suffer some new affront. Obliged to spend a good deal to
keep up a footing with those in the same situation with myself, and to
make are appearance proper to my employment, I could not touch a
farthing of my salary, and when I asked him for money, he spoke of
his esteem for me, and his confidence, as if either of these could
have filled my purse, and provided for everything.
These two banditti at length quite turned the head of their master,
who naturally had not a good one, and ruined him by a continual
traffic, and by bargains, of which he was the dupe, whilst they
persuaded him they were greatly in his favor. They persuaded him to
take upon the Brenta, a Palazzo, at twice the rent it was worth, and
divided the surplus with the proprietor. The apartments were inlaid
with mosaic, and ornamented with columns and pilasters, in the taste
of the country. M. de Montaigu, had all these superbly masked by fir
wainscoting, for no other reason than because at Paris apartments
were thus fitted up. It was for a similar reason that he only, of all the
ambassadors who were at Venice, took from his pages their swords,
and from his footmen their canes. Such was the man, who, perhaps

from the same motive took a dislike to me on account of my serving
him faithfully.
I patiently endured his disdain, his brutality, and ill-treatment, as
long as, perceiving them accompanied by ill-humor, I thought they
had in them no portion of hatred; but the moment I saw the design
formed of depriving me of the honor I merited by my faithful services,
I resolved to resign my employment. The first mark I received of his
ill will was relative to a dinner he was to give to the Duke of Modena
and his family, who were at Venice, and at which he signified to me I
should not be present. I answered, piqued, but not angry, that having
the honor daily to dine at his table, if the Duke of Modena, when he
came, required I should not appear at it, my duty as well as the
dignity of his excellency would not suffer me to consent to such a
request. "How;" said he passionately, "my secretary, who is not a
gentleman, pretends to dine with a sovereign when my gentlemen do
not!" "Yes, sir," replied I, "the post with which your excellency has
honored me, as long as I discharge the functions of it, so far
ennobles me that my rank is superior to that of your gentlemen or of
the persons calling themselves such; and I am admitted where they
cannot appear. You cannot but know that on the day on which you
shall make your public entry, I am called to the ceremony by
etiquette; and by an immemorial custom, to follow you in a dress of
ceremony, and afterwards to dine with you at the palace of St. Mark;
and I know not why a man who has a right and is to eat in public with
the doge and the senate of Venice should not eat in private with the
Duke of Modena." Though this argument was unanswerable, it did
not convince the ambassador; but we had no occasion to renew the
dispute, as the Duke of Modena did not come to dine with him.
From that moment he did everything in his power to make things
disagreeable to me; and endeavored unjustly to deprive me of my
rights, by taking from me the pecuniary advantages annexed to my
employment, to give them to his dear Vitali; and I am convinced that
had he dared to send him to the senate, in my place, he would have
done it. He commonly employed the Abbe Binis in his closet, to write
his private letters: he made use of him to write to M. de Maurepas an
account of the affair of Captain Olivet, in which, far from taking the
least notice of me, the only person who gave himself any concern

about the matter, he deprived me of the honor of the depositions, of
which he sent him a duplicate, for the purpose of attributing them to
Patizel, who had not opened his mouth. He wished to mortify me,
and please his favorite; but had no desire to dismiss me his service.
He perceived it would be more difficult to find me a successor, than
M. Follau, who had already made him known to the world. An Italian
secretary was absolutely necessary to him, on account of the
answers from the senate; one who could write all his despatches,
and conduct his affairs, without his giving himself the least trouble
about anything; a person who, to the merit of serving him well, could
join the baseness of being the toad-eater of his gentlemen, without
honor, merit, or principles. He wished to retain, and humble me, by
keeping me far from my country, and his own, without money to
return to either, and in which he would, perhaps, had succeeded,
had he began with more moderation: but Vitali, who had other views,
and wished to force me to extremities, carried his point. The moment
I perceived, I lost all my trouble, that the ambassador imputed to me
my services as so many crimes, instead of being satisfied with them;
that with him I had nothing to expect, but things disagreeable at
home, and injustice abroad; and that, in the general disesteem into
which he was fallen, his ill offices might be prejudicial to me, without
the possibility of my being served by his good ones; I took my
resolution, and asked him for my dismission, leaving him sufficient
time to provide himself with another secretary. Without answering
yes or no, he continued to treat me in the same manner, as if nothing
had been said. Perceiving things to remain in the same state, and
that he took no measures to procure himself a new secretary, I wrote
to his brother, and, explaining to him my motives, begged he would
obtain my dismission from his excellency, adding that whether I
received it or not, I could not possibly remain with him. I waited a
long time without any answer, and began to be embarrassed: but at
length the ambassador received a letter from his brother, which must
have remonstrated with him in very plain terms; for although he was
extremely subject to ferocious rage, I never saw him so violent as on
this occasion. After torrents of unsufferable reproaches, not knowing
what more to say, he accused me of having sold his ciphers. I burst
into a loud laughter, and asked him, in a sneering manner, if he

thought there was in Venice a man who would be fool enough to give
half a crown for them all. He threatened to call his servants to throw
me out of the window. Until then I had been very composed; but on
this threat, anger and indignation seized me in my turn. I sprang to
the door, and after having turned a button which fastened it within:
"No, count," said I, returning to him with a grave step, "Your servants
shall have nothing to do with this affair; please to let it be settled
between ourselves." My action and manner instantly made him calm;
fear and surprise were marked in his countenance. The moment I
saw his fury abated, I bid him adieu in a very few words, and without
waiting for his answer, went to the door, opened it, and passed
slowly across the antechamber, through the midst of his people, who
rose according to custom, and who, I am of opinion, would rather
have lent their assistance against him than me. Without going back
to my apartment, I descended the stairs, and immediately went out
of the palace never more to enter it.
I hastened immediately to M. le Blond and related to him what had
happened. Knowing the man, he was but little surprised. He kept me
to dinner. This dinner, although without preparation, was splendid. All
the French of consequence who were at Venice, partook of it. The
ambassador had not a single person. The consul related my case to
the company. The cry was general, and by no means in favor of his
excellency. He had not settled my account, nor paid me a farthing,
and being reduced to the few louis I had in my pocket, I was
extremely embarrassed about my return to France. Every purse was
opened to me. I took twenty sequins from that of M. le Blond, and as
many from that of M. St. Cyr, with whom, next to M. le Blond, I was
the most intimately connected. I returned thanks to the rest; and, till
my departure, went to lodge at the house of the chancellor of the
consulship, to prove to the public, the nation was not an accomplice
in the injustice of the ambassador.
His excellency, furious at seeing me taken notice of in my
misfortune, at the same time that, notwithstanding his being an
ambassador, nobody went near his house, quite lost his senses and
behaved like a madman. He forgot himself so far as to present a
memoir to the senate to get me arrested. On being informed of this
by the Abbe de Binis, I resolved to remain a fortnight longer, instead

of setting off the next day as I had intended. My conduct had been
known and approved of by everybody; I was universally esteemed.
The senate did not deign to return an answer to the extravagant
memoir of the ambassador, but sent me word I might remain in
Venice as long as I thought proper, without making myself uneasy
about the attempts of a madman. I continued to see my friends: I
went to take leave of the ambassador from Spain, who received me
well, and of the Comte de Finochietti, minister from Naples, whom I
did not find at home. I wrote him a letter and received from his
excellency the most polite and obliging answer. At length I took my
departure, leaving behind me, notwithstanding my embarrassment,
no other debts than the two sums I had borrowed, and of which I
have just spoken; and an account of fifty crowns with a shopkeeper,
of the name of Morandi, which Carrio promised to pay, and which I
have never reimbursed him, although we have frequently met since
that time; but with respect to the two sums of money, I returned them
very exactly the moment I had it in my power.
I cannot take leave of Venice without saying something of the
celebrated amusements of that city, or at least of the little part of
them of which I partook during my residence there. It has been seen
how little in my youth I ran after the pleasures of that age, or those
that are so called. My inclinations did not change at Venice, but my
occupations, which moreover would have prevented this, rendered
more agreeable to me the simple recreations I permitted myself. The
first and most pleasing of all was the society of men of merit. M. le
Blond, de St. Cyr, Carrio Altuna, and a Forlinian gentleman, whose
name I am very sorry to have forgotten, and whom I never call to my
recollection without emotion: he was the man of all I ever knew
whose heart most resembled my own. We were connected with two
or three Englishmen of great wit and information, and, like ourselves,
passionately fond of music. All these gentlemen had their wives,
female friends, or mistresses: the latter were most of them women of
talents, at whose apartments there were balls and concerts. There
was but little play; a lively turn, talents, and the theatres rendered
this amusement incipid. Play is the resource of none but men whose
time hangs heavy on their hands. I had brought with me from Paris
the prejudice of that city against Italian music; but I had also received

from nature a sensibility and niceness of distinction which prejudice
cannot withstand. I soon contracted that passion for Italian music
with which it inspires all those who are capable of feeling its
excellence. In listening to barcaroles, I found I had not yet known
what singing was, and I soon became so fond of the opera that, tired
of babbling, eating, and playing in the boxes when I wished to listen,
I frequently withdrew from the company to another part of the
theater. There, quite alone, shut up in my box, I abandoned myself,
notwithstanding the length of the representation, to the pleasure of
enjoying it at ease unto the conclusion. One evening at the theatre of
Saint Chrysostom, I fell into a more profound sleep than I should
have done in my bed. The loud and brilliant airs did not disturb my
repose. But who can explain the delicious sensations given me by
the soft harmony of the angelic music, by which I was charmed from
sleep; what an awaking! what ravishment! what ecstasy, when at the
same instant I opened my ears and eyes! My first idea was to
believe I was in paradise. The ravishing air, which I still recollect and
shall never forget, began with these words:
Conservami la bella,
Che si m'accende il cor.
I was desirous of having it; I had and kept it for a time; but it was
not the same thing upon paper as in my head. The notes were the
same but the thing was different. This divine composition can never
be executed but in my mind, in the same manner as it was the
evening on which it woke me from sleep.
A kind of music far superior, in my opinion, to that of operas, and
which in all Italy has not its equal, nor perhaps in the whole world, is
that of the 'scuole'. The 'scuole' are houses of charity, established for
the education of young girls without fortune, to whom the republic
afterwards gives a portion either in marriage or for the cloister.
Amongst talents cultivated in these young girls, music is in the first
rank. Every Sunday at the church of each of the four 'scuole', during
vespers, motettos or anthems with full choruses, accompanied by a
great orchestra, and composed and directed by the best masters in
Italy, are sung in the galleries by girls only; not one of whom is more

than twenty years of age. I have not an idea of anything so
voluptuous and affecting as this music; the richness of the art, the
exquisite taste of the vocal part, the excellence of the voices, the
justness of the execution, everything in these delightful concerts
concurs to produce an impression which certainly is not the mode,
but from which I am of opinion no heart is secure. Carrio and I never
failed being present at these vespers of the 'Mendicanti', and we
were not alone. The church was always full of the lovers of the art,
and even the actors of the opera came there to form their tastes after
these excellent models. What vexed me was the iron grate, which
suffered nothing to escape but sounds, and concealed from me the
angels of which they were worthy. I talked of nothing else. One day I
spoke of it at Le Blond's; "If you are so desirous," said he, "to see
those little girls, it will be an easy matter to satisfy your wishes. I am
one of the administrators of the house, I will give you a collation with
them." I did not let him rest until he had fulfilled his promise. In
entering the saloon, which contained these beauties I so much
sighed to see, I felt a trembling of love which I had never before
experienced. M. le Blond presented to me one after the other, these
celebrated female singers, of whom the names and voices were all
with which I was acquainted. Come, Sophia,--she was horrid. Come,
Cattina,--she had but one eye. Come, Bettina,--the small-pox had
entirely disfigured her. Scarcely one of them was without some
striking defect.
Le Blond laughed at my surprise; however, two or three of them
appeared tolerable; these never sung but in the choruses; I was
almost in despair. During the collation we endeavored to excite them,
and they soon became enlivened; ugliness does not exclude the
graces, and I found they possessed them. I said to myself, they
cannot sing in this manner without intelligence and sensibility, they
must have both; in fine, my manner of seeing them changed to such
a degree that I left the house almost in love with each of these ugly
faces. I had scarcely courage enough to return to vespers. But after
having seen the girls, the danger was lessened. I still found their
singing delightful; and their voices so much embellished their
persons that, in spite of my eyes, I obstinately continued to think
them beautiful.

Music in Italy is accompanied with so trifling an expense, that it is
not worth while for such as have a taste for it to deny themselves the
pleasure it affords. I hired a harpsichord, and, for half a crown, I had
at my apartment four or five symphonists, with whom I practised
once a week in executing such airs, etc., as had given me most
pleasure at the opera. I also had some symphonies performed from
my 'Muses Galantes'. Whether these pleased the performers, or the
ballet-master of St. John Chrysostom wished to flatter me, he
desired to have two of them; and I had afterwards the pleasure of
hearing these executed by that admirable orchestra. They were
danced to by a little Bettina, pretty and amiable, and kept by a
Spaniard, M. Fagoaga, a friend of ours with whom we often went to
spend the evening. But apropos of girls of easy virtue: it is not in
Venice that a man abstains from them. Have you nothing to confess,
somebody will ask me, upon this subject? Yes: I have something to
say upon it, and I will proceed to the confession with the same
ingenuousness with which I have made my former ones.
I always had a disinclination to girls of pleasure, but at Venice
those were all I had within my reach; most of the houses being shut
against me on account of my place. The daughters of M. le Blond
were very amiable, but difficult of access; and I had too much
respect for the father and mother ever once to have the least desire
for them.
I should have had a much stronger inclination to a young lady
named Mademoiselle de Cataneo, daughter to the agent from the
King of Prussia, but Carrio was in love with her there was even
between them some question of marriage. He was in easy
circumstances, and I had no fortune: his salary was a hundred louis
(guineas) a year, and mine amounted to no more than a thousand
livres (about forty pounds sterling) and, besides my being unwilling
to oppose a friend, I knew that in all places, and especially at Venice,
with a purse so ill furnished as mine was, gallantry was out of the
question. I had not lost the pernicious custom of deceiving my wants.
Too busily employed forcibly to feel those proceeding from the
climate, I lived upwards of a year in that city as chastely as I had
done in Paris, and at the end of eighteen months I quitted it without

having approached the sex, except twice by means of the singular
opportunities of which I am going to speak.
The first was procured me by that honest gentleman, Vitali, some
time after the formal apology I obliged him to make me. The
conversation at the table turned on the amusements of Venice.
These gentlemen reproached me with my indifference with regard to
the most delightful of them all; at the same time extolling the
gracefulness and elegant manners of the women of easy virtue of
Venice; and adding that they were superior to all others of the same
description in any other part of the world. "Dominic," said I, "(I) must
make an acquaintance with the most amiable of them all," he offered
to take me to her apartments, and assured me I should be pleased
with her. I laughed at this obliging offer: and Count Piati, a man in
years and venerable, observed to me, with more candor than I
should have expected from an Italian, that he thought me too
prudent to suffer myself to be taken to such a place by my enemy. In
fact I had no inclination to do it: but notwithstanding this, by an
incoherence I cannot myself comprehend, I at length was prevailed
upon to go, contrary to my inclination, the sentiment of my heart, my
reason, and even my will; solely from weakness, and being ashamed
to show an appearance to the least mistrust; and besides, as the
expression of the country is, 'per non parer troppo cogliono'--[Not to
appear too great a blockhead.]--The 'Padoana' whom we went to
visit was pretty, she was even handsome, but her beauty was not of
that kind that pleased me. Dominic left me with her, I sent for
Sorbetti, and asked her to sing. In about half an hour I wished to take
my leave, after having put a ducat on the table, but this by a singular
scruple she refused until she had deserved it, and I from as singular
a folly consented to remove her doubts. I returned to the palace so
fully persuaded that I should feel the consequences of this step, that
the first thing I did was to send for the king's surgeon to ask him for
ptisans. Nothing can equal the uneasiness of mind I suffered for
three weeks, without its being justified by any real inconvenience or
apparent sign. I could not believe it was possible to withdraw with
impunity from the arms of the 'padoana'. The surgeon himself had
the greatest difficulty in removing my apprehensions; nor could he do
this by any other means than by persuading me I was formed in such

a manner as not to be easily infected: and although in the
experiment I exposed myself less than any other man would have
done, my health in that respect never having suffered the least
inconvenience, in my opinion a proof the surgeon was right.
However, this has never made me imprudent, and if in fact I have
received such an advantage from nature I can safely assert I have
never abused it.
My second adventure, although likewise with a common girl, was
of a nature very different, as well in its origin as in its effects; I have
already said that Captain Olivet gave me a dinner on board his
vessel, and that I took with me the secretary of the Spanish
embassy. I expected a salute of cannon.
The ship's company was drawn up to receive us, but not so much
as a priming was burnt, at which I was mortified, on account of
Carrio, whom I perceived to be rather piqued at the neglect. A salute
of cannon was given on board merchant-ships to people of less
consequence than we were; I besides thought I deserved some
distinguished mark of respect from the captain. I could not conceal
my thoughts, because this at all times was impossible to me, and
although the dinner was a very good one, and Olivet did the honors
of it perfectly well, I began it in an ill humor, eating but little, and
speaking still less. At the first health, at least, I expected a volley;
nothing. Carrio, who read what passed within, me, laughed at
hearing me grumble like a child. Before dinner was half over I saw a
gondola approach the vessel. "Bless me, sir," said the captain, "take
care of yourself, the enemy approaches." I asked him what he
meant, and he answered jocosely. The gondola made the ship's
side, and I observed a gay young damsel come on board very lightly,
and coquettishly dressed, and who at three steps was in the cabin,
seated by my side, before I had time to perceive a cover was laid for
her. She was equally charming and lively, a brunette, not more than
twenty years of age. She spoke nothing but Italian, and her accent
alone was sufficient to turn my head. As she eat and chattered she
cast her eyes upon me; steadfastly looked at me for a moment, and
then exclaimed, "Good Virgin! Ah, my dear Bremond, what an age it
is since I saw thee!" Then she threw herself into my arms, sealed her
lips to mine, and pressed me almost to strangling. Her large black

eyes, like those of the beauties of the East, darted fiery shafts into
my heart, and although the surprise at first stupefied my senses,
voluptuousness made a rapid progress within, and this to such a
degree that the beautiful seducer herself was, notwithstanding the
spectators, obliged to restrain my ardor, for I was intoxicated, or
rather become furious. When she perceived she had made the
impression she desired, she became more moderate in her
caresses, but not in her vivacity, and when she thought proper to
explain to us the real or false cause of all her petulance, she said I
resembled M. de Bremond, director of the customs of Tuscany, to
such a degree as to be mistaken for him; that she had turned this M.
de Bremond's head, and would do it again; that she had quitted him
because he was a fool; that she took me in his place; that she would
love me because it pleased her so to do, for which reason I must
love her as long as it was agreeable to her, and when she thought
proper to send me about my business, I must be patient as her dear
Bremond had been. What was said was done. She took possession
of me as of a man that belonged to her, gave me her gloves to keep,
her fan, her cinda, and her coif, and ordered me to go here or there,
to do this or that, and I instantly obeyed her. She told me to go and
send away her gondola, because she chose to make use of mine,
and I immediately sent it away; she bid me to move from my place,
and pray Carrio to sit down in it, because she had something to say
to him; and I did as she desired. They chatted a good while together,
but spoke low, and I did not interrupt them. She called me, and I
approached her. "Hark thee, Zanetto," said she to me, "I will not be
loved in the French manner; this indeed will not be well. In the first
moment of lassitude, get thee gone: but stay not by the way, I
caution thee." After dinner we went to see the glass manufactory at
Murano. She bought a great number of little curiosities; for which she
left me to pay without the least ceremony. But she everywhere gave
away little trinkets to a much greater amount than of the things we
had purchased. By the indifference with which she threw away her
money, I perceived she annexed to it but little value. When she
insisted upon a payment, I am of opinion it was more from a motive
of vanity than avarice. She was flattered by the price her admirers
set upon her favors.

In the evening we conducted her to her apartments. As we
conversed together, I perceived a couple of pistols upon her toilette.
"Ah! Ah!" said I, taking one of them up, "this is a patchbox of a new
construction: may I ask what is its use? I know you have other arms
which give more fire than those upon your table." After a few
pleasantries of the same kind, she said to us, with an ingenuousness
which rendered her still more charming, "When I am complaisant to
persons whom I do not love, I make them pay for the weariness they
cause me; nothing can be more just; but if I suffer their caresses, I
will not bear their insults; nor miss the first who shall be wanting to
me in respect."
At taking leave of her, I made another appointment for the next
day. I did not make her wait. I found her in 'vestito di conidenza', in
an undress more than wanton, unknown to northern countries, and
which I will not amuse myself in describing, although I recollect it
perfectly well. I shall only remark that her ruffles and collar were
edged with silk network ornamented with rose--colored pompons.
This, in my eyes, much enlivened a beautiful complexion. I
afterwards found it to be the mode at Venice, and the effect is so
charming that I am surprised it has never been introduced in France.
I had no idea of the transports which awaited me. I have spoken of
Madam de Larnage with the transport which the remembrance of her
still sometimes gives me; but how old, ugly and cold she appeared,
compared with my Zulietta! Do not attempt to form to yourself an
idea of the charms and graces of this enchanting girl, you will be far
too short of truth. Young virgins in cloisters are not so fresh: the
beauties of the seraglio are less animated: the houris of paradise
less engaging. Never was so sweet an enjoyment offered to the
heart and senses of a mortal. Ah! had I at least been capable of fully
tasting of it for a single moment! I had tasted of it, but without a
charm. I enfeebled all its delights: I destroyed them as at will. No;
Nature has not made me capable of enjoyment. She has infused into
my wretched head the poison of that ineffable happiness, the desire
of which she first placed in my heart.
If there be a circumstance in my life, which describes my nature, it
is that which I am going to relate. The forcible manner in which I at
this moment recollect the object of my book, will here make me hold

in contempt the false delicacy which would prevent me from fulfilling
it. Whoever you may be who are desirous of knowing a man, have
the courage to read the two or three following pages, and you will
become fully acquainted with J. J. Rousseau.
I entered the chamber of a woman of easy virtue, as the sanctuary
of love and beauty: and in her person, I thought I saw the divinity. I
should have been inclined to think that without respect and esteem it
was impossible to feel anything like that which she made me
experience. Scarcely had I, in her first familiarities, discovered the
force of her charms and caresses, before I wished, for fear of losing
the fruit of them, to gather it beforehand. Suddenly, instead of the
flame which consumed me, I felt a mortal cold run through all my
veins; my legs failed me; and ready to faint away, I sat down and
wept like a child.
Who would guess the cause of my tears, and what, at this
moment, passed within me? I said to myself: the object in my power
is the masterpiece of love; her wit and person equally approach
perfection; she is as good and generous as she is amiable and
beautiful. Yet she is a miserable prostitute, abandoned to the public.
The captain of a merchantship disposed of her at will; she has
thrown herself into my arms, although she knows I have nothing; and
my merit with which she cannot be acquainted, can be to her no
inducement. In this there is something inconceivable. Either my heart
deceives me, fascinates my senses, and makes me the dupe of an
unworthy slut, or some secret defect, of which I am ignorant,
destroys the effect of her charms, and renders her odious in the eyes
of those by whom her charms would otherwise be disputed. I
endeavored, by an extraordinary effort of mind, to discover this
defect, but it did not so much as strike me that even the
consequences to be apprehended, might possibly have some
influence. The clearness of her skin, the brilliancy of her complexion,
her white teeth, sweet breath, and the appearance of neatness about
her person, so far removed from me this idea, that, still in doubt
relative to my situation after the affair of the 'padoana', I rather
apprehended I was not sufficiently in health for her: and I am firmly
persuaded I was not deceived in my opinion. These reflections, so
apropos, agitated me to such a degree as to make me shed tears.

Zuliette, to whom the scene was quite novel, was struck speechless
for a moment. But having made a turn in her chamber, and passing
before her glass, she comprehended, and my eyes confirmed her
opinion, that disgust had no part in what had happened. It was not
difficult for her to recover me and dispel this shamefacedness.
But, at the moment in which I was ready to faint upon a bosom,
which for the first time seemed to suffer the impression of the hand
and lips of a man, I perceived she had a withered 'teton'. I struck my
forehead: I examined, and thought I perceived this teton was not
formed like the other. I immediately began to consider how it was
possible to have such a defect, and persuaded of its proceeding
from some great natural vice, I was clearly convinced, that, instead
of the most charming person of whom I could form to myself an idea,
I had in my arms a species of a monster, the refuse of nature, of men
and of love. I carried my stupidity so far as to speak to her of the
discovery I had made. She, at first, took what I said jocosely; and in
her frolicsome humor, did and said things which made me die of
love. But perceiving an inquietude I could not conceal, she at length
reddened, adjusted her dress, raised herself up, and without saying
a word, went and placed herself at a window. I attempted to place
myself by her side: she withdrew to a sofa, rose from it the next
moment, and fanning herself as she walked about the chamber, said
to me in a reserved and disdainful tone of voice, "Zanetto, 'lascia le
donne, a studia la matematica."--[Leave women and study
mathematics.]
Before I took leave I requested her to appoint another rendezvous
for the next day, which she postponed for three days, adding, with a
satirical smile, that I must needs be in want of repose. I was very ill
at ease during the interval; my heart was full of her charms and
graces; I felt my extravagance, and reproached myself with it,
regretting the loss of the moments I had so ill employed, and which,
had I chosen, I might have rendered more agreeable than any in my
whole life; waiting with the most burning impatience for the moment
in which I might repair the loss, and yet, notwithstanding all my
reasoning upon what I had discovered, anxious to reconcile the
perfections of this adorable girl with the indignity of her situation. I
ran, I flew to her apartment at the hour appointed. I know not

whether or not her ardor would have been more satisfied with this
visit, her pride at least would have been flattered by it, and I already
rejoiced at the idea of my convincing her, in every respect, that I
knew how to repair the wrongs I had done. She spared me this
justification. The gondolier whom I had sent to her apartment brought
me for answer that she had set off, the evening before, for Florence.
If I had not felt all the love I had for her person when this was in my
possession, I felt it in the most cruel manner on losing her. Amiable
and charming as she was in my eyes, I could not console myself for
the loss of her; but this I have never been able to do relative to the
contemptuous idea which at her departure she must have had of me.
These are my two narratives. The eighteen months I passed at
Venice furnished me with no other of the same kind, except a simple
prospect at most. Carrio was a gallant. Tired of visiting girls engaged
to others, he took a fancy to have one to himself, and, as we were
inseparable, he proposed to mean arrangement common enough at
Venice, which was to keep one girl for us both. To this I consented.
The question was, to find one who was safe. He was so industrious
in his researches that he found out a little girl from eleven to twelve
years of age, whom her infamous mother was endeavoring to sell,
and I went with Carrio to see her. The sight of the child moved me to
the most lively compassion. She was fair and as gentle as a lamb.
Nobody would have taken her for an Italian. Living is very cheap in
Venice; we gave a little money to the mother, and provided for the
subsistence of her daughter. She had a voice, and to procure her
some resource we gave her a spinnet, and a singing--master. All
these expenses did not cost each of us more than two sequins a
month, and we contrived to save a much greater sum in other
matters; but as we were obliged to wait until she became of a riper
age, this was sowing a long time before we could possibly reap.
However, satisfied with passing our evenings, chatting and
innocently playing with the child, we perhaps enjoyed greater
pleasure than if we had received the last favors. So true is it that
men are more attached to women by a certain pleasure they have in
living with them, than by any kind of libertinism. My heart became
insensibly attached to the little Anzoletta, but my attachment was
paternal, in which the senses had so little share, that in proportion as

the former increased, to have connected it with the latter would have
been less possible; and I felt I should have experienced, at
approaching this little creature when become nubile, the same horror
with which the abominable crime of incest would have inspired me. I
perceived the sentiments of Carrio take, unobserved by himself,
exactly the same turn. We thus prepared for ourselves, without
intending it, pleasure not less delicious, but very different from that of
which we first had an idea; and I am fully persuaded that however
beautiful the poor child might have become, far from being the
corrupters of her innocence we should have been the protectors of it.
The circumstance which shortly afterwards befell me deprived me, of
the happiness of taking a part in this good work, and my only merit in
the affair was the inclination of my heart.
I will now return to my journey.
My first intentions after leaving M. de Montaigu, was to retire to
Geneva, until time and more favorable circumstances should have
removed the obstacles which prevented my union with my poor
mamma; but the quarrel between me and M. de Montaigu being
become public, and he having had the folly to write about it to the
court, I resolved to go there to give an account of my conduct and
complain of that of a madman. I communicated my intention, from
Venice, to M. du Theil, charged per interim with foreign affairs after
the death of M. Amelot. I set off as soon as my letter, and took my
route through Bergamo, Como, and Domo D'Oscela, and crossing
Saint Plomb. At Sion, M. de Chaignon, charge des affaires from
France, showed me great civility; at Geneva M. de la Closure treated
me with the same polite attention. I there renewed my acquaintance
with M. de Gauffecourt, from whom I had some money to receive. I
had passed through Nion without going to see my father: not that this
was a matter of indifference to me, but because I was unwilling to
appear before my mother-in-law, after the disaster which had
befallen me, certain of being condemned by her without being heard.
The bookseller, Du Villard, an old friend of my father's, reproached
me severely with this neglect. I gave him my reasons for it, and to
repair my fault, without exposing myself to meet my mother-in-law, I
took a chaise and we went together to Nion and stopped at a public
house. Du Villard went to fetch my father, who came running to

embrace me. We supped together, and, after passing an evening
very agreeable to the wishes of my heart, I returned the next
morning to Geneva with Du Villard, for whom I have ever since
retained a sentiment of gratitude in return for the service he did me
on this occasion.
Lyons was a little out of my direct road, but I was determined to
pass through that city in order to convince myself of a knavish trick
played me by M. de Montaigu. I had sent me from Paris a little box
containing a waistcoat, embroidered with gold, a few pairs of ruffles,
and six pairs of white silk stockings; nothing more. Upon a
proposition made me by M. de Montaigu, I ordered this box to be
added to his baggage. In the apothecary's bill he offered me in
payment of my salary, and which he wrote out himself, he stated the
weight of this box, which he called a bale, at eleven hundred pounds,
and charged me with the carriage of it at an enormous rate. By the
cares of M. Boy de la Tour, to whom I was recommended by M.
Roquin, his uncle, it was proved from the registers of the customs of
Lyons and Marseilles, that the said bale weighed no more than fortyfive pounds, and had paid carriage according to that weight. I joined
this authentic extract to the memoir of M, de Montaigu, and provided
with these papers and others containing stronger facts, I returned to
Paris, very impatient to make use of them. During the whole of this
long journey I had little adventures; at Como, in Valais, and
elsewhere. I there saw many curious things, amongst others the
Boroma islands, which are worthy of being described. But I am
pressed by time, and surrounded by spies. I am obliged to write in
haste, and very imperfectly, a work which requires the leisure and
tranquility I do not enjoy. If ever providence in its goodness grants
me days more calm, I shall destine them to new modelling this work,
should I be able to do it, or at least to giving a supplement, of which I
perceive it stands in the greatest need.--[I have given up this
project.]
The news of my quarrel had reached Paris before me and on my
arrival I found the people in all the offices, and the public in general,
scandalized at the follies of the ambassador.
Notwithstanding this, the public talk at Venice, and the
unanswerable proof I exhibited, I could not obtain even the shadow

of justice. Far from obtaining satisfaction or reparation, I was left at
the discretion of the ambassador for my salary, and this for no other
reason than because, not being a Frenchman, I had no right to
national protection, and that it was a private affair between him and
myself. Everybody agreed I was insulted, injured, and unfortunate;
that the ambassador was mad, cruel, and iniquitous, and that the
whole of the affair dishonored him forever. But what of this! He was
the ambassador, and I was nothing more than the secretary.
Order, or that which is so called, was in opposition to my obtaining
justice, and of this the least shadow was not granted me. I supposed
that, by loudly complaining, and by publicly treating this madman in
the manner he deserved, I should at length be told to hold my
tongue; this was what I wished for, and I was fully determined not to
obey until I had obtained redress. But at that time there was no
minister for foreign affairs. I was suffered to exclaim, nay, even
encouraged to do it, and joined with; but the affair still remained in
the same state, until, tired of being in the right without obtaining
justice, my courage at length failed me, and let the whole drop.
The only person by whom I was ill received, and from whom I
should have least expected such an injustice, was Madam de
Beuzenval. Full of the prerogatives of rank and nobility, she could not
conceive it was possible an ambassador could ever be in the wrong
with respect to his secretary. The reception she gave me was
conformable to this prejudice. I was so piqued at it that, immediately
after leaving her, I wrote her perhaps one of the strongest and most
violent letters that ever came from my pen, and since that time I
never once returned to her house. I was better received by Father
Castel; but, in the midst of his Jesuitical wheedling I perceived him
faithfully to follow one of the great maxims of his society, which is to
sacrifice the weak to the powerful. The strong conviction I felt of the
justice of my cause, and my natural greatness of mind did not suffer
me patiently to endure this partiality. I ceased visiting Father Castel,
and on that account, going to the college of the Jesuits, where I
knew nobody but himself. Besides the intriguing and tyrannical spirit
of his brethren, so different from the cordiality of the good Father
Hemet, gave me such a disgust for their conversation that I have
never since been acquainted with, nor seen anyone of them except

Father Berthier, whom I saw twice or thrice at M. Dupin's, in
conjunction with whom he labored with all his might at the refutation
of Montesquieu.
That I may not return to the subject, I will conclude what I have to
say of M. de Montaigu. I had told him in our quarrels that a secretary
was not what he wanted, but an attorney's clerk. He took the hint,
and the person whom he procured to succeed me was a real
attorney, who in less than a year robbed him of twenty or thirty
thousand livres. He discharged him, and sent him to prison,
dismissed his gentleman with disgrace, and, in wretchedness, got
himself everywhere into quarrels, received affronts which a footman
would not have put up with, and, after numerous follies, was
recalled, and sent from the capital. It is very probable that among the
reprimands he received at court, his affair with me was not forgotten.
At least, a little time after his return he sent his maitre d' hotel, to
settle my account, and give me some money. I was in want of it at
that moment; my debts at Venice, debts of honor, if ever there were
any, lay heavy upon my mind. I made use of the means which
offered to discharge them, as well as the note of Zanetto Nani. I
received what was offered me, paid all my debts, and remained as
before, without a farthing in my pocket, but relieved from a weight
which had become insupportable. From that time I never heard
speak of M. de Montaigu until his death, with which I became
acquainted by means of the Gazette. The peace of God be with that
poor man! He was as fit for the functions of an ambassador as in my
infancy I had been for those of Grapignan.--[I have not been able to
find this word in any dictionary, nor does any Frenchman of letters of
my acquaintance know what it means. --T.]--However, it was in his
power to have honorably supported himself by my services, and
rapidly to have advanced me in a career to which the Comte de
Gauvon had destined me in my youth, and of the functions of which I
had in a more advanced age rendered myself capable.
The justice and inutility of my complaints, left in my mind seeds of
indignation against our foolish civil institutions, by which the welfare
of the public and real justice are always sacrificed to I know not what
appearance of order, and which does nothing more than add the
sanction of public authority to the oppression of the weak, and the

iniquity of the powerful. Two things prevented these seeds from
putting forth at that time as they afterwards did: one was, myself
being in question in the affair, and private interest, whence nothing
great or noble ever proceeded, could not draw from my heart the
divine soarings, which the most pure love, only of that which is just
and sublime, can produce. The other was the charm of friendship
which tempered and calmed my wrath by the ascendancy of a more
pleasing sentiment. I had become acquainted at Venice with a
Biscayan, a friend of my friend Carrio's, and worthy of being that of
every honest man. This amiable young man, born with every talent
and virtue, had just made the tour of Italy to gain a taste for the fine
arts, and, imagining he had nothing more to acquire, intended to
return by the most direct road to his own country. I told him the arts
were nothing more than a relaxation to a genius like his, fit to
cultivate the sciences; and to give him a taste for these, I advised
him to make a journey to Paris and reside there for six months. He
took my advice, and went to Paris. He was there and expected me
when I arrived. His lodging was too considerable for him, and he
offered me the half of it, which I instantly accepted. I found him
absorbed in the study of the sublimest sciences. Nothing was above
his reach. He digested everything with a prodigious rapidity. How
cordially did he thank me for having procured him this food for his
mind, which was tormented by a thirst after knowledge, without his
being aware of it! What a treasure of light and virtue I found in the
vigorous mind of this young man! I felt he was the friend I wanted.
We soon became intimate. Our tastes were not the same, and we
constantly disputed. Both opinionated, we never could agree about
anything. Nevertheless we could not separate; and, notwithstanding
our reciprocal and incessant contradiction, we neither of us wished
the other to be different from what he was.
Ignacio Emanuel de Altuna was one of those rare beings whom
only Spain produces, and of whom she produces too few for her
glory. He had not the violent national passions common in his own
country. The idea of vengeance could no more enter his head, than
the desire of it could proceed from his heart. His mind was too great
to be vindictive, and I have frequently heard him say, with the
greatest coolness, that no mortal could offend him. He was gallant,

without being tender. He played with women as with so many pretty
children. He amused himself with the mistresses of his friends, but I
never knew him to have one of his own, nor the least desire for it.
The emanations from the virtue with which his heart was stored,
never permitted the fire of the passions to excite sensual desires.
After his travels he married, died young, and left children; and, I
am as convinced as of my existence, that his wife was the first and
only woman with whom he ever tasted of the pleasures of love.
Externally he was devout, like a Spaniard, but in his heart he had
the piety of an angel. Except myself, he is the only man I ever saw
whose principles were not intolerant. He never in his life asked any
person his opinion in matters of religion. It was not of the least
consequence to him whether his friend was a Jew, a Protestant, a
Turk, a Bigot, or an Atheist, provided he was an honest man.
Obstinate and headstrong in matters of indifference, but the moment
religion was in question, even the moral part, he collected himself,
was silent, or simply said: "I am charged with the care of myself,
only." It is astonishing so much elevation of mind should be
compatible with a spirit of detail carried to minuteness. He previously
divided the employment of the day by hours, quarters and minutes;
and so scrupulously adhered to this distribution, that had the clock
struck while he was reading a phrase, he would have shut his book
without finishing it. His portions of time thus laid out, were some of
them set apart to studies of one kind, and others to those of another:
he had some for reflection, conversation, divine service, the reading
of Locke, for his rosary, for visits, music and painting; and neither
pleasure, temptation, nor complaisance, could interrupt this order: a
duty he might have had to discharge was the only thing that could
have done it. When he gave me a list of his distribution, that I might
conform myself thereto, I first laughed, and then shed tears of
admiration. He never constrained anybody nor suffered constraint:
he was rather rough with people, who from politeness, attempted to
put it upon him. He was passionate without being sullen. I have often
seen him warm, but never saw him really angry with any person.
Nothing could be more cheerful than his temper: he knew how to
pass and receive a joke; raillery was one of his distinguished talents,
and with which he possessed that of pointed wit and repartee. When

he was animated, he was noisy and heard at a great distance; but
whilst he loudly inveighed, a smile was spread over his countenance,
and in the midst of his warmth he used some diverting expression
which made all his hearers break out into a loud laugh. He had no
more of the Spanish complexion than of the phlegm of that country.
His skin was white, his cheeks finely colored, and his hair of a light
chestnut. He was tall and well made; his body was well formed for
the residence of his mind.
This wise--hearted as well as wise--headed man, knew mankind,
and was my friend; this was my only answer to such as are not so.
We were so intimately united, that our intention was to pass our days
together. In a few years I was to go to Ascoytia to live with him at his
estate; every part of the project was arranged the eve of his
departure; nothing was left undetermined, except that which
depends not upon men in the best concerted plans, posterior events.
My disasters, his marriage, and finally, his death, separated us
forever. Some men would be tempted to say, that nothing succeeds
except the dark conspiracies of the wicked, and that the innocent
intentions of the good are seldom or never accomplished. I had felt
the inconvenience of dependence, and took a resolution never again
to expose myself to it; having seen the projects of ambition, which
circumstances had induced me to form, overturned in their birth.
Discouraged in the career I had so well begun, from which, however,
I had just been expelled, I resolved never more to attach myself to
any person, but to remain in an independent state, turning my talents
to the best advantage: of these I at length began to feel the extent,
and that I had hitherto had too modest an opinion of them. I again
took up my opera, which I had laid aside to go to Venice; and that I
might be less interrupted after the departure of Altuna, I returned to
my old hotel St. Quentin; which, in a solitary part of the town, and not
far from the Luxembourg, was more proper for my purpose than
noisy Rue St. Honor.
There the only consolation which Heaven suffered me to taste in
my misery, and the only one which rendered it supportable, awaited
me. This was not a trancient acquaintance; I must enter into some
detail relative to the manner in which it was made.

We had a new landlady from Orleans; she took for a
needlewoman a girl from her own country, of between twenty--two
and twenty--three years of age, and who, as well as the hostess, ate
at our table. This girl, named Theresa le Vasseur, was of a good
family; her father was an officer in the mint of Orleans, and her
mother a shopkeeper; they had many children. The function of the
mint of Orleans being suppressed, the father found himself without
employment; and the mother having suffered losses, was reduced to
narrow circumstances. She quitted her business and came to Paris
with her husband and daughter, who, by her industry, maintained all
the three.
The first time I saw this girl at table, I was struck with her modesty;
and still more so with her lively yet charming look, which, with
respect to the impression it made upon me, was never equalled.
Beside M. de Bonnefond, the company was composed of several
Irish priests, Gascons and others of much the same description. Our
hostess herself had not made the best possible use of her time, and
I was the only person at the table who spoke and behaved with
decency. Allurements were thrown out to the young girl. I took her
part, and the joke was then turned against me. Had I had no natural
inclination to the poor girl, compassion and contradiction would have
produced it in me: I was always a great friend to decency in manners
and conversation, especially in the fair sex. I openly declared myself
her champion, and perceived she was not insensible of my attention;
her looks, animated by the gratitude she dared not express by
words, were for this reason still more penetrating.
She was very timid, and I was as much so as herself. The
connection which this disposition common to both seemed to remove
to a distance, was however rapidly formed. Our landlady perceiving
its progress, became furious, and her brutality forwarded my affair
with the young girl, who, having no person in the house except
myself to give her the least support, was sorry to see me go from
home, and sighed for the return of her protector. The affinity our
hearts bore to each other, and the similarity of our dispositions, had
soon their ordinary effect. She thought she saw in me an honest
man, and in this she was not deceived. I thought I perceived in her a
woman of great sensibility, simple in her manners, and devoid of all

coquetry:--I was no more deceived in her than she in me. I began by
declaring to her that I would never either abandon or marry her.
Love, esteem, artless sincerity were the ministers of my triumph, and
it was because her heart was tender and virtuous, that I was happy
without being presuming.
The apprehensions she was under of my not finding in her that for
which I sought, retarded my happiness more than every other
circumstance. I perceived her disconcerted and confused before she
yielded her consent, wishing to be understood and not daring to
explain herself. Far from suspecting the real cause of her
embarrassment, I falsely imagined it to proceed from another motive,
a supposition highly insulting to her morals, and thinking she gave
me to understand my health might be exposed to danger, I fell into
so perplexed a state that, although it was no restraint upon me, it
poisoned my happiness during several days. As we did not
understand each other, our conversations upon this subject were so
many enigmas more than ridiculous. She was upon the point of
believing I was absolutely mad; and I on my part was as near not
knowing what else to think of her. At last we came to an explanation;
she confessed to me with tears the only fault of the kind of her whole
life, immediately after she became nubile; the fruit of her ignorance
and the address of her seducer. The moment I comprehended what
she meant, I gave a shout of joy. "A Hymen!" exclaimed I; "sought for
at Paris, and at twenty years of age! Ah my Theresa! I am happy in
possessing thee, virtuous and healthy as thou art, and in not finding
that for which I never sought."
At first amusement was my only object; I perceived I had gone
further and had given myself a companion. A little intimate
connection with this excellent girl, and a few reflections upon my
situation, made me discover that, while thinking of nothing more than
my pleasures, I had done a great deal towards my happiness. In the
place of extinguished ambition, a life of sentiment, which had entire
possession of my heart, was necessary to me. In a word, I wanted a
successor to mamma: since I was never again to live with her, it was
necessary some person should live with her pupil, and a person, too,
in whom I might find that simplicity and docility of mind and heart
which she had found in me. It was, moreover, necessary that the

happiness of domestic life should indemnify me for the splendid
career I had just renounced. When I was quite alone there was a
void in my heart, which wanted nothing more than another heart to
fill it up. Fate had deprived me of this, or at least in part alienated me
from that for which by nature I was formed. From that moment I was
alone, for there never was for me the least thing intermediate
between everything and nothing. I found in Theresa the supplement
of which I stood in need; by means of her I lived as happily as I
possibly could do, according to the course of events.
I at first attempted to improve her mind. In this my pains were
useless. Her mind is as nature formed it: it was not susceptible of
cultivation. I do not blush in acknowledging she never knew how to
read well, although she writes tolerably. When I went to lodge in the
Rue Neuve des Petits Champs, opposite to my windows at the Hotel
de Ponchartrain, there was a sun-dial, on which for a whole month I
used all my efforts to teach her to know the hours; yet, she scarcely
knows them at present. She never could enumerate the twelve
months of the year in order, and cannot distinguish one numeral from
another, notwithstanding all the trouble I took endeavoring to teach
them to her. She neither knows how to count money, nor to reckon
the price of anything. The word which when she speaks, presents
itself to her mind, is frequently opposite to that of which she means
to make use. I formerly made a dictionary of her phrases, to amuse
M. de Luxembourg, and her 'qui pro quos' often became celebrated
among those with whom I was most intimate. But this person, so
confined in her intellects, and, if the world pleases, so stupid, can
give excellent advice in cases of difficulty. In Switzerland, in England
and in France, she frequently saw what I had not myself perceived;
she has often given me the best advice I could possibly follow; she
has rescued me from dangers into which I had blindly precipitated
myself, and in the presence of princes and the great, her sentiments,
good sense, answers, and conduct have acquired her universal
esteem, and myself the most sincere congratulations on her merit.
With persons whom we love, sentiment fortifies the mind as well as
the heart; and they who are thus attached, have little need of
searching for ideas elsewhere.

I lived with my Theresa as agreeably as with the finest genius in
the world. Her mother, proud of having been brought up under the
Marchioness of Monpipeau, attempted to be witty, wished to direct
the judgment of her daughter, and by her knavish cunning destroyed
the simplicity of our intercourse.
The fatigue of this opportunity made me in some degree surmount
the foolish shame which prevented me from appearing with Theresa
in public; and we took short country walks, tete-a-tete, and partook of
little collations, which, to me, were delicious. I perceived she loved
me sincerely, and this increased my tenderness. This charming
intimacy left me nothing to wish; futurity no longer gave me the least
concern, or at most appeared only as the present moment
prolonged: I had no other desire than that of insuring its duration.
This attachment rendered all other dissipation superfluous and
insipid to me. As I only went out for the purpose of going to the
apartment of Theresa, her place of residence almost became my
own. My retirement was so favorable to the work I had undertaken,
that, in less than three months, my opera was entirely finished, both
words and music, except a few accompaniments, and fillings up
which still remained to be added. This maneuvering business was
very fatiguing to me. I proposed it to Philidor, offering him at the
same time a part of the profits. He came twice, and did something to
the middle parts in the act of Ovid; but he could not confine himself
to an assiduous application by the allurement of advantages which
were distant and uncertain. He did not come a third time, and I
finished the work myself.
My opera completed, the next thing was to make something of it:
this was by much the more difficult task of the two. A man living in
solitude in Paris will never succeed in anything. I was on the point of
making my way by means of M. de la Popliniere, to whom
Gauffecourt, at my return to Geneva had introduced me. M. de la
Popliniere was the Mecaenas of Rameau; Madam de la Popliniere
his very humble scholar. Rameau was said to govern in that house.
Judging that he would with pleasure protect the work of one of his
disciples, I wished to show him what I had done. He refused to
examine it; saying he could not read score, it was too fatiguing to
him. M. de la Popliniere, to obviate this difficulty, said he might hear

it; and offered me to send for musicians to execute certain detached
pieces. I wished for nothing better. Rameau consented with an ill
grace, incessantly repeating that the composition of a man not
regularly bred to the science, and who had learned music without a
master, must certainly be very fine! I hastened to copy into parts five
or six select passages. Ten symphonies were procured, and Albert,
Berard, and Mademoiselle Bourbonois undertook the vocal part.
Remeau, the moment he heard the overture, was purposely
extravagant in his eulogium, by which he intended it should be
understood it could not be my composition. He showed signs of
impatience at every passage: but after a counter tenor song, the air
of which was noble and harmonious, with a brilliant accompaniment,
he could no longer contain himself; he apostrophised me with a
brutality at which everybody was shocked, maintaining that a part of
what he had heard was by a man experienced in the art, and the rest
by some ignorant person who did not so much as understand music.
It is true my composition, unequal and without rule, was sometimes
sublime, and at others insipid, as that of a person who forms himself
in an art by the soarings of his own genius, unsupported by science,
must necessarily be. Rameau pretended to see nothing in me but a
contemptible pilferer, without talents or taste. The rest of the
company, among whom I must distinguish the master of the house,
were of a different opinion. M. de Richelieu, who at that time
frequently visited M. and Madam de la Popliniere, heard them speak
of my work, and wished to hear the whole of it, with an intention, if it
pleased him, to have it performed at court. The opera was executed
with full choruses, and by a great orchestra, at the expense of the
king, at M. de Bonneval's intendant of the Menus; Francoeur
directed the band. The effect was surprising: the duke never ceased
to exclaim and applaud; and, at the end of one of the choruses, in
the act of Tasso, he arose and came to me, and, pressing my hand,
said: "M. Rousseau, this is transporting harmony. I never heard
anything finer. I will get this performed at Versailles."
Madam de la Poliniere, who was present, said not a word.
Rameau, although invited, refused to come. The next day, Madam
de la Popliniere received me at her toilette very ungraciously,
affected to undervalue my piece, and told me, that although a little

false glitter had at first dazzled M. de Richelieu, he had recovered
from his error, and she advised me not to place the least
dependence upon my opera. The duke arrived soon after, and spoke
to me in quite a different language. He said very flattering things of
my talents, and seemed as much disposed as ever to have my
composition performed before the king. "There is nothing," said he,
"but the act of Tasso which cannot pass at court: you must write
another." Upon this single word I shut myself up in my apartment;
and in three weeks produced, in the place of Tasso, another act, the
subject of which was Hesiod inspired by the muses. In this I found
the secret of introducing a part of the history of my talents, and of the
jealousy with which Rameau had been pleased to honor me. There
was in the new act an elevation less gigantic and better supported
than in the act of Tasso. The music was as noble and the
composition better; and had the other two acts been equal to this,
the whole piece would have supported a representation to
advantage. But whilst I was endeavoring to give it the last finishing,
another undertaking suspended the completion of that I had in my
hand. In the winter which succeeded the battle of Fontenoi, there
were many galas at Versailles, and several operas performed at the
theater of the little stables. Among the number of the latter was the
dramatic piece of Voltaire, entitled 'La Princesse de Navarre', the
music by Rameau, the name of which has just been changed to that
of 'Fetes de Ramire'. This new subject required several changes to
be made in the divertissements, as well in the poetry as in the music.
A person capable of both was now sought after. Voltaire was in
Lorraine, and Rameau also; both of whom were employed on the
opera of the Temple of Glory, and could not give their attention to
this. M. de Richelieu thought of me, and sent to desire I would
undertake the alterations; and, that I might the better examine what
there was to do, he gave me separately the poem and the music. In
the first place, I would not touch the words without the consent of the
author, to whom I wrote upon the subject a very polite and respectful
letter, such a one as was proper; and received from him the following
answer:
"SIR: In you two talents, which hitherto have always been
separated, are united. These are two good reasons for me to esteem

and to endeavor to love you. I am sorry, on your account, you should
employ these talents in a work which is so little worthy of them. A
few months ago the Duke de Richelieu commanded me to make,
absolutely in the twinkling of an eye, a little and bad sketch of a few
insipid and imperfect scenes to be adapted to divertissements which
are not of a nature to be joined with them. I obeyed with the greatest
exactness. I wrote very fast, and very ill. I sent this wretched
production to M. de Richelieu, imagining he would make no use of it,
or that I should have it again to make the necessary corrections.
Happily it is in your hands, and you are at full liberty to do with it
whatever you please: I have entirely lost sight of the thing. I doubt
not but you will have corrected all the faults which cannot but abound
in so hasty a composition of such a very simple sketch, and am
persuaded you will have supplied whatever was wanting.
"I remember that, among other stupid inattentions, no account is
given in the scenes which connect the divertissements of the manner
in which the Grenadian prince immediately passes from a prison to a
garden or palace. As it is not a magician but a Spanish nobleman
who gives her the gala, I am of opinion nothing should be effected by
enchantment.
"I beg, sir, you will examine this part, of which I have but a
confused idea.
"You will likewise consider, whether or not it be necessary the
prison should be opened, and the princess conveyed from it to a fine
palace, gilt and varnished, and prepared for her. I know all this is
wretched, and that it is beneath a thinking being to make a serious
affair of such trifles; but, since we must displease as little as
possible, it is necessary we should conform to reason, even in a bad
divertissement of an opera.
"I depend wholly upon you and M. Ballot, and soon expect to have
the honor of returning you my thanks, and assuring you how much I
am, etc."
There is nothing surprising in the great politeness of this letter,
compared with the almost crude ones which he has since written to
me. He thought I was in great favor with Madam Richelieu; and the
courtly suppleness, which everyone knows to be the character of this
author, obliged him to be extremely polite to a new comer, until he

become better acquainted with the measure of the favor and
patronage he enjoyed.
Authorized by M. de Voltaire, and not under the necessity of giving
myself the least concern about M. Rameau, who endeavored to
injure me, I set to work, and in two months my undertaking was
finished. With respect to the poetry, it was confined to a mere trifle; I
aimed at nothing more than to prevent the difference of style from
being perceived, and had the vanity to think I had succeeded. The
musical part was longer and more laborious. Besides my having to
compose several preparatory pieces, and, amongst others, the
overture, all the recitative, with which I was charged, was extremely
difficult on account of the necessity there was of connecting, in a few
verses, and by very rapid modulations, symphonies and choruses, in
keys very different from each other; for I was determined neither to
change nor transpose any of the airs, that Rameau might not accuse
me of having disfigured them. I succeeded in the recitative; it was
well accented, full of energy and excellent modulation. The idea of
two men of superior talents, with whom I was associated, had
elevated my genius, and I can assert, that in this barren and
inglorious task, of which the public could have no knowledge, I was
for the most part equal to my models.
The piece, in the state to which I had brought it, was rehearsed in
the great theatre of the opera. Of the three authors who had
contributed to the production, I was the only one present. Voltaire
was not in Paris, and Rameau either did not come, or concealed
himself. The words of the first monologue were very mournful; they
began with:
O Mort! viens terminer les malheurs de ma vie.
[O Death! hasten to terminate the misfortunes of my life.]
To these, suitable music was necessary. It was, however, upon
this that Madam de la Popliniere founded her censure; accusing me,
with much bitterness, of having composed a funeral anthem. M. de
Richelieu very judiciously began by informing himself who was the
author of the poetry of this monologue; I presented him the

manuscript he had sent me, which proved it was by Voltaire. "In that
case," said the duke, "Voltaire alone is to blame." During the
rehearsal, everything I had done was disapproved by Madam de la
Popliniere, and approved of by M. de Richelieu; but I had afterwards
to do with too powerful an adversary. It was signified to me that
several parts of my composition wanted revising, and that on this it
was necessary I should consult M. Rameau; my heart was wounded
by such a conclusion, instead of the eulogium I expected, and which
certainly I merited, and I returned to my apartment overwhelmed with
grief, exhausted with fatigue, and consumed by chagrin. I was
immediately taken ill, and confined to my chamber for upwards of six
weeks.
Rameau, who was charged with the alterations indicated by
Madam de la Popliniere, sent to ask me for the overture of my great
opera, to substitute it to that I had just composed. Happily I
perceived the trick he intended to play me, and refused him the
overture. As the performance was to be in five or six days, he had
not time to make one, and was obliged to leave that I had prepared.
It was in the Italian taste, and in a style at that time quite new in
France. It gave satisfaction, and I learned from M. de Valmalette,
maitre d'hotel to the king, and son-in-law to M. Mussard, my relation
and friend, that the connoisseurs were highly satisfied with my work,
and that the public had not distinguished it from that of Rameau.
However, he and Madam de la Popliniere took measures to prevent
any person from knowing I had any concern in the matter. In the
books distributed to the audience, and in which the authors are
always named, Voltaire was the only person mentioned, and
Rameau preferred the suppression of his own name to seeing it
associated with mine.
As soon as I was in a situation to leave my room, I wished to wait
upon M. de Richelieu, but it was too late; he had just set off for
Dunkirk, where he was to command the expedition destined to
Scotland. At his return, said I to myself, to authorize my idleness, it
will be too late for my purpose, not having seen him since that time. I
lost the honor of mywork and the emoluments it should have
produced me, besides considering my time, trouble, grief, and
vexation, my illness, and the money this cost me, without ever

receiving the least benefit, or rather, recompense. However, I always
thought M. de Richelieu was disposed to serve me, and that he had
a favorable opinion of my talents; but my misfortune, and Madam de
la Popliniere, prevented the effect of his good wishes.
I could not divine the reason of the aversion this lady had to me. I
had always endeavored to make myself agreeable to her, and
regularly paid her my court. Gauffecourt explained to me the causes
of her dislike: "The first," said he, "is her friendship for Rameau, of
whom she is the declared panegyrist, and who will not suffer a
competitor; the next is an original sin, which ruins you in her
estimation, and which she will never forgive; you are a Genevese."
Upon this he told me the Abbe Hubert, who was from the same city,
and the sincere friend of M. de la Popliniere, had used all his efforts
to prevent him from marrying this lady, with whose character and
temper he was very well acquainted; and that after the marriage she
had vowed him an implacable hatred, as well as all the Genevese.
"Although La Popliniere has a friendship for you, do not," said he,
"depend upon his protection: he is still in love with his wife: she
hates you, and is vindictive and artful; you will never do anything in
that house." All this I took for granted.
The same Gauffecourt rendered me much about this time, a
service of which I stood in the greatest need. I had just lost my
virtuous father, who was about sixty years of age. I felt this loss less
severely than I should have done at any other time, when the
embarrassments of my situation had less engaged my attention.
During his life-time I had never claimed what remained of the
property of my mother, and of which he received the little interest.
His death removed all my scruples upon this subject. But the want of
a legal proof of the death of my brother created a difficulty which
Gauffecourt undertook to remove, and this he effected by means of
the good offices of the advocate De Lolme. As I stood in need of the
little resource, and the event being doubtful, I waited for a definitive
account with the greatest anxiety.
One evening on entering my apartment I found a letter, which I
knew to contain the information I wanted, and I took it up with an
impatient trembling, of which I was inwardly ashamed. What? said I
to myself, with disdain, shall Jean Jacques thus suffer himself to be

subdued by interest and curiosity? I immediately laid the letter again
upon the chimney-piece. I undressed myself, went to bed with great
composure, slept better than ordinary, and rose in the morning at a
late hour, without thinking more of my letter. As I dressed myself, it
caught my eye; I broke the seal very leisurely, and found under the
envelope a bill of exchange. I felt a variety of pleasing sensations at
the same time: but I can assert, upon my honor, that the most lively
of them all was that proceeding from having known how to be master
of myself.
I could mention twenty such circumstances in my life, but I am too
much pressed for time to say everything. I sent a small part of this
money to my poor mamma; regretting, with my eyes suffused with
tears, the happy time when I should have laid it all at her feet. All her
letters contained evident marks of her distress. She sent me piles of
recipes, and numerous secrets, with which she pretended I might
make my fortune and her own. The idea of her wretchedness already
affected her heart and contracted her mind. The little I sent her fell a
prey to the knaves by whom she was surrounded; she received not
the least advantage from anything. The idea of dividing what was
necessary to my own subsistence with these wretches disgusted me,
especially after the vain attempt I had made to deliver her from them,
and of which I shall have occasion to speak. Time slipped away, and
with it the little money I had; we were two, or indeed, four persons;
or, to speak still more correctly, seven or eight. Although Theresa
was disinterested to a degree of which there are but few examples,
her mother was not so. She was no sooner a little relieved from her
necessities by my cares, than she sent for her whole family to
partake of the fruits of them. Her sisters, sons, daughters, all except
her eldest daughter, married to the director of the coaches of Augers,
came to Paris. Everything I did for Theresa, her mother diverted from
its original destination in favor of these people who were starving. I
had not to do with an avaricious person; and, not being under the
influence of an unruly passion, I was not guilty of follies. Satisfied
with genteelly supporting Theresa without luxury, and unexposed to
pressing wants, I readily consented to let all the earnings of her
industry go to the profit of her mother; and to this even I did not
confine myself; but, by a fatality by which I was pursued, whilst

mamma was a prey to the rascals about her Theresa was the same
to her family; and I could not do anything on either side for the
benefit of her to whom the succor I gave was destined. It was odd
enough the youngest child of M. de la Vasseur, the only one who had
not received a marriage portion from her parents, should provide for
their subsistence; and that, after having along time been beaten by
her brothers, sisters, and even her nieces, the poor girl should be
plundered by them all, without being more able to defend herself
from their thefts than from their blows. One of her nieces, named
Gorton le Duc, was of a mild and amiable character; although
spoiled by the lessons and examples of the others. As I frequently
saw them together, I gave them names, which they afterwards gave
to each other; I called the niece my niece, and the aunt my aunt;
they both called me uncle. Hence the name of aunt, by which I
continued to call Theresa, and which my friends sometimes jocosely
repeated. It will be judged that in such a situation I had not a moment
to lose, before I attempted to extricate myself. Imagining M. de
Richelieu had forgotten me, and having no more hopes from the
court, I made some attempts to get my opera brought out at Paris;
but I met with difficulties which could not immediately be removed,
and my situation became daily more painful. I presented my little
comedy of Narcisse to the Italians; it was received, and I had the
freedom of the theatre, which gave much pleasure. But this was all; I
could never get my piece performed, and, tired of paying my court to
players, I gave myself no more trouble about them. At length I had
recourse to the last expedient which remained to me, and the only
one of which I ought to have made use. While frequenting the house
of M. de la Popliniere, I had neglected the family of Dupin. The two
ladies, although related, were not on good terms, and never saw
each other. There was not the least intercourse between the two
families, and Thieriot was the only person who visited both. He was
desired to endeavor to bring me again to M. Dupin's. M. de Francueil
was then studying natural history and chemistry, and collecting a
cabinet. I believe he aspired to become a member of the Academy of
Sciences; to this effect he intended to write a book, and judged I
might be of use to him in the undertaking. Madam de Dupin, who, on
her part, had another work in contemplation, had much the same

views in respect to me. They wished to have me in common as a
kind of secretary, and this was the reason of the invitations of
Thieriot.
I required that M. de Francueil should previously employ his
interest with that of Jelyote to get my work rehearsed at the
operahouse; to this he consented. The Muses Galantes were several
times rehearsed, first at the Magazine, and afterwards in the great
theatre. The audience was very numerous at the great rehearsal,
and several parts of the composition were highly applauded.
However, during this rehearsal, very ill-conducted by Rebel, I felt the
piece would not be received; and that, before it could appear, great
alterations were necessary. I therefore withdrew it without saying a
word, or exposing myself to a refusal; but I plainly perceived, by
several indications, that the work, had it been perfect, could not have
succeeded. M. de Francueil had promised me to get it rehearsed,
but not that it should be received. He exactly kept his word. I thought
I perceived on this occasion, as well as many others, that neither
Madam Dupin nor himself were willing I should acquire a certain
reputation in the world, lest, after the publication of their books, it
should be supposed they had grafted their talents upon mine. Yet as
Madam Dupin always supposed those I had to be very moderate,
and never employed me except it was to write what she dictated, or
in researches of pure erudition, the reproach, with respect to her,
would have been unjust.
This last failure of success completed my discouragement. I
abandoned every prospect of fame and advancement; and, without
further troubling my head about real or imaginary talents, with which
I had so little success, I dedicated my whole time and cares to
procure myself and Theresa a subsistence in the manner most
pleasing to those to whom it should be agreeable to provide for it. I
therefore entirely attached myself to Madam Dupin and M. de
Francueil. This did not place me in a very opulent situation; for with
eight or nine hundred livres, which I had the first two years, I had
scarcely enough to provide for my primary wants; being obliged to
live in their neighborhood, a dear part of the town, in a furnished
lodging, and having to pay for another lodging at the extremity of
Paris, at the very top of the Rue Saint Jacques, to which, let the

weather be as it would, I went almost every evening to supper. I
soon got into the track of my new occupations, and conceived a
taste for them. I attached myself to the study of chemistry, and
attended several courses of it with M. de Francueil at M. Rouelle's,
and we began to scribble over paper upon that science, of which we
scarcely possessed the elements. In
, we went to pass the
autumn in Tourraine, at the castle of Chenonceaux, a royal mansion
upon the Cher, built by Henry the II, for Diana of Poitiers, of whom
the ciphers are still seen, and which is now in the possession of M.
Dupin, a farmer general. We amused ourselves very agreeably in
this beautiful place, and lived very well: I became as fat there as a
monk. Music was a favorite relaxation. I composed several trios full
of harmony, and of which I may perhaps speak in my supplement if
ever I should write one. Theatrical performances were another
resource. I wrote a comedy in fifteen days, entitled 'l'Engagement
Temeraire',--[The Rash Engagement]--which will be found amongst
my papers; it has no other merit than that of being lively. I composed
several other little things: amongst others a poem entitled, 'l'Aliee de
Sylvie', from the name of an alley in the park upon the bank of the
Cher; and this without discontinuing my chemical studies, or
interrupting what I had to do for Madam Dupin.
Whilst I was increasing my corpulency at Chenonceaux, that of my
poor Theresa was augmented at Paris in another manner, and at my
return I found the work I had put upon the frame in greater
forwardness than I had expected. This, on account of my situation,
would have thrown me into the greatest embarrassment, had not one
of my messmates furnished me with the only resource which could
relieve me from it. This is one of those essential narratives which I
cannot give with too much simplicity; because, in making an
improper use of their names, I should either excuse or inculpate
myself, both of which in this place are entirely out of the question.
During the residence of Altuna at Paris, instead of going to eat at a
'Traiteurs', he and I commonly eat in the neighborhood, almost
opposite the cul de sac of the opera, at the house of a Madam la
Selle, the wife of a tailor, who gave but very ordinary dinners, but
whose table was much frequented on account of the safe company
which generally resorted to it; no person was received without being

introduced by one of those who used the house. The commander,
De Graville, an old debauchee, with much wit and politeness, but
obscene in conversation, lodged at the house, and brought to it a set
of riotous and extravagant young men; officers in the guards and
mousquetaires. The Commander de Nonant, chevalier to all the girls
of the opera, was the daily oracle, who conveyed to us the news of
this motley crew. M. du Plessis, a lieutenant-colonel, retired from the
service, an old man of great goodness and wisdom; and M. Ancelet,
an officer in the mousquetaires kept the young people in a certain
kind of order.
[It was to this M. Ancelet I gave a little comedy, after my
own
manner entitled 'les Prisouniers de Guerre', which I wrote
after the
disasters of the French in Bavaria and Bohemia: I dared not
either
avow this comedy or show it, and this for the singular
reason that
neither the King of France nor the French were ever better
spoken of
nor praised with more sincerity of heart than in my piece
though
written by a professed republican, I dared not declare
myself the
panegyrist of a nation, whose maxims were exactly the
reverse of my
own. More grieved at the misfortunes of France than the
French
themselves I was afraid the public would construe into
flattery and
mean complaisance the marks of a sincere attachment, of
which in my
first part I have mentioned the date and the cause, and
which I was
ashamed to show.]

This table was also frequented by commercial people, financiers
and contractors, but extremely polite, and such as were
distinguished amongst those of the same profession. M. de Besse,
M. de Forcade, and others whose names I have forgotten, in short,
well-dressed people of every description were seen there; except
abbes and men of the long robe, not one of whom I ever met in the
house, and it was agreed not to introduce men of either of these
professions. This table, sufficiently resorted to, was very cheerful
without being noisy, and many of the guests were waggish, without
descending to vulgarity. The old commander with all his smutty
stories, with respect to the substance, never lost sight of the
politeness of the old court; nor did any indecent expression, which
even women would not have pardoned him, escape his lips. His
manner served as a rule to every person at table; all the young men
related their adventures of gallantry with equal grace and freedom,
and these narratives were the more complete, as the seraglio was at
the door; the entry which led to it was the same; for there was a
communication between this and the shop of Le Duchapt, a
celebrated milliner, who at that time had several very pretty girls, with
whom our young people went to chat before or after dinner. I should
thus have amused myself as well as the rest, had I been less
modest: I had only to go in as they did, but this I never had courage
enough to do. With respect to Madam de Selle, I often went to eat at
her house after the departure of Altuna. I learned a great number of
amusing anecdotes, and by degrees I adopted, thank God, not the
morals, but the maxims I found to be established there. Honest men
injured, husbands deceived, women seduced, were the most
ordinary topics, and he who had best filled the foundling hospital was
always the most applauded. I caught the manners I daily had before
my eyes: I formed my manner of thinking upon that I observed to be
the reigning one amongst amiable: and upon the whole, very honest
people. I said to myself, since it is the custom of the country, they
who live here may adopt it; this is the expedient for which I sought. I
cheerfully determined upon it without the least scruple, and the only
one I had to overcome was that of Theresa, whom, with the greatest
imaginable difficulty, I persuaded to adopt this only means of saving
her honor. Her mother, who was moreover apprehensive of a new

embarrassment by an increase of family, came to my aid, and she at
length suffered herself to be prevailed upon. We made choice of a
midwife, a safe and prudent woman, Mademoiselle Gouin, who lived
at the Point Saint Eustache, and when the time came, Theresa was
conducted to her house by her mother.
I went thither several times to see her, and gave her a cipher
which I had made double upon two cards; one of them was put into
the linen of the child, and by the midwife deposited with the infant in
the office of the foundling hospital according to the customary form.
The year following, a similar inconvenience was remedied by the
same expedient, excepting the cipher, which was forgotten: no more
reflection on my part, nor approbation on that of the mother; she
obeyed with trembling. All the vicissitudes which this fatal conduct
has produced in my manner of thinking, as well as in my destiny, will
be successively seen. For the present, we will confine ourselves to
this first period; its cruel and unforeseen consequences will but too
frequently oblige me to refer to it.
I here mark that of my first acquaintance with Madam D'Epinay,
whose name will frequently appear in these memoirs. She was a
Mademoiselle D' Esclavelles, and had lately been married to M.
D'Epinay, son of M. de Lalive de Bellegarde, a farmer general. She
understood music, and a passion for the art produced between these
three persons the greatest intimacy. Madam Prancueil introduced me
to Madam D'Epinay, and we sometimes supped together at her
house. She was amiable, had wit and talent, and was certainly a
desirable acquaintance; but she had a female friend, a Mademoiselle
d'Ette, who was said to have much malignancy in her disposition;
she lived with the Chevalier de Valory, whose temper was far from
being one of the best. I am of opinion, an acquaintance with these
two persons was prejudicial to Madam D'Epinay, to whom, with a
disposition which required the greatest attention from those about
her, nature had given very excellent qualities to regulate or
counterbalance her extravagant pretensions. M. de Francueil
inspired her with a part of the friendship he had conceived for me,
and told me of the connection between them, of which, for that
reason, I would not now speak, were it not become so public as not
to be concealed from M. D'Epinay himself.

M. de Francueil confided to me secrets of a very singular nature
relative to this lady, of which she herself never spoke to me, nor so
much as suspected my having a knowledge; for I never opened my
lips to her upon the subject, nor will I ever do it to any person. The
confidence all parties had in my prudence rendered my situation very
embarrassing, especially with Madam de Francueil, whose
knowledge of me was sufficient to remove from her all suspicion on
my account, although I was connected with her rival. I did everything
I could to console this poor woman, whose husband certainly did not
return the affection she had for him. I listened to these three persons
separately; I kept all their secrets so faithfully that not one of the
three ever drew from me those of the two others, and this, without
concealing from either of the women my attachment to each of them.
Madam de Francueil, who frequently wished to make me an agent,
received refusals in form, and Madam D'Epinay, once desiring me to
charge myself with a letter to M. de Francueil received the same
mortification, accompanied by a very express declaration, that if ever
she wished to drive me forever from the house, she had only a
second time to make me a like proposition.
In justice to Madam D'Epinay, I must say, that far from being
offended with me she spoke of my conduct to M. de Francueil in
terms of the highest approbation, and continued to receive me as
well, and as politely as ever. It was thus, amidst the heart-burnings of
three persons to whom I was obliged to behave with the greatest
circumspection, on whom I in some measure depended, and for
whom I had conceived an attachment, that by conducting myself with
mildness and complaisance, although accompanied with the greatest
firmness, I preserved unto the last not only their friendship, but their
esteem and confidence. Notwithstanding my absurdities and
awkwardness, Madam D'Epinay would have me make one of the
party to the Chevrette, a country-house, near Saint Denis, belonging
to M. de Bellegarde. There was a theatre, in which performances
were not unfrequent. I had a part given me, which I studied for six
months without intermission, and in which, on the evening of the
representation, I was obliged to be prompted from the beginning to
the end. After this experiment no second proposal of the kind was
ever made to me.

My acquaintance with M. D'Epinay procured me that of her sisterin-law, Mademoiselle de Bellegarde, who soon afterwards became
Countess of Houdetot. The first time I saw her she was upon the
point of marriage; when she conversed with me a long time, with that
charming familiarity which was natural to her. I thought her very
amiable, but I was far from perceiving that this young person would
lead me, although innocently, into the abyss in which I still remain.
Although I have not spoken of Diderot since my return from
Venice, no more than of my friend M. Roguin, I did not neglect either
of them, especially the former, with whom I daily became more
intimate. He had a Nannette, as well as I a Theresa; this was
between us another conformity of circumstances. But my Theresa,
as fine a woman as his Nannette, was of a mild and amiable
character, which might gain and fix the affections of a worthy man;
whereas Nannette was a vixen, a troublesome prater, and had no
qualities in the eyes of others which in any measure compensated
for her want of education. However he married her, which was well
done of him, if he had given a promise to that effect. I, for my part,
not having entered into any such engagement, was not in the least
haste to imitate him.
I was also connected with the Abbe de Condillac, who had
acquired no more literary fame than myself, but in whom there was
every appearance of his becoming what he now is. I was perhaps
the first who discovered the extent of his abilities, and esteemed
them as they deserved. He on his part seemed satisfied with me,
and, whilst shut up in my chamber in the Rue Jean Saint Denis, near
the opera-house, I composed my act of Hesiod, he sometimes came
to dine with me tete-a-tete. We sent for our dinner, and paid share
and share alike. He was at that time employed on his Essay on the
Origin of Human Knowledge, which was his first work. When this
was finished, the difficulty was to find a bookseller who would take it.
The booksellers of Paris are shy of every author at his beginning,
and metaphysics, not much then in vogue, were no very inviting
subject. I spoke to Diderot of Condillac and his work, and I
afterwards brought them acquainted with each other. They were
worthy of each other's esteem, and were presently on the most
friendly terms. Diderot persuaded the bookseller, Durand, to take the

manuscript from the abbe, and this great metaphysician received for
his first work, and almost as a favor, a hundred crowns, which
perhaps he would not have obtained without my assistance. As we
lived in a quarter of the town very distant from each other, we all
assembled once a week at the Palais Royal, and went to dine at the
Hotel du Panier Fleuri. These little weekly dinners must have been
extremely pleasing to Diderot; for he who failed in almost all his
appointments never missed one of these. At our little meeting I
formed the plan of a periodical paper, entitled 'le Persifleur'--[The
Jeerer] --which Diderot and I were alternately to write. I sketched out
the first sheet, and this brought me acquainted with D'Alembert, to
whom Diderot had mentioned it. Unforeseen events frustrated our
intention, and the project was carried no further.
These two authors had just undertaken the 'Dictionnaire
Encyclopedique', which at first was intended to be nothing more than
a kind of translation of Chambers, something like that of the Medical
Dictionary of James, which Diderot had just finished. Diderot was
desirous I should do something in this second undertaking, and
proposed to me the musical part, which I accepted. This I executed
in great haste, and consequently very ill, in the three months he had
given me, as well as all the authors who were engaged in the work.
But I was the only person in readiness at the time prescribed. I gave
him my manuscript, which I had copied by a laquais, belonging to M.
de Francueil of the name of Dupont, who wrote very well. I paid him
ten crowns out of my own pocket, and these have never been
reimbursed me. Diderot had promised me a retribution on the part of
the booksellers, of which he has never since spoken to me nor I to
him.
This undertaking of the 'Encyclopedie' was interrupted by his
imprisonment. The 'Pensees Philosophiquiest' drew upon him some
temporary inconvenience which had no disagreeable consequences.
He did not come off so easily on account of the 'Lettre sur les
Aveugles', --[Letter concerning blind persons.]--in which there was
nothing reprehensible, but some personal attacks with which Madam
du Pre St. Maur, and M. de Raumur were displeased: for this he was
confined in the dungeon of Vincennes. Nothing can describe the
anguish I felt on account of the misfortunes of my friend. My

wretched imagination, which always sees everything in the worst
light, was terrified. I imagined him to be confined for the remainder of
his life. I was almost distracted with the thought. I wrote to Madam
de Pompadour, beseeching her to release him or obtain an order to
shut me up in the same dungeon. I received no answer to my letter:
this was too reasonable to be efficacious, and I do not flatter myself
that it contributed to the alleviation which, some time afterwards, was
granted to the severities of the confinement of poor Diderot. Had this
continued for any length of time with the same rigor, I verily believe I
should have died in despair at the foot of the hated dungeon.
However, if my letter produced but little effect, I did not on account of
it attribute to myself much merit, for I mentioned it but to very few
people, and never to Diderot himself.

At the end of the preceding book a pause was necessary. With this
begins the long chain of my misfortunes deduced from their origin.
Having lived in the two most splendid houses in Paris, I had,
notwithstanding my candor and modesty, made some acquaintance.
Among others at Dupin's, that of the young hereditary prince of
Saxe-Gotha, and of the Baron de Thun, his governor; at the house of
M. de la Popliniere, that of M. Seguy, friend to the Baron de Thun,
and known in the literary world by his beautiful edition of Rousseau.
The baron invited M. Seguy and myself to go and pass a day or two
at Fontenai sous bois, where the prince had a house. As I passed
Vincennes, at the sight of the dungeon, my feelings were acute; the
effect of which the baron perceived on my countenance. At supper
the prince mentioned the confinement of Diderot. The baron, to hear
what I had to say, accused the prisoner of imprudence; and I showed
not a little of the same in the impetuous manner in which I defended
him. This excess of zeal, inspired by the misfortune which had
befallen my friend, was pardoned, and the conversation immediately
changed. There were present two Germans in the service of the
prince. M. Klupssel, a man of great wit, his chaplain, and who
afterwards, having supplanted the baron, became his governor. The
other was a young man named M. Grimm, who served him as a
reader until he could obtain some place, and whose indifferent
appearance sufficiently proved the pressing necessity he was under
of immediately finding one. From this very evening Klupssel and I
began an acquaintance which soon led to friendship. That with the
Sieur Grimm did not make quite so rapid a progress; he made but
few advances, and was far from having that haughty presumption

which prosperity afterwards gave him. The next day at dinner, the
conversation turned upon music; he spoke well on the subject. I was
transported with joy when I learned from him he could play an
accompaniment on the harpsichord. After dinner was over music
was introduced, and we amused ourselves the rest of the afternoon
on the harpischord of the prince. Thus began that friendship which,
at first, was so agreeable to me, afterwards so fatal, and of which I
shall hereafter have so much to say.
At my return to Paris, I learned the agreeable news that Diderot
was released from the dungeon, and that he had on his parole the
castle and park of Vincennes for a prison, with permission to see his
friends. How painful was it to me not to be able instantly to fly to him!
But I was detained two or three days at Madam Dupin's by
indispensable business. After ages of impatience, I flew to the arms
of my friend. He was not alone: D' Alembert and the treasurer of the
Sainte Chapelle were with him. As I entered I saw nobody but
himself, I made but one step, one cry; I riveted my face to his: I
pressed him in my arms, without speaking to him, except by tears
and sighs: I stifled him with my affection and joy. The first thing he
did, after quitting my arms, was to turn himself towards the
ecclesiastic, and say: "You see, sir, how much I am beloved by my
friends." My emotion was so great, that it was then impossible for me
to reflect upon this manner of turning it to advantage; but I have
since thought that, had I been in the place of Diderot, the idea he
manifested would not have been the first that would have occurred to
me.
I found him much affected by his imprisonment. The dungeon had
made a terrible impression upon his mind, and, although he was very
agreeably situated in the castle, and at liberty to, walk where he
pleased in the park, which was not inclosed even by a wall, he
wanted the society of his friends to prevent him from yielding to
melancholy. As I was the person most concerned for his sufferings, I
imagined I should also be the friend, the sight of whom would give
him consolation; on which account, notwithstanding very pressing
occupations, I went every two days at farthest, either alone, or
accompanied by his wife, to pass the afternoon with him.

The heat of the summer was this year (
) excessive.
Vincennes is two leagues from Paris. The state of my finances not
permitting me to pay for hackney coaches, at two o'clock in the
afternoon, I went on foot, when alone, and walked as fast as
possible, that I might arrive the sooner. The trees by the side of the
road, always lopped, according to the custom of the country,
afforded but little shade, and exhausted by fatigue, I frequently threw
myself on the ground, being unable to proceed any further. I thought
a book in my hand might make me moderate my pace. One day I
took the Mercure de France, and as I walked and read, I came to the
following question proposed by the academy of Dijon, for the
premium of the ensuing year, 'Has the progress of sciences and arts
contributed to corrupt or purify morals?'
The moment I had read this, I seemed to behold another world,
and became a different man. Although I have a lively remembrance
of the impression it made upon me, the detail has escaped my mind,
since I communicated it to M. de Malesherbes in one of my four
letters to him. This is one of the singularities of my memory which
merits to be remarked. It serves me in proportion to my dependence
upon it; the moment I have committed to paper that with which it was
charged, it forsakes me, and I have no sooner written a thing than I
had forgotten it entirely. This singularity is the same with respect to
music. Before I learned the use of notes I knew a great number of
songs; the moment I had made a sufficient progress to sing an air
set to music, I could not recollect any one of them; and, at present, I
much doubt whether I should be able entirely to go through one of
those of which I was the most fond. All I distinctly recollect upon this
occasion is, that on my arrival at Vincennes, I was in an agitation
which approached a delirium. Diderot perceived it; I told him the
cause, and read to him the prosopopoeia of Fabricius, written with a
pencil under a tree. He encouraged me to pursue my ideas, and to
become a competitor for the premium. I did so, and from that
moment I was ruined.
All the rest of my misfortunes during my life were the inevitable
effect of this moment of error.
My sentiments became elevated with the most inconceivable
rapidity to the level of my ideas. All my little passions were stifled by

the enthusiasm of truth, liberty, and virtue; and, what is most
astonishing, this effervescence continued in my mind upwards of five
years, to as great a degree perhaps as it has ever done in that of
any other man. I composed the discourse in a very singular manner,
and in that style which I have always followed in my other works. I
dedicated to it the hours of the night in which sleep deserted me, I
meditated in my bed with my eyes closed, and in my mind turned
over and over again my periods with incredible labor and care; the
moment they were finished to my satisfaction, I deposited them in
my memory, until I had an opportunity of committing them to paper;
but the time of rising and putting on my clothes made me lose
everything, and when I took up my pen I recollected but little of what
I had composed. I made Madam le Vasseur my secretary; I had
lodged her with her daughter, and husband, nearer to myself; and
she, to save me the expense of a servant, came every morning to
make my fire, and to do such other little things as were necessary.
As soon as she arrived I dictated to her while in bed what I had
composed in the night, and this method, which for a long time I
observed, preserved me many things I should otherwise have
forgotten.
As soon as the discourse was finished, I showed it to Diderot. He
was satisfied with the production, and pointed out some corrections
he thought necessary to be made.
However, this composition, full of force and fire, absolutely wants
logic and order; of all the works I ever wrote, this is the weakest in
reasoning, and the most devoid of number and harmony. With
whatever talent a man may be born, the art of writing is not easily
learned.
I sent off this piece without mentioning it to anybody, except, I
think, to Grimm, with whom, after his going to live with the Comte de
Vriese, I began to be upon the most intimate footing. His harpsichord
served as a rendezvous, and I passed with him at it all the moments
I had to spare, in singing Italian airs, and barcaroles; sometimes
without intermission, from morning till night, or rather from night until
morning; and when I was not to be found at Madam Dupin's,
everybody concluded I was with Grimm at his apartment, the public
walk, or theatre. I left off going to the Comedie Italienne, of which I

was free, to go with him, and pay, to the Comedie Francoise, of
which he was passionately fond. In short, so powerful an attraction
connected me with this young man, and I became so inseparable
from him, that the poor aunt herself was rather neglected, that is, I
saw her less frequently; for in no moment of my life has my
attachment to her been diminished.
This impossibility of dividing, in favor of my inclinations, the little
time I had to myself, renewed more strongly than ever the desire I
had long entertained of having but one home for Theresa and
myself; but the embarrassment of her numerous family, and
especially the want of money to purchase furniture, had hitherto
withheld me from accomplishing it. An opportunity to endeavor at it
presented itself, and of this I took advantage. M. de Francueil and
Madam Dupin, clearly perceiving that eight or nine hundred livres a
year were unequal to my wants, increased of their own accord, my
salary to fifty guineas; and Madam Dupin, having heard I wished to
furnish myself lodgings, assisted me with some articles for that
purpose. With this furniture and that Theresa already had, we made
one common stock, and, having an apartment in the Hotel de
Languedoc, Rue de Grevelle St, Honor, kept by very honest people,
we arranged ourselves in the best manner we could, and lived there
peaceably and agreeably during seven years, at the end of which I
removed to go and live at the Hermitage.
Theresa's father was a good old man, very mild in his disposition,
and much afraid of his wife; for this reason he had given her the
surname of Lieutenant Criminal, which Grimm, jocosely, afterwards
transferred to the daughter. Madam le Vasseur did not want sense,
that is address; and pretended to the politeness and airs of the first
circles; but she had a mysterious wheedling, which to me was
insupportable, gave bad advice to her daughter, endeavored to make
her dissemble with me, and separately, cajoled my friends at my
expense, and that of each other; excepting these circumstances; she
was a tolerably good mother, because she found her account in
being so, and concealed the faults of her daughter to turn them to
her own advantage. This woman, who had so much of my care and
attention, to whom I made so many little presents, and by whom I
had it extremely at heart to make myself beloved, was, from the

impossibility of my succeeding in this wish, the only cause of the
uneasiness I suffered in my little establishment. Except the effects of
this cause I enjoyed, during these six or seven, years, the most
perfect domestic happiness of which human weakness is capable.
The heart of my Theresa was that of an angel; our attachment
increased with our intimacy, and we were more and more daily
convinced how much we were made for each other. Could our
pleasures be described, their simplicity would cause laughter. Our
walks, tete-a-tete, on the outside of the city, where I magnificently
spent eight or ten sous in each guinguette.--[Ale-house]--Our little
suppers at my window, seated opposite to each other upon two little
chairs, placed upon a trunk, which filled up the spare of the
embrasure. In this situation the window served us as a table, we
respired the fresh air, enjoyed the prospect of the environs and the
people who passed; and, although upon the fourth story, looked
down into the street as we ate.
Who can describe, and how few can feel, the charms of these
repasts, consisting of a quartern loaf, a few cherries, a morsel of
cheese, and half-a-pint of wine which we drank between us?
Friendship, confidence, intimacy, sweetness of disposition, how
delicious are your reasonings! We sometimes remained in this
situation until midnight, and never thought of the hour, unless
informed of it by the old lady. But let us quit these details, which are
either insipid or laughable; I have always said and felt that real
enjoyment was not to be described.
Much about the same time I indulged in one not so delicate, and
the last of the kind with which I have to reproach myself. I have
observed that the minister Klupssel was an amiable man; my
connections with him were almost as intimate as those I had with
Grimm, and in the end became as familiar; Grimm and he
sometimes eat at my apartment. These repasts, a little more than
simple, were enlivened by the witty and extravagant wantonness of
expression of Klupssel, and the diverting Germanicisms of Grimm,
who was not yet become a purist.
Sensuality did not preside at our little orgies, but joy, which was
preferable, reigned in them all, and we enjoyed ourselves so well
together that we knew not how to separate. Klupssel had furnished a

lodging for a little girl, who, notwithstanding this, was at the service
of anybody, because he could not support her entirely himself. One
evening as we were going into the coffee-house, we met him coming
out to go and sup with her. We rallied him; he revenged himself
gallantly, by inviting us to the same supper, and there rallying us in
our turn. The poor young creature appeared to be of a good
disposition, mild and little fitted to the way of life to which an old hag
she had with her, prepared her in the best manner she could. Wine
and conversation enlivened us to such a degree that we forgot
ourselves. The amiable Klupssel was unwilling to do the honors of
his table by halves, and we all three successively took a view of the
next chamber, in company with his little friend, who knew not
whether she should laugh or cry. Grimm has always maintained that
he never touched her; it was therefore to amuse himself with our
impatience, that he remained so long in the other chamber, and if he
abstained, there is not much probability of his having done so from
scruple, because previous to his going to live with the Comte de
Friese, he lodged with girls of the town in the same quarter of St.
Roch.
I left the Rue des Moineaux, where this girl lodged, as much
ashamed as Saint Preux left the house in which he had become
intoxicated, and when I wrote his story I well remembered my own.
Theresa perceived by some sign, and especially by my confusion, I
had something with which I reproached myself; I relieved my mind by
my free and immediate confession. I did well, for the next day Grimm
came in triumph to relate to her my crime with aggravation, and
since that time he has never failed maliciously to recall it to her
recollection; in this he was the more culpable, since I had freely and
voluntarily given him my confidence, and had a right to expect he
would not make me repent of it. I never had a more convincing proof
than on this occasion, of the goodness of my Theresa's heart; she
was more shocked at the behavior of Grimm than at my infidelity,
and I received nothing from her but tender reproaches, in which
there was not the least appearance of anger.
The simplicity of mind of this excellent girl was equal to her
goodness of heart; and this is saying everything: but one instance of
it, which is present to my recollection, is worthy of being related. I

had told her Klupssel was a minister, and chaplain to the prince of
Saxe-Gotha. A minister was to her so singular a man, that oddly
confounding the most dissimilar ideas, she took it into her head to
take Klupssel for the pope; I thought her mad the first time she told
me when I came in, that the pope had called to see me. I made her
explain herself and lost not a moment in going to relate the story to
Grimm and Klupssel, who amongst ourselves never lost the name of
pope. We gave to the girl in the Rue des Moineaux the name of
Pope Joan. Our laughter was incessant; it almost stifled us. They,
who in a letter which it hath pleased them to attribute to me, have
made me say I never laughed but twice in my life, did not know me
at this period, nor in my younger days; for if they had, the idea could
never have entered into their heads.
The year following (
), not thinking more of my discourse; I
learned it had gained the premium at Dijon. This news awakened all
the ideas which had dictated it to me, gave them new animation, and
completed the fermentation of my heart of that first leaven of heroism
and virtue which my father, my country, and Plutarch had inspired in
my infancy. Nothing now appeared great in my eyes but to be free
and virtuous, superior to fortune and opinion, and independent of all
exterior circumstances; although a false shame, and the fear of
disapprobation at first prevented me from conducting myself
according to these principles, and from suddenly quarreling with the
maxims of the age in which I lived, I from that moment took a
decided resolution to do it.--[And of this I purposely delayed the
execution, that irritated by contradiction f it might be rendered
triumphant.]
While I was philosophizing upon the duties of man, an event
happened which made me better reflect upon my own. Theresa
became pregnant for the third time. Too sincere with myself, too
haughty in my mind to contradict my principles by my actions, I
began to examine the destination of my children, and my
connections with the mother, according to the laws of nature, justice,
and reason, and those of that religion, pure, holy, and eternal, like its
author, which men have polluted while they pretended to purify it,
and which by their formularies they have reduced to a religion of

words, since the difficulty of prescribing impossibilities is but trifling
to those by whom they are not practised.
If I deceived myself in my conclusions, nothing can be more
astonishing than the security with which I depended upon them.
Were I one of those men unfortunately born deaf to the voice of
nature, in whom no sentiment of justice or humanity ever took the
least root, this obduracy would be natural. But that warmth of heart,
strong sensibility, and facility of forming attachments; the force with
which they subdue me; my cruel sufferings when obliged to break
them; the innate benevolence I cherished towards my fellowcreatures; the ardent love I bear to great virtues, to truth and justice,
the horror in which I hold evil of every kind; the impossibility of
hating, of injuring or wishing to injure anyone; the soft and lively
emotion I feel at the sight of whatever is virtuous, generous and
amiable; can these meet in the same mind with the depravity which
without scruple treads under foot the most pleasing of all our duties?
No, I feel, and openly declare this to be impossible. Never in his
whole life could J. J. be a man without sentiment or an unnatural
father. I may have been deceived, but it is impossible I should have
lost the least of my feelings. Were I to give my reasons, I should say
too much; since they have seduced me, they would seduce many
others. I will not therefore expose those young persons by whom I
may be read to the same danger. I will satisfy myself by observing
that my error was such, that in abandoning my children to public
education for want of the means of bringing them up myself; in
destining them to become workmen and peasants, rather than
adventurers and fortune-hunters, I thought I acted like an honest
citizen, and a good father, and considered myself as a member of
the republic of Plato. Since that time the regrets of my heart have
more than once told me I was deceived; but my reason was so far
from giving me the same intimation, that I have frequently returned
thanks to Heaven for having by this means preserved them from the
fate of their father, and that by which they were threatened the
moment I should have been under the necessity of leaving them.
Had I left them to Madam d'Upinay, or Madam de Luxembourg, who,
from friendship, generosity, or some other motive, offered to take
care of them in due time, would they have been more happy, better

brought up, or honester men? To this I cannot answer; but I am
certain they would have been taught to hate and perhaps betray their
parents: it is much better that they have never known them.
My third child was therefore carried to the foundling hospital as
well as the two former, and the next two were disposed of in the
same manner; for I have had five children in all. This arrangement
seemed to me to be so good, reasonable and lawful, that if I did not
publicly boast of it, the motive by which I was withheld was merely
my regard for their mother: but I mentioned it to all those to whom I
had declared our connection, to Diderot, to Grimm, afterwards to M.
d'Epinay, and after another interval to Madam de Luxembourg; and
this freely and voluntarily, without being under the least necessity of
doing it, having it in my power to conceal the step from all the world;
for La Gouin was an honest woman, very discreet, and a person on
whom I had the greatest reliance. The only one of my friends to
whom it was in some measure my interest to open myself, was
Thierry the physician, who had the care of my poor aunt in one of her
lyings in, in which she was very ill. In a word, there was no mystery
in my conduct, not only on account of my never having concealed
anything from my friends, but because I never found any harm in it.
Everything considered, I chose the best destination for my children,
or that which I thought to be such. I could have wished, and still
should be glad, had I been brought up as they have been.
Whilst I was thus communicating what I had done, Madam. le
Vasseur did the same thing amongst her acquaintance, but with less
disinterested views. I introduced her and her daughter to Madam
Dupin, who, from friendship to me, showed them the greatest
kindness. The mother confided to her the secret of the daughter.
Madam Dupin, who is generous and kind, and to whom she never
told how attentive I was to her, notwithstanding my moderate
resources, in providing for everything, provided on her part for what
was necessary, with a liberality which, by order of her mother, the
daughter concealed from me during my residence in Paris, nor ever
mentioned it until we were at the Hermitage, when she informed me
of it, after having disclosed to me several other secrets of her heart. I
did not know Madam Dupin, who never took the least notice to me of
the matter, was so well informed: I know not yet whether Madam de

Chenonceaux, her daughter-in-law, was as much in the secret: but
Madam de Brancueil knew the whole and could not refrain from
prattling. She spoke of it to me the following year, after I had left her
house. This induced me to write her a letter upon the subject, which
will be found in my collections, and wherein I gave such of my
reasons as I could make public, without exposing Madam le Vasseur
and her family; the most determinative of them came from that
quarter, and these I kept profoundly secret.
I can rely upon the discretion of Madam Dupin, and the friendship
of Madam de Chenonceaux; I had the same dependence upon that
of Madam de Francuiel, who, however, was long dead before my
secret made its way into the world. This it could never have done
except by means of the persons to whom I intrusted it, nor did it until
after my rupture with them. By this single fact they are judged;
without exculpating myself from the blame I deserve, I prefer it to
that resulting from their malignity. My fault is great, but it was an
error. I have neglected my duty, but the desire of doing an injury
never entered my heart; and the feelings of a father were never more
eloquent in favor of children whom he never saw. But: betraying the
confidence of friendship, violating the most sacred of all
engagements, publishing secrets confided to us, and wantonly
dishonoring the friend we have deceived, and who in detaching
himself from our society still respects us, are not faults, but baseness
of mind, and the last degree of heinousness.
I have promised my confession and not my justification; on which
account I shall stop here. It is my duty faithfully to relate the truth,
that of the reader to be just; more than this I never shall require of
him.
The marriage of M. de Chenonceaux rendered his mother's house
still more agreeable to me, by the wit and merit of the new bride, a
very amiable young person, who seemed to distinguish me amongst
the scribes of M. Dupin. She was the only daughter of the
Viscountess de Rochechouart, a great friend of the Comte de Friese,
and consequently of Grimm's who was very attentive to her.
However, it was I who introduced him to her daughter; but their
characters not suiting each other, this connection was not of long
duration; and Grimm, who from that time aimed at what was solid,

preferred the mother, a woman of the world, to the daughter who
wished for steady friends, such as were agreeable to her, without
troubling her head about the least intrigue, or making any interest
amongst the great. Madam Dupin no longer finding in Madam de
Chenonceaux all the docility she expected, made her house very
disagreeable to her, and Madam de Chenonceaux, having a great
opinion of her own merit, and, perhaps, of her birth, chose rather to
give up the pleasures of society, and remain almost alone in her
apartment, than to submit to a yoke she was not disposed to bear.
This species of exile increased my attachment to her, by that natural
inclination which excites me to approach the wretched, I found her
mind metaphysical and reflective, although at times a little
sophistical; her conversation, which was by no means that of a
young woman coming from a convent, had for me the greatest
attractions; yet she was not twenty years of age. Her complexion
was seducingly fair; her figure would have been majestic had she
held herself more upright. Her hair, which was fair, bordering upon
ash color, and uncommonly beautiful, called to my recollection that of
my poor mamma in the flower of her age, and strongly agitated my
heart. But the severe principles I had just laid down for myself, by
which at all events I was determined to be guided, secured me from
the danger of her and her charms. During the whole summer I
passed three or four hours a day in a tete-a-tete conversation with
her, teaching her arithmetic, and fatiguing her with my innumerable
ciphers, without uttering a single word of gallantry, or even once
glancing my eyes upon her. Five or six years later I should not have
had so much wisdom or folly; but it was decreed I was never to love
but once in my life, and that another person was to have the first and
last sighs of my heart.
Since I had lived in the house of Madam Dupin, I had always been
satisfied with my situation, without showing the least sign of a desire
to improve it. The addition which, in conjunction with M. de Francueil,
she had made to my salary, was entirely of their own accord. This
year M. de Francueil, whose friendship for me daily increased, had it
in his thoughts to place me more at ease, and in a less precarious
situation. He was receiver-general of finance. M. Dudoyer, his cashkeeper, was old and rich, and wished to retire. M. de Francueil

offered me his place, and to prepare myself for it, I went during a few
weeks, to Dudoyer, to take the necessary instructions. But whether
my talents were ill-suited to the employment, or that M. Dudoyer,
who I thought wished to procure his place for another, was not in
earnest in the instructions he gave me, I acquired by slow degrees,
and very imperfectly, the knowledge I was in want of, and could
never understand the nature of accounts, rendered intricate, perhaps
designedly. However, without having possessed myself of the whole
scope of the business, I learned enough of the method to pursue it
without the least difficulty; I even entered on my new office; I kept the
cashbook and the cash; I paid and received money, took and gave
receipts; and although this business was so ill suited to my
inclinations as to my abilities, maturity of years beginning to render
me sedate, I was determined to conquer my disgust, and entirely
devote myself to my new employment.
Unfortunately for me, I had no sooner begun to proceed without
difficulty, than M. de Francueil took a little journey, during which I
remained intrusted with the cash, which, at that time, did not amount
to more than twenty-five to thirty thousand livres. The anxiety of mind
this sum of money occasioned me, made me perceive I was very
unfit to be a cash-keeper, and I have no doubt but my uneasy
situation, during his absence, contributed to the illness with which I
was seized after his return.
I have observed in my first part that I was born in a dying state. A
defect in the bladder caused me, during my early years, to suffer an
almost continual retention of urine, and my Aunt Susan, to whose
care I was intrusted, had inconceivable difficulty in preserving me.
However, she succeeded, and my robust constitution at length got
the better of all my weakness, and my health became so well
established that except the illness from languor, of which I have
given an account, and frequent heats in the bladder which the least
heating of the blood rendered troublesome, I arrived at the age of
thirty almost without feeling my original infirmity. The first time this
happened was upon my arrival at Venice. The fatigue of the voyage,
and the extreme heat I had suffered, renewed the burnings, and
gave me a pain in the loins, which continued until the beginning of
winter. After having seen padoana, I thought myself near the end of

my career, but I suffered not the least inconvenience. After
exhausting my imagination more than my body for my Zulietta, I
enjoyed better health than ever. It was not until after the
imprisonment of Diderot that the heat of blood, brought on by my
journeys to Vincennes during the terrible heat of that summer, gave
me a violent nephritic colic, since which I have never recovered my
primitive good state of health.
At the time of which I speak, having perhaps fatigued myself too
much in the filthy work of the cursed receiver-general's office, I fell
into a worse state than ever, and remained five or six weeks in my
bed in the most melancholy state imaginable. Madam Dupin sent me
the celebrated Morand who, notwithstanding his address and the
delicacy of his touch, made me suffer the greatest torments. He
advised me to have recourse to Daran, who, in fact gave me some
relief: but Morand, when he gave Madam Dupin an account of the
state I was in, declared to her I should not be alive in six months.
This afterwards came to my ear, and made me reflect seriously on
my situation and the folly of sacrificing the repose of the few days I
had to live to the slavery of an employment for which I felt nothing
but disgust. Besides, how was it possible to reconcile the severe
principles I had just adopted to a situation with which they had so
little relation? Should not I, the cash-keeper of a receiver-general of
finances, have preached poverty and disinterestedness with a very ill
grace? These ideas fermented so powerfully in my mind with the
fever, and were so strongly impressed, that from that time nothing
could remove them; and, during my convalescence, I confirmed
myself with the greatest coolness in the resolutions I had taken
during my delirium. I forever abandoned all projects of fortune and
advancement, resolved to pass in independence and poverty the
little time I had to exist. I made every effort of which my mind was
capable to break the fetters of prejudice, and courageously to do
everything that was right without giving myself the least concern
about the judgment of others. The obstacles I had to combat, and
the efforts I made to triumph over them, are inconceivable. I
succeeded as much as it was possible I should, and to a greater
degree than I myself had hoped for. Had I at the same time shaken
off the yoke of friendship as well as that of prejudice, my design

would have been accomplished, perhaps the greatest, at least the
most useful one to virtue, that mortal ever conceived; but whilst I
despised the foolish judgments of the vulgar tribe called great and
wise, I suffered myself to be influenced and led by persons who
called themselves my friends. These, hurt at seeing me walk alone in
a new path, while I seemed to take measures for my happiness,
used all their endeavors to render me ridiculous, and that they might
afterwards defame me, first strove to make me contemptible. It was
less my literary fame than my personal reformation, of which I here
state the period, that drew upon me their jealousy; they perhaps
might have pardoned me for having distinguished myself in the art of
writing; but they could never forgive my setting them, by my conduct,
an example, which, in their eyes, seemed to reflect on themselves. I
was born for friendship; my mind and easy disposition nourished it
without difficulty. As long as I lived unknown to the public I was
beloved by all my private acquaintance, and I had not a single
enemy. But the moment I acquired literary fame, I had no longer a
friend. This, was a great misfortune; but a still greater was that of
being surrounded by people who called themselves my friends, and
used the rights attached to that sacred name to lead me on to
destruction. The succeeding part of these memoirs will explain this
odious conspiracy. I here speak of its origin, and the manner of the
first intrigue will shortly appear.
In the independence in which I lived, it was, however, necessary to
subsist. To this effect I thought of very simple means: which were
copying music at so much a page. If any employment more solid
would have fulfilled the same end I would have taken it up; but this
occupation being to my taste, and the only one which, without
personal attendance, could procure me daily bread, I adopted it.
Thinking I had no longer need of foresight, and, stifling the vanity of
cash-keeper to a financier, I made myself a copyist of music. I
thought I had made an advantageous choice, and of this I so little
repented, that I never quitted my new profession until I was forced to
do it, after taking a fixed resolution to return to it as soon as possible.
The success of my first discourse rendered the execution of this
resolution more easy. As soon as it had gained the premium, Diderot
undertook to get it printed. Whilst I was in my bed, he wrote me a

note informing me of the publication and effect: "It takes," said he,
"beyond all imagination; never was there an instance of alike
success."
This favor of the public, by no means solicited, and to an unknown
author, gave me the first real assurance of my talents, of which,
notwithstanding an internal sentiment, I had always had my doubts. I
conceived the great advantage to be drawn from it in favor of the
way of life I had determined to pursue; and was of opinion, that a
copyist of some celebrity in the republic of letters was not likely to
want employment.
The moment my resolution was confirmed, I wrote a note to M, de
Francueil, communicating to him my intentions, thanking him and
Madam Dupin for all goodness, and offering them my services in the
way of my new profession. Francueil did not understand my note,
and, thinking I was still in the delirium of fever, hastened to my
apartment; but he found me so determined, that all he could say to
me was without the least effect. He went to Madam Dupin, and told
her and everybody he met, that I had become insane. I let him say
what he pleased, and pursued the plan I had conceived. I began the
change in my dress; I quitted laced clothes and white stockings; I put
on a round wig, laid aside my sword, and sold my watch; saying to
myself, with inexpressible pleasure: "Thank Heaven! I shall no longer
want to know the hour!" M. de Francueil had the goodness to wait a
considerable time before he disposed of my place. At length
perceiving me inflexibly resolved, he gave it to M. d'Alibard, formerly
tutor to the young Chenonceaux, and known as a botanist by his
Flora Parisiensis.
[I doubt not but these circumstances are now differently
related by
M. Francueil and his consorts: but I appeal to what he said
of them
at the time and long afterwards, to everybody he knew, until
the
forming of the conspiracy, and of which men of common
sense and
honor, must have preserved a remembrance.]

However austere my sumptuary reform might be, I did not at first
extend it to my linen, which was fine and in great quantity, the
remainder of my stock when at Venice, and to which I was
particularly attached. I had made it so much an object of cleanliness,
that it became one of luxury, which was rather expensive. Some
persons, however, did me the favor to deliver me from this servitude.
On Christmas Eve, whilst the governesses were at vespers, and I
was at the spiritual concert, the door of a garret, in which all our linen
was hung up after being washed, was broken open. Everything was
stolen; and amongst other things, forty-two of my shirts, of very fine
linen, and which were the principal part of my stock. By the manner
in which the neighbors described a man whom they had seen come
out of the hotel with several parcels whilst we were all absent,
Theresa and myself suspected her brother, whom we knew to be a
worthless man. The mother strongly endeavored to remove this
suspicion, but so many circumstances concurred to prove it to be
well founded, that, notwithstanding all she could say, our opinions
remained still the same: I dared not make a strict search for fear of
finding more than I wished to do. The brother never returned to the
place where I lived, and, at length, was no more heard of by any of
us. I was much grieved Theresa and myself should be connected
with such a family, and I exhorted her more than ever to shake off so
dangerous a yoke. This adventure cured me of my inclination for fine
linen, and since that time all I have had has been very common, and
more suitable to the rest of my dress.
Having thus completed the change of that which related to my
person, all my cares tendered to render it solid and lasting, by
striving to root out from my heart everything susceptible of receiving
an impression from the judgment of men, or which, from the fear of
blame, might turn me aside from anything good and reasonable in
itself. In consequence of the success of my work, my resolution
made some noise in the world also, and procured me employment;
so that I began my new profession with great appearance of
success. However, several causes prevented me from succeeding in
it to the same degree I should under any other circumstances have
done. In the first place my ill state of health. The attack I had just
had, brought on consequences which prevented my ever being so

well as I was before; and I am of opinion, the physicians, to whose
care I intrusted myself, did me as much harm as my illness. I was
successively under the hands of Morand, Daran, Helvetius, Malouin,
and Thyerri: men able in their profession, and all of them my friends,
who treated me each according to his own manner, without giving
me the least relief, and weakened me considerably. The more I
submitted to their direction, the yellower, thinner, and weaker I
became. My imagination, which they terrified, judging of my situation
by the effect of their drugs, presented to me, on this side of the tomb,
nothing but continued sufferings from the gravel, stone, and retention
of urine. Everything which gave relief to others, ptisans, baths, and
bleeding, increased my tortures. Perceiving the bougees of Daran,
the only ones that had any favorable effect, and without which I
thought I could no longer exist, to give me a momentary relief, I
procured a prodigious number of them, that, in case of Daran's
death, I might never be at a loss. During the eight or ten years in
which I made such frequent use of these, they must, with what I had
left, have cost me fifty louis.
It will easily be judged, that such expensive and painful means did
not permit me to work without interruption; and that a dying man is
not ardently industrious in the business by which he gains his daily
bread.
Literary occupations caused another interruption not less
prejudicial to my daily employment. My discourse had no sooner
appeared than the defenders of letters fell upon me as if they had
agreed with each to do it. My indignation was so raised at seeing so
many blockheads, who did not understand the question, attempt to
decide upon it imperiously, that in my answer I gave some of them
the worst of it. One M. Gautier, of Nancy, the first who fell under the
lash of my pen, was very roughly treated in a letter to M. Grimm. The
second was King Stanislaus, himself, who did not disdain to enter
the lists with me. The honor he did me, obliged me to change my
manner in combating his opinions; I made use of a graver style, but
not less nervous; and without failing in respect to the author, I
completely refuted his work. I knew a Jesuit, Father de Menou, had
been concerned in it. I depended on my judgment to distinguish what
was written by the prince, from the production of the monk, and

falling without mercy upon all the jesuitical phrases, I remarked, as I
went along, an anachronism which I thought could come from
nobody but the priest. This composition, which, for what reason I
knew not, has been less spoken of than any of my other writings, is
the only one of its kind. I seized the opportunity which offered of
showing to the public in what manner an individual may defend the
cause of truth even against a sovereign. It is difficult to adopt a more
dignified and respectful manner than that in which I answered him. I
had the happiness to have to do with an adversary to whom, without
adulation, I could show every mark of the esteem of which my heart
was full; and this I did with success and a proper dignity. My friends,
concerned for my safety, imagined they already saw me in the
Bastile. This apprehension never once entered my head, and I was
right in not being afraid. The good prince, after reading my answer,
said: "I have enough of at; I will not return to the charge." I have,
since that time received from him different marks of esteem and
benevolence, some of which I shall have occasion to speak of; and
what I had written was read in France, and throughout Europe,
without meeting the least censure.
In a little time I had another adversary whom I had not expected;
this was the same M. Bordes, of Lyons, who ten years before had
shown me much friendship, and from whom I had received several
services. I had not forgotten him, but had neglected him from
idleness, and had not sent him my writings for want of an
opportunity, without seeking for it, to get them conveyed to his
hands. I was therefore in the wrong, and he attacked me; this,
however, he did politely, and I answered in the same manner. He
replied more decidedly. This produced my last answer; after which I
heard no more from him upon the subject; but he became my most
violent enemy, took the advantage of the time of my misfortunes, to
publish against me the most indecent libels, and made a journey to
London on purpose to do me an injury.
All this controversy employed me a good deal, and caused me a
great loss of my time in my copying, without much contributing to the
progress of truth, or the good of my purse. Pissot, at that time my
bookseller, gave me but little for my pamphlets, frequently nothing at
all, and I never received a farthing for my first discourse. Diderot

gave it him. I was obliged to wait a long time for the little he gave me,
and to take it from him in the most trifling sums. Notwithstanding this,
my copying went on but slowly. I had two things together upon my
hands, which was the most likely means of doing them both ill.
They were very opposite to each other in their effects by the
different manners of living to which they rendered me subject. The
success of my first writings had given me celebrity. My new situation
excited curiosity. Everybody wished to know that whimsical man who
sought not the acquaintance of any one, and whose only desire was
to live free and happy in the manner he had chosen; this was
sufficient to make the thing impossible to me. My apartment was
continually full of people, who, under different pretences, came to
take up my time. The women employed a thousand artifices to
engage me to dinner. The more unpolite I was with people, the more
obstinate they became. I could not refuse everybody. While I made
myself a thousand enemies by my refusals, I was incessantly a slave
to my complaisance, and, in whatever manner I made my
engagements, I had not an hour in a day to myself.
I then perceived it was not so easy to be poor and independent, as
I had imagined. I wished to live by my profession: the public would
not suffer me to do it. A thousand means were thought of to
indemnify me for the time I lost. The next thing would have been
showing myself like Punch, at so much each person. I knew no
dependence more cruel and degrading than this. I saw no other
method of putting an end to it than refusing all kinds of presents,
great and small, let them come from whom they would. This had no
other effect than to increase the number of givers, who wished to
have the honor of overcoming my resistance, and to force me, in
spite of myself, to be under an obligation to them.
Many, who would not have given me half-a-crown had I asked it
from them, incessantly importuned me with their offers, and, in
revenge for my refusal, taxed me with arrogance and ostentation.
It will naturally be conceived that the resolutions I had taken, and
the system I wished to follow, were not agreeable to Madam le
Vasseur. All the disinterestedness of the daughter did not prevent
her from following the directions of her mother; and the governesses,
as Gauffecourt called them, were not always so steady in their

refusals as I was. Although many things were concealed from me, I
perceived so many as were necessary to enable me to judge that I
did not see all, and this tormented me less by the accusation of
connivance, which it was so easy for me to foresee, than by the cruel
idea of never being master in my own apartments, nor even of my
own person. I prayed, conjured, and became angry, all to no
purpose; the mother made me pass for an eternal grumbler, and a
man who was peevish and ungovernable. She held perpetual
whisperings with my friends; everything in my little family was
mysterious and a secret to me; and, that I might not incessantly
expose myself to noisy quarrelling, I no longer dared to take notice of
what passed in it. A firmness of which I was not capable, would have
been necessary to withdraw me from this domestic strife. I knew how
to complain, but not how to act: they suffered me to say what I
pleased, and continued to act as they thought proper.
This constant teasing, and the daily importunities to which I was
subject, rendered the house, and my residence at Paris,
disagreeable to me. When my indisposition permitted me to go out,
and I did not suffer myself to be led by my acquaintance first to one
place and then to another, I took a walk, alone, and reflected on my
grand system, something of which I committed to paper, bound up
between two covers, which, with a pencil, I always had in my pocket.
In this manner, the unforeseen disagreeableness of a situation I had
chosen entirely led me back to literature, to which unsuspectedly I
had recourse as a means of releaving my mind, and thus, in the first
works I wrote, I introduced the peevishness and ill-humor which were
the cause of my undertaking them. There was another circumstance
which contributed not a little to this; thrown into the world despite of
myself, without having the manners of it, or being in a situation to
adopt and conform myself to them, I took it into my head to adopt
others of my own, to enable me to dispense with those of society. My
foolish timidity, which I could not conquer, having for principle the
fear of being wanting in the common forms, I took, by way of
encouraging myself, a resolution to tread them under foot. I became
sour and cynic from shame, and affected to despise the politeness
which I knew not how to practice. This austerity, conformable to my
new principles, I must confess, seemed to ennoble itself in my mind;

it assumed in my eyes the form of the intrepidity of virtue, and I dare
assert it to be upon this noble basis, that it supported itself longer
and better than could have been expected from anything so contrary
to my nature. Yet, not withstanding, I had the name of a
misanthrope, which my exterior appearance and some happy
expressions had given me in the world: it is certain I did not support
the character well in private, that my friends and acquaintance led
this untractable bear about like a lamb, and that, confining my
sarcasms to severe but general truths, I was never capable of saying
an uncivil thing to any person whatsoever.
The 'Devin du Village' brought me completely into vogue, and
presently after there was not a man in Paris whose company was
more sought after than mine. The history of this piece, which is a
kind of era in my life, is joined with that of the connections I had at
that time. I must enter a little into particulars to make what is to follow
the better understood.
I had a numerous acquaintance, yet no more than two friends:
Diderot and Grimm. By an effect of the desire I have ever felt to unite
everything that is dear to me, I was too much a friend to both not to
make them shortly become so to each other. I connected them: they
agreed well together, and shortly become more intimate with each
other than with me. Diderot had a numerous acquaintance, but
Grimm, a stranger and a new-comer, had his to procure, and with the
greatest pleasure I procured him all I could. I had already given him
Diderot. I afterwards brought him acquainted with Gauffecourt. I
introduced him to Madam Chenonceaux, Madam D'Epinay, and the
Baron d'Holbach; with whom I had become connected almost in
spite of myself. All my friends became his: this was natural: but not
one of his ever became mine; which was inclining to the contrary.
Whilst he yet lodged at the house of the Comte de Friese, he
frequently gave us dinners in his apartment, but I never received the
least mark of friendship from the Comte de Friese, Comte de
Schomberg, his relation, very familiar with Grimm, nor from any other
person, man or woman, with whom Grimm, by their means, had any
connection. I except the Abbe Raynal, who, although his friend, gave
proofs of his being mine; and in cases of need, offered me his purse
with a generosity not very common. But I knew the Abbe Raynal long

before Grimm had any acquaintance with him, and had entertained a
great regard for him on account of his delicate and honorable
behavior to me upon a slight occasion, which I shall never forget.
The Abbe Raynal is certainly a warm friend; of this I saw a proof,
much about the time of which I speak, with respect to Grimm himself,
with whom he was very intimate. Grimm, after having been
sometime on a footing of friendship with Mademoiselle Fel, fell
violently in love with her, and wished to supplant Cahusac. The
young lady, piquing herself on her constancy, refused her new
admirer. He took this so much to heart, that the appearance of his
affliction became tragical. He suddenly fell into the strangest state
imaginable. He passed days and nights in a continued lethargy. He
lay with his eyes open; and although his pulse continued to beat
regularly, without speaking eating, or stirring, yet sometimes
seeming to hear what was said to him, but never answering, not
even by a sign, and remaining almost as immovable as if he had
been dead, yet without agitation, pain, or fever. The Abbe Raynal
and myself watched over him; the abbe, more robust, and in better
health than I was, by night, and I by day, without ever both being
absent at one time. The Comte de Friese was alarmed, and brought
to him Senac, who, after having examined the state in which he was,
said there was nothing to apprehend, and took his leave without
giving a prescription. My fears for my friend made me carefully
observe the countenance of the physician, and I perceived him smile
as he went away. However, the patient remained several days
almost motionless, without taking anything except a few preserved
cherries, which from time to time I put upon his tongue, and which he
swallowed without difficulty. At length he, one morning, rose, dressed
himself, and returned to his usual way of life, without either at that
time or afterwards speaking to me or the Abbe Raynal, at least that I
know of, or to any other person, of this singular lethargy, or the care
we had taken of him during the time it lasted.
The affair made a noise, and it would really have been a wonderful
circumstance had the cruelty of an opera girl made a man die of
despair. This strong passion brought Grimm into vogue; he was soon
considered as a prodigy in love, friendship, and attachments of every
kind. Such an opinion made his company sought after, and procured

him a good reception in the first circles; by which means he
separated from me, with whom he was never inclined to associate
when he could do it with anybody else. I perceived him to be on the
point of breaking with me entirely; for the lively and ardent
sentiments, of which he made a parade, were those which with less
noise and pretensions, I had really conceived for him. I was glad he
succeeded in the world; but I did not wish him to do this by forgetting
his friend. I one day said to him: "Grimm, you neglect me, and I
forgive you for it. When the first intoxication of your success is over,
and you begin to perceive a void in your enjoyments, I hope you will
return to your friend, whom you will always find in the same
sentiments; at present do not constrain yourself, I leave you at liberty
to act as you please, and wait your leisure." He said I was right,
made his arrangements in consequence, and shook off all restraint,
so that I saw no more of him except in company with our common
friends.
Our chief rendezvous, before he was connected with Madam
d'Epinay as he afterwards became, was at the house of Baron
d'Holbach. This said baron was the son of a man who had raised
himself from obscurity. His fortune was considerable, and he used it
nobly, receiving at his house men of letters and merit: and, by the
knowledge he himself had acquired, was very worthy of holding a
place amongst them. Having been long attached to Diderot, he
endeavored to become acquainted with me by his means, even
before my name was known to the world. A natural repugnancy
prevented me a long time from answering his advances. One day,
when he asked me the reason of my unwillingness, I told him he was
too rich. He was, however, resolved to carry his point, and at length
succeeded. My greatest misfortune proceeded from my being unable
to resist the force of marked attention. I have ever had reason to
repent of having yielded to it.
Another acquaintance which, as soon as I had any pretensions to
it, was converted into friendship, was that of M. Duclos. I had several
years before seen him, for the first time, at the Chevrette, at the
house of Madam d'Epinay, with whom he was upon very good terms.
On that day we only dined together, and he returned to town in the
afternoon. But we had a conversation of a few moments after dinner.

Madam d'Epinay had mentioned me to him, and my opera of the
'Muses Gallantes'. Duclos, endowed with too great talents not to be
a friend to those in whom the like were found, was prepossessed in
my favor, and invited me to go and see him. Notwithstanding my
former wish, increased by an acquaintance, I was withheld by my
timidity and indolence, as long as I had no other passport to him than
his complaisance. But encouraged by my first success, and by his
eulogiums, which reached my ears, I went to see him; he returned
my visit, and thus began the connection between us, which will ever
render him dear to me. By him, as well as from the testimony of my
own heart, I learned that uprightness and probity may sometimes be
connected with the cultivation of letters.
Many other connections less solid, and which I shall not here
particularize, were the effects of my first success, and lasted until
curiosity was satisfied. I was a man so easily known, that on the next
day nothing new was to be discovered in me. However, a woman,
who at that time was desirous of my acquaintance, became much
more solidly attached to me than any of those whose curiosity I had
excited: this was the Marchioness of Crequi, niece to M. le Bailli de
Froulay, ambassador from Malta, whose brother had preceded M. de
Montaigu in the embassy to Venice, and whom I had gone to see on
my return from that city. Madam de Crequi wrote to me: I visited her:
she received me into her friendship. I sometimes dined with her. I
met at her table several men of letters, amongst others M. Saurin,
the author of Spartacus, Barnevelt, etc., since become my
implacable enemy; for no other reason, at least that I can imagine,
than my bearing the name of a man whom his father has cruelly
persecuted.
It will appear that for a copyist, who ought to be employed in his
business from morning till night, I had many interruptions, which
rendered my days not very lucrative, and prevented me from being
sufficiently attentive to what I did to do it well; for which reason, half
the time I had to myself was lost in erasing errors or beginning my
sheet anew. This daily importunity rendered Paris more
unsupportable, and made me ardently wish to be in the country. I
several times went to pass a few days at Mercoussis, the vicar of
which was known to Madam le Vasseur, and with whom we all

arranged ourselves in such a manner as not to make things
disagreeable to him. Grimm once went thither with us.
[Since I have neglected to relate here a trifling, but
memorable
adventure I had with the said Grimm one day, on which we
were to
dine at the fountain of St. Vandrille, I will let it pass: but
when
I thought of it afterwards, I concluded that he was brooding
in his
heart the conspiracy he has, with so much success, since
carried
into execution.]
The vicar had a tolerable voice, sung well, and, although he did
not read music, learned his part with great facility and precision. We
passed our time in singing the trios I had composed at
Chenonceaux. To these I added two or three new ones, to the words
Grimm and the vicar wrote, well or ill. I cannot refrain from regretting
these trios composed and sung in moments of pure joy, and which I
left at Wootton, with all my music. Mademoiselle Davenport has
perhaps curled her hair with them; but they are worthy of being
preserved, and are, for the most part, of very good counterpoint. It
was after one of these little excursions in which I had the pleasure of
seeing the aunt at her ease and very cheerful, and in which my
spirits were much enlivened, that I wrote to the vicar very rapidly and
very ill, an epistle in verse which will be found amongst my papers.
I had nearer to Paris another station much to my liking with M.
Mussard, my countryman, relation and friend, who at Passy had
made himself a charming retreat, where I have passed some very
peaceful moments. M. Mussard was a jeweller, a man of good
sense, who, after having acquired a genteel fortune, had given his
only daughter in marriage to M. de Valmalette, the son of an
exchange broker, and maitre d'hotel to the king, took the wise
resolution to quit business in his declining years, and to place an
interval of repose and enjoyment between the hurry and the end of

life. The good man Mussard, a real philosopher in practice, lived
without care, in a very pleasant house which he himself had built in a
very pretty garden, laid out with his own hands. In digging the
terraces of this garden he found fossil shells, and in such great
quantities that his lively imagination saw nothing but shells in nature.
He really thought the universe was composed of shells and the
remains of shells, and that the whole earth was only the sand of
these in different stratae. His attention thus constantly engaged with
his singular discoveries, his imagination became so heated with the
ideas they gave him, that, in his head, they would soon have been
converted into a system, that is into folly, if, happily for his reason,
but unfortunately for his friends, to whom he was dear, and to whom
his house was an agreeable asylum, a most cruel and extraordinary
disease had not put an end to his existence. A constantly increasing
tumor in his stomach prevented him from eating, long before the
cause of it was discovered, and, after several years of suffering,
absolutely occasioned him to die of hunger. I can never, without the
greatest affliction of mind, call to my recollection the last moments of
this worthy man, who still received with so much pleasure, Leneips
and myself, the only friends whom the sight of his sufferings did not
separate from him until his last hour, when he was reduced to
devouring with his eyes the repasts he had placed before us,
scarcely having the power of swallowing a few drops of weak tea,
which came up again a moment afterwards. But before these days of
sorrow, how many have I passed at his house, with the chosen
friends he had made himself! At the head of the list I place the Abbe
Prevot, a very amiable man, and very sincere, whose heart vivified
his writings, worthy of immortality, and who, neither in his disposition
nor in society, had the least of the melancholy coloring he gave to his
works. Procope, the physician, a little Esop, a favorite with the
ladies; Boulanger, the celebrated posthumous author of 'Despotisme
Oriental', and who, I am of opinion extended the systems of Mussard
on the duration of the world. The female part of his friends consisted
of Madam Denis, niece to Voltaire, who, at that time, was nothing
more than a good kind of woman, and pretended not to wit: Madam
Vanloo, certainly not handsome, but charming, and who sang like an
angel: Madam de Valmalette, herself, who sang also, and who,

although very thin, would have been very amiable had she had fewer
pretensions. Such, or very nearly such, was the society of M.
Mussard, with which I should had been much pleased, had not his
conchyliomania more engaged my attention; and I can say, with
great truth, that, for upwards of six months, I worked with him in his
cabinet with as much pleasure as he felt himself.
He had long insisted upon the virtue of the waters of Passy, that
they were proper in my case, and recommended me to come to his
house to drink them. To withdraw myself from the tumult of the city, I
at length consented, and went to pass eight or ten days at Passy,
which, on account of my being in the country, were of more service
to me than the waters I drank during my stay there. Mussard played
the violincello, and was passionately found of Italian music. This was
the subject of a long conversation we had one evening after supper,
particularly the 'opera-buffe' we had both seen in Italy, and with
which we were highly delighted. My sleep having forsaken me in the
night, I considered in what manner it would be possible to give in
France an idea of this kind of drama. The 'Amours de Ragonde' did
not in the least resemble it. In the morning, whilst I took my walk and
drank the waters, I hastily threw together a few couplets to which I
adapted such airs as occurred to me at the moments. I scribbled
over what I had composed, in a kind of vaulted saloon at the end of
the garden, and at tea. I could not refrain from showing the airs to
Mussard and to Mademoiselle du Vernois, his 'gouvernante', who
was a very good and amiable girl. Three pieces of composition I had
sketched out were the first monologue: 'J'ai perdu mon serviteur;'-the air of the Devin; 'L'amour croit s'il s'inquiete;' and the last duo: 'A
jamais, Colin, je t'engage, etc.' I was so far from thinking it worth
while to continue what I had begun, that, had it not been for the
applause and encouragement I received from both Mussard and
Mademoiselle, I should have throw n my papers into the fire and
thought no more of their contents, as I had frequently done by things
of much the same merit; but I was so animated by the encomiums I
received, that in six days, my drama, excepting a few couplets, was
written. The music also was so far sketched out, that all I had further
to do to it after my return from Paris, was to compose a little of the
recitative, and to add the middle parts, the whole of which I finished

with so much rapidity, that in three weeks my work was ready for
representation. The only thing now wanting, was the divertissement,
which was not composed until a long time afterwards.
My imagination was so warmed by the composition of this work
that I had the strongest desire to hear it performed, and would have
given anything to have seen and heard the whole in the manner I
should have chosen, which would have been that of Lully, who is
said to have had 'Armide' performed for himself only. As it was not
possible I should hear the performance unaccompanied by the
public, I could not see the effect of my piece without getting it
received at the opera. Unfortunately it was quite a new species of
composition, to which the ears of the public were not accustomed;
and besides the ill success of the 'Muses Gallantes' gave too much
reason to fear for the Devin, if I presented it in my own name. Duclos
relieved me from this difficulty, and engaged to get the piece
rehearsed without mentioning the author. That I might not discover
myself, I did not go to the rehearsal, and the 'Petits violons', by
whom it was directed, knew not who the author was until after a
general plaudit had borne the testimony of the work.
[Rebel and Frauneur, who, when they were very young,
went together
from house to house playing on the violin, were so called.]
Everybody present was so delighted with it, that, on the next day,
nothing else was spoken of in the different companies. M. de Cury,
Intendant des Menus, who was present at the rehearsal, demanded
the piece to have it performed at court. Duclos, who knew my
intentions, and thought I should be less master of my work at the
court than at Paris, refused to give it. Cury claimed it authoratively.
Duclos persisted in his refusal, and the dispute between them was
carried to such a length, that one day they would have gone out from
the opera-house together had they not been separated. M. de Cury
applied to me, and I referred him to Duclos. This made it necessary
to return to the latter. The Duke d'Aumont interfered; and at length
Duclos thought proper to yield to authority, and the piece was given
to be played at Fontainebleau.

The part to which I had been most attentive, and in which I had
kept at the greatest distance from the common track, was the
recitative. Mine was accented in a manner entirely new, and
accompanied the utterance of the word. The directors dared not
suffer this horrid innovation to pass, lest it should shock the ears of
persons who never judge for themselves. Another recitative was
proposed by Francueil and Jelyotte, to which I consented; but
refused at the same time to have anything to do with it myself.
When everything was ready and the day of performance fixed, a
proposition was made me to go to Fontainebleau, that I might at
least be at the last rehearsal. I went with Mademoiselle Fel, Grimm,
and I think the Abbe Raynal, in one of the stages to the court. The
rehearsal was tolerable: I was more satisfied with it than I expected
to have been. The orchestra was numerous, composed of the
orchestras of the opera and the king's band. Jelyotte played Colin,
Mademoiselle Fel, Colette, Cuvillier the Devin: the choruses were
those of the opera. I said but little; Jelyotte had prepared everything;
I was unwilling either to approve of or censure what he had done;
and notwithstanding I had assumed the air of an old Roman, I was,
in the midst of so many people, as bashful as a schoolboy.
The next morning, the day of performance, I went to breakfast at
the coffee-house 'du grand commun', where I found a great number
of people. The rehearsal of the preceding evening, and the difficulty
of getting into the theatre, were the subjects of conversation. An
officer present said he entered with the greatest ease, gave a long
account of what had passed, described the author, and related what
he had said and done; but what astonished me most in this long
narrative, given with as much assurance as simplicity, was that it did
not contain a syllable of truth. It was clear to me that he who spoke
so positively of the rehearsal had not been at it, because, without
knowing him, he had before his eyes that author whom he said he
had seen and examined so minutely. However, what was more
singular still in this scene, was its effect upon me. The officer was a
man rather in years, he had nothing of the appearance of a
coxcomb; his features appeared to announce a man of merit; and his
cross of Saint Louis, an officer of long standing. He interested me:
notwithstanding his impudence. Whilst he uttered his lies, I blushed,

looked down, and was upon thorns; I, for some time, endeavored
within myself to find the means of believing him to be in an
involuntary error. At length, trembling lest some person should know
me, and by this means confound him, I hastily drank my chocolate,
without saying a word, and, holding down my head, I passed before
him, got out of the coffee-house as soon as possible, whilst the
company were making their remarks upon the relation that had been
given. I was no sooner in the street than I was in a perspiration, and
had anybody known and named me before I left the room, I am
certain all the shame and embarrassment of a guilty person would
have appeared in my countenance, proceeding from what I felt the
poor man would have had to have suffered had his lie been
discovered.
I come to one of the critical moments of my life, in which it is
difficult to do anything more than to relate, because it is almost
impossible that even narrative should not carry with it the marks of
censure or apology. I will, however, endeavor to relate how and upon
what motives I acted, with out adding either approbation or censure.
I was on that day in the same careless undress as usual, with a
long beard and wig badly combed. Considering this want of decency
as an act of courage, I entered the theatre wherein the king, queen,
the royal family, and the whole court were to enter immediately after.
I was conducted to a box by M. de Cury, and which belonged to him.
It was very spacious, upon the stage and opposite to a lesser, but
more elevated one, in which the king sat with Madam de
Pompadour.
As I was surrounded by women, and the only man in front of the
box, I had no doubt of my having been placed there purposely to be
exposed to view. As soon as the theatre was lighted up, finding I was
in the midst of people all extremely well dressed, I began to be less
at my ease, and asked myself if I was in my place? whether or not I
was properly dressed? After a few minutes of inquietude: "Yes,"
replied I, with an intrepidity which perhaps proceeded more from the
impossibility of retracting than the force of all my reasoning, "I am in
my place, because I am going to see my own piece performed, to
which I have been invited, for which reason only I am come here;
and after all, no person has a greater right than I have to reap the

fruit of my labor and talents; I am dressed as usual, neither better
nor worse; and if I once begin to subject myself to public opinion, I
shall shortly become a slave to it in everything. To be always
consistent with myself, I ought not to blush, in any place whatever, at
being dressed in a manner suitable to the state I have chosen. My
exterior appearance is simple, but neither dirty nor slovenly; nor is a
beard either of these in itself, because it is given us by nature, and
according to time, place and custom, is sometimes an ornament.
People think I am ridiculous, nay, even absurd; but what signifies this
to me? I ought to know how to bear censure and ridicule, provided I
do not deserve them." After this little soliloquy I became so firm that,
had it been necessary, I could have been intrepid. But whether it was
the effect of the presence of his majesty, or the natural disposition of
those about me, I perceived nothing but what was civil and obliging
in the curiosity of which I was the object. This so much affected me
that I began to be uneasy for myself, and the fate of my piece;
fearing I should efface the favorable prejudices which seemed to
lead to nothing but applause. I was armed against raillery; but, so far
overcome, by the flattering and obliging treatment I had not
expected, that I trembled like a child when the performance was
begun.
I had soon sufficient reason to be encouraged. The piece was very
ill played with respect to the actors, but the musical part was well
sung and executed. During the first scene, which was really of a
delightful simplicity, I heard in the boxes a murmur of surprise and
applause, which, relative to pieces of the same kind, had never yet
happened. The fermentation was soon increased to such a degree
as to be perceptible through the whole audience, and of which, to
speak--after the manner of Montesquieu--the effect was augmented
by itself. In the scene between the two good little folks, this effect
was complete. There is no clapping of hands before the king;
therefore everything was heard, which was advantageous to the
author and the piece. I heard about me a whispering of women, who
appeared as beautiful as angels. They said to each other in a low
voice: "This is charming: That is ravishing: There is not a sound
which does not go to the heart." The pleasure of giving this emotion
to so many amiable persons moved me to tears; and these I could

not contain in the first duo, when I remarked that I was not the only
person who wept. I collected myself for a moment, on recollecting
the concert of M. de Treitorens. This reminiscence had the effect of
the slave who held the crown over the head of the general who
triumphed, but my reflection was short, and I soon abandoned
myself without interruption to the pleasure of enjoying my success.
However, I am certain the voluptuousness of the sex was more
predominant than the vanity of the author, and had none but men
been present, I certainly should not have had the incessant desire I
felt of catching on my lips the delicious tears I had caused to flow. I
have known pieces excite more lively admiration, but I never saw so
complete, delightful, and affecting an intoxication of the senses
reign, during a whole representation, especially at court, and at a
first performance. They who saw this must recollect it, for it has
never yet been equalled.
The same evening the Duke d' Aumont sent to desire me to be at
the palace the next day at eleven o'clock, when he would present me
to the king. M. de Cury, who delivered me the message, added that
he thought a pension was intended, and that his majesty wished to
announce it to me himself. Will it be believed that the night of so
brilliant a day was for me a night of anguish and perplexity? My first
idea, after that of being presented, was that of my frequently wanting
to retire; this had made me suffer very considerably at the theatre,
and might torment me the next day when I should be in the gallery,
or in the king's apartment, amongst all the great, waiting for the
passing of his majesty. My infirmity was the principal cause which
prevented me from mixing in polite companies, and enjoying the
conversation of the fair. The idea alone of the situation in which this
want might place me, was sufficient to produce it to such a degree
as to make me faint away, or to recur to means to which, in my
opinion, death was much preferable. None but persons who are
acquainted with this situation can judge of the horror which being
exposed to the risk of it inspires.
I then supposed myself before the king, presented to his majesty,
who deigned to stop and speak to me. In this situation, justness of
expression and presence of mind were peculiarly necessary in
answering. Would my timidity which disconcerts me in presence of

any stranger whatever, have been shaken off in presence of the King
of France; or would it have suffered me instantly to make choice of
proper expressions? I wished, without laying aside the austere
manner I had adopted, to show myself sensible of the honor done
me by so great a monarch, and in a handsome and merited
eulogium to convey some great and useful truth. I could not prepare
a suitable answer without exactly knowing what his majesty was to
say to me; and had this been the case, I was certain that, in his
presence, I should not recollect a word of what I had previously
meditated. "What," said I, "will become of me in this moment, and
before the whole court, if, in my confusion, any of my stupid
expressions should escape me?" This danger alarmed and terrified
me. I trembled to such a degree that at all events I was determined
not to expose myself to it.
I lost, it is true, the pension which in some measure was offered
me; but I at the same time exempted myself from the yoke it would
have imposed. Adieu, truth, liberty, and courage! How should I
afterwards have dared to speak of disinterestedness and
independence? Had I received the pension I must either have
become a flatterer or remained silent; and, moreover, who would
have insured to me the payment of it! What steps should I have been
under the necessity of taking! How many people must I have
solicited! I should have had more trouble and anxious cares in
preserving than in doing without it. Therefore, I thought I acted
according to my principles by refusing, and sacrificing appearances
to reality. I communicated my resolution to Grimm, who said nothing
against it. To others I alleged my ill state of health, and left the court
in the morning.
My departure made some noise, and was generally condemned.
My reasons could not be known to everybody, it was therefore easy
to accuse me of foolish pride, and thus not irritate the jealousy of
such as felt they would not have acted as I had done. The next day
Jelyotte wrote me a note, in which he stated the success of my
piece, and the pleasure it had afforded the king. "All day long," said
he, "his majesty sings, with the worst voice in his kingdom: 'J'ai
perdu mon serviteur: J'ai perdu tout mon bonheur.'" He likewise
added, that in a fortnight the Devin was to be performed a second

time; which confirmed in the eyes of the public the complete success
of the first.
Two days afterwards, about nine o'clock in the evening, as I was
going to sup with Madam D'Epinay, I perceived a hackney-coach
pass by the door. Somebody within made a sign to me to approach. I
did so, and got into it, and found the person to be Diderot. He spoke
of the pension with more warmth than, upon such a subject, I should
have expected from a philosopher. He did not blame me for having
been unwilling to be presented to the king, but severely reproached
me with my indifference about the pension. He observed that
although on my own account I might be disinterested, I ought not to
be so on that of Madam Vasseur and her daughter; that it was my
duty to seize every means of providing for their subsistence; and that
as, after all, it could not be said I had refused the pension, he
maintained I ought, since the king seemed disposed to grant it to me,
to solicit and obtain it by one means or another. Although I was
obliged to him for his good wishes, I could not relish his maxims,
which produced a warm dispute, the first I ever had with him. All our
disputes were of this kind, he prescribing to me what he pretended I
ought to do, and I defending myself because I was of a different
opinion.
It was late when we parted. I would have taken him to supper at
Madam d' Epinay's, but he refused to go; and, notwithstanding all the
efforts which at different times the desire of uniting those I love
induced me to make, to prevail upon him to see her, even that of
conducting her to his door which he kept shut against us, he
constantly refused to do it, and never spoke of her but with the
utmost contempt. It was not until after I had quarrelled with both that
they became acquainted and that he began to speak honorably of
her.
From this time Diderot and Grimm seemed to have undertaken to
alienate from me the governesses, by giving them to understand that
if they were not in easy circumstances the fault was my own, and
that they never would be so with me. They endeavored to prevail on
them to leave me, promising them the privilege for retailing salt, a
snuff shop, and I know not what other advantages by means of the
influence of Madam d' Epinay. They likewise wished to gain over

Duclos and d'Holback, but the former constantly refused their
proposals. I had at the time some intimation of what was going
forward, but I was not fully acquainted with the whole until long
afterwards; and I frequently had reason to lament the effects of the
blind and indiscreet zeal of my friends, who, in my ill state of health,
striving to reduce me to the most melancholy solitude, endeavored,
as they imagined, to render me happy by the means which, of all
others, were the most proper to make me miserable.
In the carnival following the conclusion of the year
, the Devin
was performed at Paris, and in this interval I had sufficient time to
compose the overture and divertissement. This divertissement, such
as it stands engraved, was to be in action from the beginning to the
end, and in a continued subject, which in my opinion, afforded very
agreeable representations. But when I proposed this idea at the
opera-house, nobody would so much as hearken to me, and I was
obliged to tack together music and dances in the usual manner: on
this account the divertissement, although full of charming ideas
which do not diminish the beauty of scenes, succeeded but very
middlingly. I suppressed the recitative of Jelyotte, and substituted my
own, such as I had first composed it, and as it is now engraved; and
this recitative a little after the French manner, I confess, drawled out,
instead of pronounced by the actors, far from shocking the ears of
any person, equally succeeded with the airs, and seemed in the
judgment of the public to possess as much musical merit. I dedicated
my piece to Duclos, who had given it his protection, and declared it
should be my only dedication. I have, however, with his consent,
written a second; but he must have thought himself more honored by
the exception, than if I had not written a dedication to any person.
I could relate many anecdotes concerning this piece, but things of
greater importance prevent me from entering into a detail of them at
present. I shall perhaps resume the subject in a supplement. There
is however one which I cannot omit, as it relates to the greater part
of what is to follow. I one day examined the music of D'Holbach, in
his closet. After having looked over many different kinds, he said,
showing me a collection of pieces for the harpsichord: "These were
composed for me; they are full of taste and harmony, and unknown
to everybody but myself. You ought to make a selection from them

for your divertissement." Having in my head more subjects of airs
and symphonies than I could make use of, I was not the least
anxious to have any of his. However, he pressed me so much, that,
from a motive of complaisance, I chose a Pastoral, which I abridged
and converted into a trio, for the entry of the companions of Colette.
Some months afterwards, and whilst the Devin still continued to be
performed, going into Grimms I found several people about his
harpsichord, whence he hastily rose on my arrival. As I accidently
looked toward his music stand, I there saw the same collection of the
Baron d'Holback, opened precisely at the piece he had prevailed
upon me to take, assuring me at the same time that it should never
go out of his hands. Some time afterwards, I again saw the collection
open on the harpischord of M. d'Papinay, one day when he gave a
little concert. Neither Grimm, nor anybody else, ever spoke to me of
the air, and my reason for mentioning it here is that some time
afterwards, a rumor was spread that I was not the author of Devin.
As I never made a great progress in the practical part, I am
persuaded that had it not been for my dictionary of music, it would in
the end have been said I did not understand composition.
Sometime before the 'Devin du Village' was performed, a company
of Italian Bouffons had arrived at Paris, and were ordered to perform
at the opera-house, without the effect they would produce there
being foreseen. Although they were detestable, and the orchestra, at
that time very ignorant, mutilated at will the pieces they gave, they
did the French opera an injury that will never be repaired. The
comparison of these two kinds of music, heard the same evening in
the same theatre, opened the ears of the French; nobody could
endure their languid music after the marked and lively accents of
Italian composition; and the moment the Bouffons had done,
everybody went away. The managers were obliged to change the
order of representation, and let the performance of the Bouffons be
the last. 'Egle Pigmalion' and 'le Sylphe' were successively given:
nothing could bear the comparison. The 'Devin du Village' was the
only piece that did it, and this was still relished after 'la Serva
Padroma'. When I composed my interlude, my head was filled with
these pieces, and they gave me the first idea of it: I was, however,
far from imagining they would one day be passed in review by the

side of my composition. Had I been a plagiarist, how many pilferings
would have been manifest, and what care would have been taken to
point them out to the public! But I had done nothing of the kind. All
attempts to discover any such thing were fruitless: nothing was found
in my music which led to the recollection of that of any other person;
and my whole composition compared with the pretended original,
was found to be as new as the musical characters I had invented.
Had Mondonville or Rameau undergone the same ordeal, they would
have lost much of their substance.
The Bouffons acquired for Italian music very warm partisans. All
Paris was divided into two parties, the violence of which was greater
than if an affair of state or religion had been in question. One of
them, the most powerful and numerous, composed of the great, of
men of fortune, and the ladies, supported French music; the other,
more lively and haughty, and fuller of enthusiasm, was composed of
real connoisseurs, and men of talents, and genius. This little group
assembled at the opera-house, under the box belonging to the
queen. The other party filled up the rest of the pit and the theatre; but
the heads were mostly assembled under the box of his majesty.
Hence the party names of Coin du Roi, Coin de la Reine,--[King's
corner,--Queen's corner.]--then in great celebrity. The dispute, as it
became more animated, produced several pamphlets. The king's
corner aimed at pleasantry; it was laughed at by the 'Petit Prophete'.
It attempted to reason; the 'Lettre sur la Musique Francoise' refuted
its reasoning. These two little productions, the former of which was
by Grimm, the latter by myself, are the only ones which have outlived
the quarrel; all the rest are long since forgotten.
But the Petit Prophete, which, notwithstanding all I could say, was
for a long time attributed to me, was considered as a pleasantry, and
did not produce the least inconvenience to the author: whereas the
letter on music was taken seriously, and incensed against me the
whole nation, which thought itself offended by this attack on its
music. The description of the incredible effect of this pamphlet would
be worthy of the pen of Tacitus. The great quarrel between the
parliament and the clergy was then at its height. The parliament had
just been exiled; the fermentation was general; everything
announced an approaching insurrection. The pamphlet appeared:

from that moment every other quarrel was forgotten; the perilous
state of French music was the only thing by which the attention of
the public was engaged, and the only insurrection was against
myself. This was so general that it has never since been totally
calmed. At court, the bastile or banishment was absolutely
determined on, and a 'lettre de cachet' would have been issued had
not M. de Voyer set forth in the most forcible manner that such a
step would be ridiculous. Were I to say this pamphlet probably
prevented a revolution, the reader would imagine I was in a dream. It
is, however, a fact, the truth of which all Paris can attest, it being no
more than fifteen years since the date of this singular fact. Although
no attempts were made on my liberty, I suffered numerous insults;
and even my life was in danger. The musicians of the opera
orchestra humanely resolved to murder me as I went out of the
theatre. Of this I received information; but the only effect it produced
on me was to make me more assiduously attend the opera; and I did
not learn, until a considerable time afterwards, that M. Ancelot,
officer in the mousquetaires, and who had a friendship for me, had
prevented the effect of this conspiracy by giving me an escort, which,
unknown to myself, accompanied me until I was out of danger. The
direction of the opera-house had just been given to the hotel de ville.
The first exploit performed by the Prevot des Marchands, was to take
from me my freedom of the theatre, and this in the most uncivil
manner possible. Admission was publicly refused me on my
presenting myself, so that I was obliged to take a ticket that I might
not that evening have the mortification to return as I had come. This
injustice was the more shameful, as the only price I had set on my
piece when I gave it to the managers was a perpetual freedom of the
house; for although this was a right, common to every author, and
which I enjoyed under a double title, I expressly stipulated for it in
presence of M. Duclos. It is true, the treasurer brought me fifty louis,
for which I had not asked; but, besides the smallness of the sum,
compared with that which, according to the rule, established in such
cases, was due to me, this payment had nothing in common with the
right of entry formerly granted, and which was entirely independent
of it. There was in this behavior such a complication of iniquity and
brutality, that the public, notwithstanding its animosity against me,

which was then at its highest, was universally shocked at it, and
many persons who insulted me the preceding evening, the next day
exclaimed in the open theatre, that it was shameful thus to deprive
an author of his right of entry; and particularly one who had so well
deserved it, and was entitled to claim it for himself and another
person. So true is the Italian proverb: Ogn' un ama la giustizia in
cosa d altrui.--[Every one loves justice in the affairs of another.]
In this situation the only thing I had to do was to demand my work,
since the price I had agreed to receive for it was refused me. For this
purpose I wrote to M. d'Argenson, who had the department of the
opera. I likewise enclosed to him a memoir which was
unanswerable; but this, as well as my letter, was ineffectual, and I
received no answer to either. The silence of that unjust man hurt me
extremely, and did not contribute to increase the very moderate good
opinion I always had of his character and abilities. It was in this
manner the managers kept my piece while they deprived me of that
for which I had given it them. From the weak to the strong, such an
act would be a theft: from the strong to the weak, it is nothing more
than an appropriation of property, without a right.
With respect to the pecuniary advantages of the work, although it
did not produce me a fourth part of the sum it would have done to
any other. person, they were considerable enough to enable me to
subsist several years, and to make amends for the ill success of
copying, which went on but very slowly. I received a hundred louis
from the king; fifty from Madam de Pompadour, for the performance
at Bellevue, where she herself played the part of Colin; fifty from the
opera; and five hundred livres from Pissot, for the engraving; so that
this interlude, which cost me no more than five or six weeks'
application, produced, notwithstanding the ill treatment I received
from the managers and my stupidity at court, almost as much money
as my 'Emilius', which had cost me twenty years' meditation, and
three years' labor. But I paid dearly for the pecuniary ease I received
from the piece, by the infinite vexations it brought upon me. It was
the germ of the secret jealousies which did not appear until a long
time afterwards. After its success I did not remark, either in Grimm,
Diderot, or any of the men of letters, with whom I was acquainted,
the same cordiality and frankness, nor that pleasure in seeing me, I

had previously experienced. The moment I appeared at the baron's,
the conversation was no longer general; the company divided into
small parties; whispered into each other's ears; and I remained
alone, without knowing to whom to address myself. I endured for a
long time this mortifying neglect; and, perceiving that Madam
d'Holbach, who was mild and amiable, still received me well, I bore
with the vulgarity of her husband as long as it was possible. But he
one day attacked me without reason or pretence, and with such
brutality, in presence of Diderot, who said not a word, and Margency,
who since that time has often told me how much he admired the
moderation and mildness of my answers, that, at length driven from
his house, by this unworthy treatment, I took leave with a resolution
never to enter it again. This did not, however, prevent me from
speaking honorably of him and his house, whilst he continually
expressed himself relative to me in the most insulting terms, calling
me that 'petit cuistre': the little college pedant, or servitor in a college,
without, however, being able to charge me with having done either to
himself or any person to whom he was attached the most trifling
injury. In this manner he verified my fears and predictions, I am of
opinion my pretended friends would have pardoned me for having
written books, and even excellent ones, because this merit was not
foreign to themselves; but that they could not forgive my writing an
opera, nor the brilliant success it had; because there was not one
amongst them capable of the same, nor in a situation to aspire to like
honors. Duclos, the only person superior to jealousy, seemed to
become more attached to me: he introduced me to Mademoiselle
Quinault, in whose house I received polite attention, and civility to as
great an extreme, as I had found a want of it in that of M. d'Holbach.
Whilst the performance of the 'Devin du Village' was continued at
the opera-house, the author of it had an advantageous negotiation
with the managers of the French comedy. Not having, during seven
or eight years, been able to get my 'Narcissis' performed at the
Italian theatre, I had, by the bad performance in French of the actors,
become disgusted with it, and should rather have had my piece
received at the French theatre than by them. I mentioned this to La
None, the comedian, with whom I had become acquainted, and who,
as everybody knows, was a man of merit and an author. He was

pleased with the piece, and promised to get it performed without
suffering the name of the author to be known; and in the meantime
procured me the freedom of the theatre, which was extremely
agreeable to me, for I always preferred it to the two others. The
piece was favorably received, and without the author's name being
mentioned; but I have reason to believe it was known to the actors
and actresses, and many other persons. Mademoiselles Gauffin and
Grandval played the amorous parts; and although the whole
performance was, in my opinion, injudicious, the piece could not be
said to be absolutely ill played. The indulgence of the public, for
which I felt gratitude, surprised me; the audience had the patience to
listen to it from the beginning to the end, and to permit a second
representation without showing the least sign of disapprobation. For
my part, I was so wearied with the first, that I could not hold out to
the end; and the moment I left the theatre, I went into the Cafe de
Procope, where I found Boissi, and others of my acquaintance, who
had probably been as much fatigued as myself. I there humbly or
haughtily avowed myself the author of the piece, judging it as
everybody else had done. This public avowal of an author of a piece
which had not succeeded, was much admired, and was by no means
painful to myself. My self-love was flattered by the courage with
which I made it: and I am of opinion, that, on this occasion, there
was more pride in speaking, than there would have been foolish
shame in being silent. However, as it was certain the piece, although
insipid in the performance would bear to be read, I had it printed: and
in the preface, which is one of the best things I ever wrote, I began to
make my principles more public than I had before done.
I soon had an opportunity to explain them entirely in a work of the
greatest importance: for it was, I think, this year,
, that the
programma of the Academy of Dijon upon the 'Origin of the
Inequality of Mankind' made its appearance. Struck with this great
question, I was surprised the academy had dared to propose it: but
since it had shown sufficient courage to do it, I thought I might
venture to treat it, and immediately undertook the discussion.
That I might consider this grand subject more at my ease, I went to
St. Germain for seven or eight days with Theresa, our hostess, who
was a good kind of woman, and one of her friends. I consider this

walk as one of the most agreeable ones I ever took. The weather
was very fine. These good women took upon themselves all the care
and expense. Theresa amused herself with them; and I, free from all
domestic concerns, diverted myself, without restraint, at the hours of
dinner and supper. All the rest of the day wandering in the forest, I
sought for and found there the image of the primitive ages of which I
boldly traced the history. I confounded the pitiful lies of men; I dared
to unveil their nature; to follow the progress of time, and the things
by which it has been disfigured; and comparing the man of art with
the natural man, to show them, in their pretended improvement, the
real source of all their misery. My mind, elevated by these
contemplations, ascended to the Divinity, and thence, seeing my
fellow creatures follow in the blind track of their prejudices that of
their errors and misfortunes, I cried out to them, in a feeble voice,
which they could not hear: "Madmen! know that all your evils
proceed from yourselves!"
From these meditations resulted the discourse on Inequality, a
work more to the taste of Diderot than any of my other writings, and
in which his advice was of the greatest service to me.
[At the time I wrote this, I had not the least suspicion of the
grand conspiracy of Diderot and Grimm. otherwise I should
easily.
have discovered how much the former abused my confidence,
by giving
to my writings that severity and melancholy which were not to be
found in them from the moments he ceased to direct me. The
passage
of the philosopher, who argues with himself, and stops his ears
against the complaints of a man in distress, is after his manner:
and he gave me others still more extraordinary; which I could
never
resolve to make use of. But, attributing, this melancholy to that
he had acquired in the dungeon of Vincennes, and of which
there is a
very sufficient dose in his Clairoal, I never once suspected the
least unfriendly dealing. ]

It was, however, understood but by few readers, and not one of
these would ever speak of it. I had written it to become a competitor
for the premium, and sent it away fully persuaded it would not obtain
it; well convinced it was not for productions of this nature that
academies were founded.
This excursion and this occupation enlivened my spirits and was of
service to my health. Several years before, tormented by my
disorder, I had entirely given myself up to the care of physicians,
who, without alleviating my sufferings, exhausted my strength and
destroyed my constitution. At my return from St. Germain, I found
myself stronger and perceived my health to be improved. I followed
this indication, and determined to cure myself or die without the aid
of physicians and medicine. I bade them forever adieu, and lived
from day to day, keeping close when I found myself indisposed, and
going abroad the moment I had sufficient strength to do it. The
manner of living in Paris amidst people of pretensions was so little to
my liking; the cabals of men of letters, their little candor in their
writings, and the air of importance they gave themselves in the
world, were so odious to me; I found so little mildness, openness of
heart and frankness in the intercourse even of my friends; that,
disgusted with this life of tumult, I began ardently to wish to reside in
the country, and not perceiving that my occupation permitted me to
do it, I went to pass there all the time I had to spare. For several
months I went after dinner to walk alone in the Bois de Boulogne,
meditating on subjects for future works, and not returning until
evening.
Gauffecourt, with whom I was at that time extremely intimate,
being on account of his employment obliged to go to Geneva,
proposed to me the journey, to which I consented. The state of my
health was such as to require the care of the governess; it was
therefore decided she should accompany us, and that her mother
should remain in the house. After thus having made our
arrangements, we set off on the first of June,
.
This was the period when at the age of forty-two, I for the first time
in my life felt a diminution of my natural confidence to which I had
abandoned myself without reserve or inconvenience. We had a
private carriage, in which with the same horses we travelled very

slowly. I frequently got out and walked. We had scarcely performed
half our journey when Theresa showed the greatest uneasiness at
being left in the carriage with Gauffecourt, and when,
notwithstanding her remonstrances, I would get out as usual, she
insisted upon doing the same, and walking with me. I chid her for this
caprice, and so strongly opposed it, that at length she found herself
obliged to declare to me the cause whence it proceeded. I thought I
was in a dream; my astonishment was beyond expression, when I
learned that my friend M. de Gauffecourt, upwards of sixty years of
age, crippled by the gout, impotent and exhausted by pleasures,
had, since our departure, incessantly endeavored to corrupt a
person who belonged to his friend, and was no longer young nor
handsome, by the most base and shameful means, such as
presenting to her a purse, attempting to inflame her imagination by
the reading of an abominable book, and by the sight of infamous
figures, with which it was filled. Theresa, full of indignation, once
threw his scandalous book out of the carriage; and I learned that on
the first evening of our journey, a violent headache having obliged
me to retire to bed before supper, he had employed the whole time
of this tete-a-tete in actions more worthy of a satyr than a man of
worth and honor, to whom I thought I had intrusted my companion
and myself. What astonishment and grief of heart for me! I, who until
then had believed friendship to be inseparable from every amiable
and noble sentiment which constitutes all its charm, for the first time
in my life found myself under the necessity of connecting it with
disdain, and of withdrawing my confidence from a man for whom I
had an affection, and by whom I imagined myself beloved! The
wretch concealed from me his turpitude; and that I might not expose
Theresa, I was obliged to conceal from him my contempt, and
secretly to harbor in my heart such sentiments as were foreign to its
nature. Sweet and sacred illusion of friendship! Gauffecourt first took
the veil from before my eyes. What cruel hands have since that time
prevented it from again being drawn over them!
At Lyons I quitted Gauffecourt to take the road to Savoy, being
unable to be so near to mamma without seeing her. I saw her--Good
God, in what a situation! How contemptible! What remained to her of
primitive virtue? Was it the same Madam de Warrens, formerly so

gay and lively, to whom the vicar of Pontverre had given me
recommendations? How my heart was wounded! The only resource I
saw for her was to quit the country. I earnestly but vainly repeated
the invitation I had several times given her in my letters to come and
live peacefully with me, assuring her I would dedicate the rest of my
life, and that of Theresa, to render her happy. Attached to her
pension, from which, although it was regularly paid, she had not for a
long time received the least advantage, my offers were lost upon her.
I again gave her a trifling part of the contents of my purse, much less
than I ought to have done, and considerably less than I should have
offered her had not I been certain of its not being of the least service
to herself. During my residence at Geneva, she made a journey into
Chablais, and came to see me at Grange-canal. She was in want of
money to continue her journey: what I had in my pocket was
insufficient to this purpose, but an hour afterwards I sent it her by
Theresa. Poor mamma! I must relate this proof of the goodness of
her heart. A little diamond ring was the last jewel she had left. She
took it from her finger, to put it upon that of Theresa, who instantly
replaced it upon that whence it had been taken, kissing the generous
hand which she bathed with her tears. Ah! this was the proper
moment to discharge my debt! I should have abandoned everything
to follow her, and share her fate: let it be what it would. I did nothing
of the kind. My attention was engaged by another attachment, and I
perceived the attachment I had to her was abated by the slender
hopes there were of rendering it useful to either of us. I sighed after
her, my heart was grieved at her situation, but I did not follow her. Of
all the remorse I felt this was the strongest and most lasting. I
merited the terrible chastisement with which I have since that time
incessantly been overwhelmed: may this have expiated my
ingratitude! Of this I appear guilty in my conduct, but my heart has
been too much distressed by what I did ever to have been that of an
ungrateful man.
Before my departure from Paris I had sketched out the dedication
of my discourse on the 'Inequality of Mankind'. I finished it at
Chambery, and dated it from that place, thinking that, to avoid all
chicane, it was better not to date it either from France or Geneva.
The moment I arrived in that city I abandoned myself to the

republican enthusiasm which had brought me to it. This was
augmented by the reception I there met with. Kindly treated by
persons of every description, I entirely gave myself up to a patriotic
zeal, and mortified at being excluded from the rights of a citizen by
the possession of a religion different from that of my forefathers, I
resolved openly to return to the latter. I thought the gospel being the
same for every Christian, and the only difference in religious
opinions the result of the explanations given by men to that which
they did not understand, it was the exclusive right of the sovereign
power in every country to fix the mode of worship, and these
unintelligible opinions; and that consequently it was the duty of a
citizen to admit the one, and conform to the other in the manner
prescribed by the law. The conversation of the encyclopaedists, far
from staggering my faith, gave it new strength by my natural
aversion to disputes and party. The study of man and the universe
had everywhere shown me the final causes and the wisdom by
which they were directed. The reading of the Bible, and especially
that of the New Testament, to which I had for several years past
applied myself, had given me a sovereign contempt for the base and
stupid interpretations given to the words of Jesus Christ by persons
the least worthy of understanding his divine doctrine. In a word,
philosophy, while it attached me to the essential part of religion, had
detached me from the trash of the little formularies with which men
had rendered it obscure. Judging that for a reasonable man there
were not two ways of being a Christian, I was also of opinion that in
each country everything relative to form and discipline was within the
jurisdiction of the laws. From this principle, so social and pacific, and
which has brought upon me such cruel persecutions, it followed that,
if I wished to be a citizen of Geneva, I must become a Protestant,
and conform to the mode of worship established in my country. This I
resolved upon; I moreover put myself under the instructions of the
pastor of the parish in which I lived, and which was without the city.
All I desired was not to appear at the consistory. However, the
ecclesiastical edict was expressly to that effect; but it was agreed
upon to dispense with it in my favor, and a commission of five or six
members was named to receive my profession of faith.
Unfortunately, the minister Perdriau, a mild and an amiable man,

took it into his head to tell me the members were rejoiced at the
thoughts of hearing me speak in the little assembly. This expectation
alarmed me to such a degree that having night and day during three
weeks studied a little discourse I had prepared, I was so confused
when I ought to have pronounced it that I could not utter a single
word, and during the conference I had the appearance of the most
stupid schoolboy. The persons deputed spoke for me, and I
answered yes and no, like a blockhead; I was afterwards admitted to
the communion, and reinstated in my rights as a citizen. I was
enrolled as such in the lists of guards, paid by none but citizens and
burgesses, and I attended at a council-general extraordinary to
receive the oath from the syndic Mussard. I was so impressed with
the kindness shown me on this occasion by the council and the
consistory, and by the great civility and obliging behavior of the
magistrates, ministers and citizens, that, pressed by the worthy De
Luc, who was incessant in his persuasions, and still more so by my
own inclination, I did not think of going back to Paris for any other
purpose than to break up housekeeping, find a situation for M. and
Madam le Vassear, or provide for their subsistence, and then return
with Theresa to Geneva, there to settle for the rest of my days.
After taking this resolution I suspended all serious affairs the better
to enjoy the company of my friends until the time of my departure. Of
all the amusements of which I partook, that with which I was most
pleased, was sailing round the lake in a boat, with De Luc, the father,
his daughter-in-law, his two sons, and my Theresa. We gave seven
days to this excursion in the finest weather possible. I preserved a
lively remembrance of the situation which struck me at the other
extremity of the lake, and of which I, some years afterwards, gave a
description in my New Eloisa.
The principal connections I made at Geneva, besides the De Lucs,
of which I have spoken, were the young Vernes, with whom I had
already been acquainted at Paris, and of whom I then formed a
better opinion than I afterwards had of him. M. Perdriau, then a
country pastor, now professor of Belles Lettres, whose mild and
agreeable society will ever make me regret the loss of it, although he
has since thought proper to detach himself from me; M. Jalabert, at
that time professor of natural philosophy, since become counsellor

and syndic, to whom I read my discourse upon Inequality (but not the
dedication), with which he seemed to be delighted; the Professor
Lullin, with whom I maintained a correspondence until his death, and
who gave me a commission to purchase books for the library; the
Professor Vernet, who, like most other people, turned his back upon
me after I had given him proofs of attachment and confidence of
which he ought to, have been sensible, if a theologian can be
affected by anything; Chappins, clerk and successor to Gauffecourt,
whom he wished to supplant, and who, soon afterwards, was him
self supplanted; Marcet de Mezieres, an old friend of my father's,
and who had also shown himself to be mine: after having well
deserved of his country, he became a dramatic author, and,
pretending to be of the council of two hundred, changed his
principles, and, before he died, became ridiculous. But he from
whom I expected most was M. Moultout, a very promising young
man by his talents and his brilliant imagination, whom I have always
loved, although his conduct with respect to me was frequently
equivocal, and, not withstanding his being connected with my most
cruel enemies, whom I cannot but look upon as destined to become
the defender of my memory and the avenger of his friend.
In the midst of these dissipations, I neither lost the taste for my
solitary excursions, nor the habit of them; I frequently made long
ones upon the banks of the lake, during which my mind, accustomed
to reflection, did not remain idle; I digested the plan already formed
of my political institutions, of which I shall shortly have to speak; I
meditated a history of the Valais; the plan of a tragedy in prose, the
subject of which, nothing less than Lucretia, did not deprive me of
the hope of succeeding, although I had dared again to exhibit that
unfortunate heroine, when she could no longer be suffered upon any
French stage. I at that time tried my abilities with Tacitus, and
translated the first books of his history, which will be found amongst
my papers.
After a residence of four months at Geneva, I returned in the
month of October to Paris; and avoided passing through Lyons that I
might not again have to travel with Gauffecourt. As the arrangement
I had made did not require my being at Geneva until the spring
following, I returned, during the winter, to my habits and occupations;

the principal of the latter was examining the proof sheets of my
discourse on the Inequality of Mankind, which I had procured to be
printed in Holland, by the bookseller Rey, with whom I had just
become acquainted at Geneva. This work was dedicated to the
republic; but as the publication might be unpleasing to the council, I
wished to wait until it had taken its effect at Geneva before I returned
thither. This effect was not favorable to me; and the dedication,
which the most pure patriotism had dictated, created me enemies in
the council, and inspired even many of the burgesses with jealousy.
M. Chouet, at that time first syndic, wrote me a polite but very cold
letter, which will be found amongst my papers. I received from
private persons, amongst others from Du Luc and De Jalabert, a few
compliments, and these were all. I did not perceive that a single
Genevese was pleased with the hearty zeal found in the work. This
indifference shocked all those by whom it was remarked. I remember
that dining one day at Clichy, at Madam Dupin's, with Crommelin,
resident from the republic, and M. de Mairan, the latter openly
declared the council owed me a present and public honors for the
work, and that it would dishonor itself if it failed in either. Crommelin,
who was a black and mischievous little man, dared not reply in my
presence, but he made a frightful grimace, which however forced a
smile from Madam Dupin. The only advantage this work procured
me, besides that resulting from the satisfaction of my own heart, was
the title of citizen given me by my friends, afterwards by the public
after their example, and which I afterwards lost by having too well
merited.
This ill success would not, however, have prevented my retiring to
Geneva, had not more powerful motives tended to the same effect.
M. D'Epinay, wishing to add a wing which was wanting to the
chateau of the Chevrette, was at an immense expense in completing
it. Going one day with Madam D'Epinay to see the building, we
continued our walk a quarter of a league further to the reservoir of
the waters of the park which joined the forest of Montmorency, and
where there was a handsome kitchen garden, with a little lodge,
much out of repair, called the Hermitage. This solitary and very
agreeable place had struck me when I saw it for the first time before
my journey to Geneva. I had exclaimed in my transport: "Ah, madam,

what a delightful habitation! This asylum was purposely prepared for
me." Madam D'Epinay did not pay much attention to what I said; but
at this second journey I was quite surprised to find, instead of the old
decayed building, a little house almost entirely new, well laid out, and
very habitable for a little family of three persons. Madam D'Epinay
had caused this to be done in silence, and at a very small expense,
by detaching a few materials and some of the work men from the
castle. She now said to me, on remarking my surprise: "My dear,
here behold your asylum; it is you who have chosen it; friendship
offers it to you. I hope this will remove from you the cruel idea of
separating from me." I do not think I was ever in my life more
strongly or more deliciously affected. I bathed with tears the
beneficent hand of my friend; and if I were not conquered from that
very instant even, I was extremely staggered. Madam D'Epinay, who
would not be denied, became so pressing, employed so many
means, so many people to circumvent me, proceeding even so far
as to gain over Madam le Vasseur and her daughter, that at length
she triumphed over all my resolutions. Renouncing the idea of
residing in my own country, I resolved, I promised, to inhabit the
Hermitage; and, whilst the building was drying, Madam D'Epinay
took care to prepare furniture, so that everything was ready the
following spring.

One thing which greatly aided me in determining, was the
residence Voltaire had chosen near Geneva; I easily comprehended
this man would cause a revolution there, and that I should find in my
country the manners, which drove me from Paris; that I should be
under the necessity of incessantly struggling hard, and have no other
alternative than that of being an unsupportable pedant, a poltroon, or
a bad citizen. The letter Voltaire wrote me on my last work, induced
me to insinuate my fears in my answer; and the effect this produced
confirmed them. From that moment I considered Geneva as lost, and
I was not deceived. I perhaps ought to have met the storm, had I

thought myself capable of resisting it. But what could I have done
alone, timid, and speaking badly, against a man, arrogant, opulent,
supported by the credit of the great, eloquent, and already the idol of
the women and young men? I was afraid of uselessly exposing
myself to danger to no purpose. I listened to nothing but my peaceful
disposition, to my love of repose, which, if it then deceived me, still
continues to deceive me on the same subject. By retiring to Geneva,
I should have avoided great misfortunes; but I have my doubts
whether, with all my ardent and patriotic zeal, I should have been
able to effect anything great and useful for my country.
Tronchin, who about the same time went to reside at Geneva,
came afterwards to Paris and brought with him treasures. At his
arrival he came to see me, with the Chevalier Jaucourt. Madam
D'Epinay had a strong desire to consult him in private, but this it was
not easy to do. She addressed herself to me, and I engaged
Tronchin to go and see her. Thus under my auspices they began a
connection, which was afterwards increased at my expense. Such
has ever been my destiny: the moment I had united two friends who
were separately mine, they never failed to combine against me.
Although, in the conspiracy then formed by the Tronchins, they must
all have borne me a mortal hatred. He still continued friendly to me:
he even wrote me a letter after his return to Geneva, to propose to
me the place of honorary librarian. But I had taken my resolution,
and the offer did not tempt me to depart from it.
About this time I again visited M. d'Holbach. My visit was
occasioned by the death of his wife, which, as well as that of Madam
Francueil, happened whilst I was at Geneva. Diderot, when he
communicated to me these melancholy events, spoke of the deep
affliction of the husband. His grief affected my heart. I myself was
grieved for the loss of that excellent woman, and wrote to M.
d'Holbach a letter of condolence. I forgot all the wrongs he had done
me, and at my return from Geneva, and after he had made the tour
of France with Grimm and other friends to alleviate his affliction, I
went to see him, and continued my visits until my departure for the
Hermitage. As soon as it was known in his circle that Madam
D'Epinay was preparing me a habitation there, innumerable
sarcasms, founded upon the want I must feel of the flattery and

amusement of the city, and the supposition of my not being able to
support the solitude for a fortnight, were uttered against me. Feeling
within myself how I stood affected, I left him and his friends to say
what they pleased, and pursued my intention. M. d'Holbach rendered
me some services in finding a place for the old Le Vasseur, who was
eighty years of age and a burden to his wife, from which she begged
me to relieve her.
[This is an instance of the treachery of my memory. A long
time
after I had written what I have stated above, I learned, in
conversing with my wife, that it was not M. d'Holbach, but
M. de
Chenonceaux, then one of the administrators of the Hotel
Dieu, who
procured this place for her father. I had so totally forgotten
the
circumstance, and the idea of M. d'Holbach's having done it
was so
strong in my mind that I would have sworn it had been him.]
He was put into a house of charity, where, almost as soon as he
arrived there, age and the grief of finding himself removed from his
family sent him to the grave. His wife and all his children, except
Theresa, did not much regret his loss. But she, who loved him
tenderly, has ever since been inconsolable, and never forgiven
herself for having suffered him, at so advanced an age, to end his
days in any other house than her own.
Much about the same time I received a visit I little expected,
although it was from a very old acquaintance. My friend Venture,
accompanied by another man, came upon me one morning by
surprise. What a change did I discover in his person! Instead of his
former gracefulness, he appeared sottish and vulgar, which made
me extremely reserved with him. My eyes deceived me, or either
debauchery had stupefied his mind, or all his first splendor was the
effect of his youth, which was past. I saw him almost with
indifference, and we parted rather coolly. But when he was gone, the

remembrance of our former connection so strongly called to my
recollection that of my younger days, so charmingly, so prudently
dedicated to that angelic woman (Madam de Warrens) who was not
much less changed than himself; the little anecdotes of that happy
time, the romantic day of Toune passed with so much innocence and
enjoyment between those two charming girls, from whom a kiss of
the hand was the only favor, and which, notwithstanding its being so
trifling, had left me such lively, affecting and lasting regrets; and the
ravishing delirium of a young heart, which I had just felt in all its
force, and of which I thought the season forever past for me. The
tender remembrance of these delightful circumstances made me
shed tears over my faded youth and its transports for ever lost to me.
Ah! how many tears should I have shed over their tardy and fatal
return had I foreseen the evils I had yet to suffer from them.
Before I left Paris, I enjoyed during the winter which preceded my
retreat, a pleasure after my own heart, and of which I tasted in all its
purity. Palissot, academician of Nancy, known by a few dramatic
compositions, had just had one of them performed at Luneville
before the King of Poland. He perhaps thought to make his court by
representing in his piece a man who had dared to enter into a literary
dispute with the king. Stanislaus, who was generous, and did not like
satire, was filled with indignation at the author's daring to be
personal in his presence. The Comte de Tressan, by order of the
prince, wrote to M. d'Alembert, as well as to myself, to inform me that
it was the intention of his majesty to have Palissot expelled his
academy. My answer was a strong solicitation in favor of Palissot,
begging M. de Tressan to intercede with the king in his behalf. His
pardon was granted, and M. de Tressan, when he communicated to
me the information in the name of the monarch, added that the
whole of what had passed should be inserted in the register of the
academy. I replied that this was less granting a pardon than
perpetuating a punishment. At length, after repeated solicitations, I
obtained a promise, that nothing relative to the affair should be
inserted in the register, and that no public trace should remain of it.
The promise was accompanied, as well on the part of the king as on
that of M. de Tressan, with assurance of esteem and respect, with
which I was extremely flattered; and I felt on this occasion that the

esteem of men who are themselves worthy of it, produced in the
mind a sentiment infinitely more noble and pleasing than that of
vanity. I have transcribed into my collection the letters of M. de
Tressan, with my answers to them: and the original of the former will
be found amongst my other papers.
I am perfectly aware that if ever these memoirs become public, I
here perpetuate the remembrance of a fact which I would wish to
efface every trace; but I transmit many others as much against my
inclination. The grand object of my undertaking, constantly before my
eyes, and the indispensable duty of fulfilling it to its utmost extent,
will not permit me to be turned aside by trifling considerations, which
would lead me from my purpose. In my strange and unparalleled
situation, I owe too much to truth to be further than this indebted to
any person whatever. They who wish to know me well must be
acquainted with me in every point of view, in every relative situation,
both good and bad. My confessions are necessarily connected with
those of many other people: I write both with the same frankness in
everything that relates to that which has befallen me; and am not
obliged to spare any person more than myself, although it is my wish
to do it. I am determined always to be just and true, to say of others
all the good I can, never speaking of evil except when it relates to my
own conduct, and there is a necessity for my so doing. Who, in the
situation in which the world has placed me, has a right to require
more at my hands? My confessions are not intended to appear
during my lifetime, nor that of those they may disagreeably affect.
Were I master of my own destiny, and that of the book I am now
writing, it should never be made public until after my death and
theirs. But the efforts which the dread of truth obliges my powerful
enemies to make to destroy every trace of it, render it necessary for
me to do everything, which the strictest right, and the most severe
justice, will permit, to preserve what I have written. Were the
remembrance of me to be lost at my dissolution, rather than expose
any person alive, I would without a murmur suffer an unjust and
momentary reproach. But since my name is to live, it is my duty to
endeavor to transmit with it to posterity the remembrance of the
unfortunate man by whom it was borne, such as he really was, and

not such as his unjust enemies incessantly endeavored to describe
him.

My impatience to inhabit the Hermitage not permitting me to wait
until the return of fine weather, the moment my lodging was prepared
I hastened to take possession of it, to the great amusement of the
'Coterie Holbachaque', which publicly predicted I should not be able
to support solitude for three months, and that I should unsuccessfully
return to Paris, and live there as they did. For my part, having for
fifteen years been out of my element, finding myself upon the eve of
returning to it, I paid no attention to their pleasantries. Since contrary
to my inclinations, I have again entered the world, I have incessantly
regretted my dear Charmettes, and the agreeable life I led there. I
felt a natural inclination to retirement and the country: it was
impossible for me to live happily elsewhere. At Venice, in the train of
public affairs, in the dignity of a kind of representation, in the pride of
projects of advancement; at Paris, in the vortex of the great world, in
the luxury of suppers, in the brilliancy of spectacles, in the rays of
splendor; my groves, rivulets, and solitary walks, constantly
presented themselves to my recollection, interrupted my thought,
rendered me melancholy, and made me sigh with desire. All the
labor to which I had subjected myself, every project of ambition
which by fits had animated my ardor, all had for object this happy
country retirement, which I now thought near at hand. Without having
acquired a genteel independence, which I had judged to be the only
means of accomplishing my views, I imagined myself, in my
particular situation, to be able to do without it, and that I could obtain
the same end by a means quite opposite. I had no regular income;
but I possessed some talents, and had acquired a name. My wants
were few, and I had freed myself from all those which were most

expensive, and which merely depended on prejudice and opinion.
Besides this, although naturally indolent, I was laborious when I
chose to be so. and my idleness was less that of an indolent man,
than that of an independent one who applies to business when it
pleases him. My profession of a copyist of music was neither
splendid nor lucrative, but it was certain. The world gave me credit
for the courage I had shown in making choice of it. I might depend
upon having sufficient employment to enable me to live. Two
thousand livres which remained of the produce of the 'Devin du
Village', and my other writings, were a sum which kept me from
being straitened, and several works I had upon the stocks promised
me, without extorting money from the booksellers, supplies sufficient
to enable me to work at my ease without exhausting myself, even by
turning to advantage the leisure of my walks. My little family,
consisting of three persons, all of whom were usefully employed,
was not expensive to support. Finally, from my resources,
proportioned to my wants and desires, I might reasonably expect a
happy and permanent existence, in that manner of life which my
inclination had induced me to adopt.
I might have taken the interested side of the question, and, instead
of subjecting my pen to copying, entirely devoted it to works which,
from the elevation to which I had soared, and at which I found myself
capable of continuing, might have enabled me to live in the midst of
abundance, nay, even of opulence, had I been the least disposed to
join the manoeuvres of an author to the care of publishing a good
book. But I felt that writing for bread would soon have extinguished
my genius, and destroyed my talents, which were less in my pen
than in my heart, and solely proceeded from an elevated and noble
manner of thinking, by which alone they could be cherished and
preserved. Nothing vigorous or great can come from a pen totally
venal. Necessity, nay, even avarice, perhaps, would have made me
write rather rapidly than well. If the desire of success had not led me
into cabals, it might have made me endeavor to publish fewer true
and useful works than those which might be pleasing to the
multitude; and instead of a distinguished author, which I might
possibly become, I should have been nothing more than a scribbler.
No: I have always felt that the profession of letters was illustrious in

proportion as it was less a trade. It is too difficult to think nobly when
we think for a livelihood. To be able to dare even to speak great
truths, an author must be independent of success. I gave my books
to the public with a certainty of having written for the general good of
mankind, without giving myself the least concern about what was to
follow. If the work was thrown aside, so much the worse for such as
did not choose to profit by it. Their approbation was not necessary to
enable me to live, my profession was sufficient to maintain me had
not my works had a sale, for which reason alone they all sold.
It was on the ninth of August,
, that I left cities, never to reside
in them again: for I do not call a residence the few days I afterwards
remained in Paris, London, or other cities, always on the wing, or
contrary to my inclinations. Madam d'Epinay came and took us all
three in her coach; her farmer carted away my little baggage, and I
was put into possession the same day. I found my little retreat simply
furnished, but neatly, and with some taste. The hand which had lent
its aid in this furnishing rendered it inestimable in my eyes, and I
thought it charming to be the guest of my female friend in a house I
had made choice of, and which she had caused to be built purposely
for me.
Although the weather was cold, and the ground lightly covered
with snow, the earth began to vegetate: violets and primroses
already made their appearance, the trees began to bud, and the
evening of my arrival was distinguished by the song of the
nightingale, which was heard almost under my window, in a wood
adjoining the house. After a light sleep, forgetting when I awoke my
change of abode, I still thought myself in the Rue Grenelle, when
suddenly this warbling made me give a start, and I exclaimed in my
transport: "At length, all my wishes are accomplished!" The first thing
I did was to abandon myself to the impression of the rural objects
with which I was surrounded. Instead of beginning to set things in
order in my new habitation, I began by doing it for my walks, and
there was not a path, a copse, a grove, nor a corner in the environs
of my place of residence that I did not visit the next day. The more I
examined this charming retreat, the more I found it to my wishes.
This solitary, rather than savage, spot transported me in idea to the
end of the world. It had striking beauties which are but seldom found

near cities, and never, if suddenly transported thither, could any
person have imagined himself within four leagues of Paris.
After abandoning myself for a few days to this rural delirium, I
began to arrange my papers, and regulate my occupations. I set
apart, as I had always done, my mornings to copying, and my
afternoons to walking, provided with my little paper book and a
pencil, for never having been able to write and think at my ease
except 'sub dio', I had no inclination to depart from this method, and I
was persuaded the forest of Montmorency, which was almost at my
door, would in future be my closet and study. I had several works
begun; these I cast my eye over. My mind was indeed fertile in great
projects, but in the noise of the city the execution of them had gone
on but slowly. I proposed to myself to use more diligence when I
should be less interrupted. I am of opinion I have sufficiently fulfilled
this intention; and for a man frequently ill, often at La Chevrette, at
Epinay, at Raubonne, at the castle of Montmorency, at other times
interrupted by the indolent and curious, and always employed half
the day in copying, if what I produced during the six years I passed
at the Hermitage and at Montmorency be considered, I am
persuaded it will appear that if, in this interval, I lost my time, it was
not in idleness.
Of the different works I had upon the stocks, that I had longest
resolved in my mind which was most to my taste; to which I destined
a certain portion of my life, and which, in my opinion, was to confirm
the reputation I had acquired, was my 'Institutions Politiques. I had,
fourteen years before, when at Venice, where I had an opportunity of
remarking the defects of that government so much boasted of,
conceived the first idea of them. Since that time my views had
become much more extended by the historical study of morality. I
had perceived everything to be radically connected with politics, and
that, upon whatever principles these were founded, a people would
never be more than that which the nature of the government made
them; therefore the great question of the best government possible
appeared to me to be reduced to this: What is the nature of a
government the most proper to form the most virtuous and
enlightened, the wisest and best people, taking the last epithet in its
most extensive meaning? I thought this question was much if not

quite of the same nature with that which follows: What government is
that which, by its nature, always maintains itself nearest to the laws,
or least deviates from the laws. Hence, what is the law? and a series
of questions of similar importance. I perceived these led to great
truths, useful to the happiness of mankind, but more especially to
that of my country, wherein, in the journey I had just made to it, I had
not found notions of laws and liberty either sufficiently just or clear. I
had thought this indirect manner of communicating these to my
fellow-citizens would be least mortifying to their pride, and might
obtain me forgiveness for having seen a little further than
themselves.
Although I had already labored five or six years at the work, the
progress I had made in it was not considerable. Writings of this kind
require meditation, leisure and tranquillity. I had besides written the
'Institutions Politiques', as the expression is, 'en bonne fortune', and
had not communicated my project to any person; not even to
Diderot. I was afraid it would be thought too daring for the age and
country in which I wrote, and that the fears of my friends would
restrain me from carrying it into execution.
[It was more especially the wise severity of Duclos which
inspired
me with this fear; as for Diderot, I know not by what means
all my
conferences with him tended to make me more satirical
than my
natural disposition inclined me to be. This prevented me
from
consulting him upon an undertaking, in which I wished to
introduce
nothing but the force of reasoning without the least
appearance of
ill humor or partiality. The manner of this work may be
judged of
by that of the 'Contrat Social', which is taken from it.]

I did not yet know that it would be finished in time, and in such a
manner as to appear before my decease. I wished fearlessly to give
to my subject everything it required; fully persuaded that not being of
a satirical turn, and never wishing to be personal, I should in equity
always be judged irreprehensible. I undoubtedly wished fully to enjoy
the right of thinking which I had by birth; but still respecting the
government under which I lived, without ever disobeying its laws,
and very attentive not to violate the rights of persons, I would not
from fear renounce its advantages.
I confess, even that, as a stranger, and living in France, I found my
situation very favorable in daring to speak the truth; well knowing
that continuing, as I was determined to do, not to print anything in
the kingdom without permission, I was not obliged to give to any
person in it an account of my maxims nor of their publication
elsewhere. I should have been less independent even at Geneva,
where, in whatever place my books might have been printed, the
magistrate had a right to criticise their contents. This consideration
had greatly contributed to make me yield to the solicitations of
Madam d'Epinay, and abandon the project of fixing my residence at
Geneva. I felt, as I have remarked in my Emilius, that unless an
author be a man of intrigue, when he wishes to render his works
really useful to any country whatsoever, he must compose them in
some other.
What made me find my situation still more happy, was my being
persuaded that the government of France would, perhaps, without
looking upon me with a very favorable eye, make it a point to protect
me, or at least not to disturb my tranquillity. It appeared to me a
stroke of simple, yet dexterous policy, to make a merit of tolerating
that which there was no means of preventing; since, had I been
driven from France, which was all government had the right to do,
my work would still have been written, and perhaps with less
reserve; whereas if I were left undisturbed, the author remained to
answer for what he wrote, and a prejudice, general throughout all
Europe, would be destroyed by acquiring the reputation of observing
a proper respect for the rights of persons.
They who, by the event, shall judge I was deceived, may perhaps
be deceived in their turn. In the storm which has since broken over

my head, my books served as a pretence, but it was against my
person that every shaft was directed. My persecutors gave
themselves but little concern about the author, but they wished to
ruin Jean Jacques; and the greatest evil they found in my writings
was the honor they might possibly do me. Let us not encroach upon
the future. I do not know that this mystery, which is still one to me,
will hereafter be cleared up to my readers; but had my avowed
principles been of a nature to bring upon me the treatment I
received, I should sooner have become their victim, since the work in
which these principles are manifested with most courage, not to call
it audacity, seemed to have had its effect previous to my retreat to
the Hermitage, without I will not only say my having received the
least censure, but without any steps having been taken to prevent
the publication of it in France, where it was sold as publicly as in
Holland. The New Eloisa afterwards appeared with the same facility,
I dare add; with the same applause: and, what seems incredible, the
profession of faith of this Eloisa at the point of death is exactly similar
to that of the Savoyard vicar. Every strong idea in the Social Contract
had been before published in the discourse on Inequality; and every
bold opinion in Emilius previously found in Eloisa. This unrestrained
freedom did not excite the least murmur against the first two works;
therefore it was not that which gave cause to it against the latter.
Another undertaking much of the same kind, but of which the
project was more recent, then engaged my attention: this was the
extract of the works of the Abbe de Saint Pierre, of which, having
been led away by the thread of my narrative, I have not hitherto been
able to speak. The idea was suggested to me, after my return from
Geneva, by the Abbe Malby, not immediately from himself, but by the
interposition of Madam Dupin, who had some interest in engaging
me to adopt it. She was one of the three or four-pretty women of
Paris, of whom the Abbe de Saint Pierre had been the spoiled child,
and although she had not decidedly had the preference, she had at
least partaken of it with Madam d'Aiguillon. She preserved for the
memory of the good man a respect and an affection which did honor
to them both; and her self-love would have been flattered by seeing
the still-born works of her friend brought to life by her secretary.
These works contained excellent things, but so badly told that the

reading of them was almost insupportable; and it is astonishing the
Abbe de Saint Pierre, who looked upon his readers as schoolboys,
should nevertheless have spoken to them as men, by the little care
he took to induce them to give him a hearing. It was for this purpose
that the work was proposed to me as useful in itself, and very proper
for a man laborious in manoeuvre, but idle as an author, who finding
the trouble of thinking very fatiguing, preferred, in things which
pleased him, throwing a light upon and extending the ideas of others,
to producing any himself. Besides, not being confined to the
functions of a translator, I was at liberty sometimes to think for
myself; and I had it in my power to give such a form to my work, that
many important truths would pass in it under the name of the Abbe
de Saint Pierre, much more safely than under mine. The undertaking
also was not trifling; the business was nothing less than to read and
meditate twenty-three volumes, diffuse, confused, full of long
narrations and periods, repetitions, and false or little views, from
amongst which it was necessary to select some few that were good
and useful, and sufficiently encouraging to enable me to support the
painful labor. I frequently wished to have given it up, and should
have done so, could I have got it off my hands with a great grace;
but when I received the manuscripts of the abbe, which were given
to me by his nephew, the Comte de Saint Pierre, I had, by the
solicitation of St. Lambert, in some measure engaged to make use of
them, which I must either have done, or have given them back. It
was with the former intention I had taken the manuscripts to the
Hermitage, and this was the first work to which I proposed to
dedicate my leisure hours.
I had likewise in my own mind projected a third, the idea of which I
owed to the observations I had made upon myself and I felt the more
disposed to undertake this work, as I had reason to hope I could
make it a truly useful one, and perhaps, the most so of any that
could be offered to the world, were the execution equal to the plan I
had laid down. It has been remarked that most men are in the course
of their lives frequently unlike themselves, and seem to be
transformed into others very different from what they were. It was not
to establish a thing so generally known that I wished to write a book;
I had a newer and more important object. This was to search for the

causes of these variations, and, by confining my observations to
those which depend on ourselves, to demonstrate in what manner it
might be possible to direct them, in order to render us better and
more certain of our dispositions. For it is undoubtedly more painful to
an honest man to resist desires already formed, and which it is his
duty to subdue, than to prevent, change, or modify the same desires
in their source, were he capable of tracing them to it. A man under
temptation resists once because he has strength of mind, he yields
another time because this is overcome; had it been the same as
before he would again have triumphed.
By examining within myself, and searching in others what could be
the cause of these different manners of being, I discovered that, in a
great measure they depended on the anterior impressions of
external objects; and that, continually modified by our senses and
organs, we, without knowing it, bore in our ideas, sentiments, and
even actions, the effect of these modifications. The striking and
numerous observations I had collected were beyond all manner of
dispute, and by their natural principle seemed proper to furnish an
exterior regimen, which varied according to circumstances, might
place and support the mind in the state most favorable to virtue.
From how many mistakes would reason be preserved, how many
vices would be stifled in their birth, were it possible to force animal
economy to favor moral order, which it so frequently disturbs!
Climate, seasons, sounds, colors, light, darkness, the elements,
ailments, noise, silence, motion, rest, all act on the animal machine,
and consequently on the mind: all offer a thousand means, almost
certain of directing in their origin the sentiments by which we suffer
ourselves to be governed. Such was the fundamental idea of which I
had already made a sketch upon paper, and whence I hoped for an
effect the more certain, in favor of persons well disposed, who,
sincerely loving virtue, were afraid of their own weakness, as it
appeared to me easy to make of it a book as agreeable to read as it
was to compose. I have, however, applied myself but very little to
this work, the title of which was to have been 'Morale Sensitive' ou le
Materialisme du Sage. --[Sensitive Morality, or the Materialism of the
Sage.]--Interruptions, the cause of which will soon appear, prevented
me from continuing it, and the fate of the sketch, which is more

connected with my own than it may appear to be, will hereafter be
seen.
Besides this, I had for some time meditated a system of education,
of which Madam de Chenonceaux, alarmed for her son by that of her
husband, had desired me to consider. The authority of friendship
placed this object, although less in itself to my taste, nearer to my
heart than any other. On which account this subject, of all those of
which I have just spoken, is the only one I carried to its utmost
extent. The end I proposed to myself in treating of it should, I think,
have procured the author a better fate. But I will not here anticipate
this melancholy subject. I shall have too much reason to speak of it
in the course of my work.
These different objects offered me subjects of meditation for my
walks; for, as I believed I had already observed, I am unable to
reflect when I am not walking: the moment I stop, I think no more,
and as soon as I am again in motion my head resumes its workings.
I had, however, provided myself with a work for the closet upon rainy
days. This was my dictionary of music, which my scattered,
mutilated, and unshapen materials made it necessary to rewrite
almost entirely. I had with me some books necessary to this purpose;
I had spent two months in making extracts from others, I had
borrowed from the king's library, whence I was permitted to take
several to the Hermitage. I was thus provided with materials for
composing in my apartment when the weather did not permit me to
go out, and my copying fatigued me. This arrangement was so
convenient that it made it turn to advantage as well at the Hermitage
as at Montmorency, and afterwards even at Motiers, where I
completed the work whilst I was engaged in others, and constantly
found a change of occupation to be a real relaxation.
During a considerable time I exactly followed the distribution I had
prescribed myself, and found it very agreeable; but as soon as the
fine weather brought Madam d'Epinay more frequently to Epinay, or
to the Chervette, I found that attentions, in the first instance natural
to me, but which I had not considered in my scheme, considerably
deranged my projects. I have already observed that Madam d'Epinay
had many amiable qualities; she sincerely loved her friends; served
them with zeal; and, not sparing for them either time or pains,

certainly deserved on their part every attention in return. I had
hitherto discharged this duty without considering it as one, but at
length I found that I had given myself a chain of which nothing but
friendship prevented me from feeling the weight, and this was still
aggravated by my dislike to numerous societies. Madam d' Epinay
took advantage of these circumstances to make me a proposition
seemingly agreeable to me, but which was more so to herself; this
was to let me know when she was alone, or had but little company. I
consented, without perceiving to what a degree I engaged myself.
The consequence was that I no longer visited her at my own hour -but at hers, and that I never was certain of being master of myself for
a day together. This constraint considerably diminished the pleasure
I had in going to see her. I found the liberty she had so frequently
promised was given me upon no other condition than that of my
never enjoying it; and once or twice when I wished to do this there
were so many messages, notes, and alarms relative to my health,
that I perceived that I could have no excuse but being confined to my
bed, for not immediately running to her upon the first intimation. It
was necessary I should submit to this yoke, and I did it, even more
voluntarily than could be expected from so great an enemy to
dependence: the sincere attachment I had to Madam D'Epinay
preventing me, in a great measure, from feeling the inconvenience
with which it was accompanied. She, on her part, filled up, well or ill,
the void which the absence of her usual circle left in her
amusements. This for her was but a very slender supplement,
although preferable to absolute solitude, which she could not
support. She had the means of doing it much more at her ease after
she began with literature, and at all events to write novels, letters,
comedies, tales, and other trash of the same kind. But she was not
so much amused in writing these as in reading them; and she never
scribbled over two or three pages--at one sitting--without being
previously assured of having, at least, two or three benevolent
auditors at the end of so much labor. I seldom had the honor of being
one of the chosen few except by means of another. When alone, I
was, for the most part, considered as a cipher in everything; and this
not only in the company of Madam D'Epinay, but in that of M.
d'Holbach, and in every place where Grimm gave the 'ton'. This

nullity was very convenient to me, except in a tete-a-tete, when I
knew not what countenance to put on, not daring to speak of
literature, of which it was not for me to say a word; nor of gallantry,
being too timid, and fearing, more than death, the ridiculousness of
an old gallant; besides that, I never had such an idea when in the
company of Madam D'Epinay, and that it perhaps would never have
occurred to me, had I passed my whole life with her; not that her
person was in the least disagreeable to me; on the contrary, I loved
her perhaps too much as a friend to do it as a lover. I felt a pleasure
in seeing and speaking to her. Her conversation, although agreeable
enough in a mixed company, was uninteresting in private; mine, not
more elegant or entertaining than her own, was no great amusement
to her. Ashamed of being long silent, I endeavored to enliven our
tete-a-tete and, although this frequently fatigued me, I was never
disgusted with it. I was happy to show her little attentions, and gave
her little fraternal kisses, which seemed not to be more sensual to
herself; these were all. She was very thin, very pale, and had a
bosom which resembled the back of her hand. This defect alone
would have been sufficient to moderate my most ardent desires; my
heart never could distinguish a woman in a person who had it; and
besides other causes useless to mention, always made me forget
the sex of this lady.
Having resolved to conform to an assiduity which was necessary, I
immediately and voluntarily entered upon it, and for the first year at
least, found it less burthensome than I could have expected. Madam
d'Epinay, who commonly passed the summer in the country,
continued there but a part of this; whether she was more detained by
her affairs in Paris, or that the absence of Grimm rendered the
residence of the Chevrette less agreeable to her, I know not. I took
the advantage of the intervals of her absence, or when the company
with her was numerous, to enjoy my solitude with my good Theresa
and her mother, in such a manner as to taste all its charms. Although
I had for several years passed been frequently in the country, I
seldom had enjoyed much of its pleasures; and these excursions,
always made in company with people who considered themselves as
persons of consequence, and rendered insipid by constraint, served
to increase in me the natural desire I had for rustic pleasures. The

want of these was the more sensible to me as I had the image of
them immediately before my eyes. I was so tired of saloons, jets
d'eau, groves, parterres, and of more fatiguing persons by whom
they were shown; so exhausted with pamphlets, harpsichords, trios,
unravellings of plots, stupid bon mots, insipid affections, pitiful
storytellers, and great suppers; that when I gave a side glance at a
poor simple hawthorn bush, a hedge, a barn, or a meadow; when, in
passing through a hamlet, I scented a good chervil omelette, and
heard at a distance the burden of a rustic song of the Bisquieres; I
wished all rouge, furbelows and amber at the d---l, and envying the
dinner of the good housewife, and the wine of her own vineyard, I
heartily wished to give a slap on the chaps to Monsieur le Chef and
Monsieur le Maitre, who made me dine at the hour of supper, and
sup when I should have been asleep, but especially to Messieurs the
lackeys, who devoured with their eyes the morsel I put into my
mouth, and upon pain of my dying with thirst, sold me the
adulterated wine of their master, ten times dearer than that of a
better quality would have cost me at a public house.
At length I was settled in an agreeable and solitary asylum, at
liberty to pass there the remainder of my days, in that peaceful,
equal, and independent life for which I felt myself born. Before I
relate the effects this situation, so new to me, had upon my heart, it
is proper I should recapitulate its secret affections, that the reader
may better follow in their causes the progress of these new
modifications.
I have always considered the day on which I was united to
Theresa as that which fixed my moral existence. An attachment was
necessary for me, since that which should have been sufficient to my
heart had been so cruelly broken. The thirst after happiness is never
extinguished in the heart of man. Mamma was advancing into years,
and dishonored herself! I had proofs that she could never more be
happy here below; it therefore remained to me to seek my own
happiness, having lost all hopes of partaking of hers. I was
sometimes irresolute, and fluctuated from one idea to another, and
from project to project. My journey to Venice would have thrown me
into public life, had the man with whom, almost against my
inclination, I was connected there had common sense. I was easily

discouraged, especially in undertakings of length and difficulty. The
ill success of this disgusted me with every other; and, according to
my old maxims, considering distant objects as deceitful allurements,
I resolved in future to provide for immediate wants, seeing nothing in
life which could tempt me to make extraordinary efforts.
It was precisely at this time we became acquainted. The mild
character of the good Theresa seemed so fitted to my own, that I
united myself to her with an attachment which neither time nor
injuries have been able to impair, and which has constantly been
increased by everything by which it might have been expected to be
diminished. The force of this sentiment will hereafter appear when I
come to speak of the wounds she has given my heart in the height of
my misery, without my ever having, until this moment, once uttered a
word of complaint to any person whatever.
When it shall be known, that after having done everything, braved
everything, not to separate from her; that after passing with her
twenty years in despite of fate and men; I have in my old age made
her my wife, without the least expectation or solicitation on her part,
or promise or engagement on mine, the world will think that love
bordering upon madness, having from the first moment turned my
head, led me by degrees to the last act of extravagance; and this will
no longer appear doubtful when the strong and particular reasons
which should forever have prevented me from taking such a step are
made known. What, therefore, will the reader think when I shall have
told him, with all the truth he has ever found in me, that, from the first
moment in which I saw her, until that wherein I write, I have never felt
the least love for her, that I never desired to possess her more than I
did to possess Madam de Warrens, and that the physical wants
which were satisfied with her person were, to me, solely those of the
sex, and by no means proceeding from the individual? He will think
that, being of a constitution different from that of other men, I was
incapable of love, since this was not one of the sentiments which
attached me to women the most dear to my heart. Patience, O my
dear reader! the fatal moment approaches in which you will be but
too much undeceived.
I fall into repetitions; I know it; and these are necessary. The first
of my wants, the greatest, strongest and most insatiable, was wholly

in my heart; the want of an intimate connection, and as intimate as it
could possibly be: for this reason especially, a woman was more
necessary to me than a man, a female rather than a male friend.
This singular want was such that the closest corporal union was not
sufficient: two souls would have been necessary to me in the same
body, without which I always felt a void. I thought I was upon the
point of filling it up forever. This young person, amiable by a
thousand excellent qualities, and at that time by her form, without the
shadow of art or coquetry, would have confined within herself my
whole existence, could hers, as I had hoped it would, have been
totally confined to me. I had nothing to fear from men; I am certain of
being the only man she ever really loved and her moderate passions
seldom wanted another not even after I ceased in this respect to be
one to her. I had no family; she had one; and this family was
composed of individuals whose dispositions were so different from
mine, that I could never make it my own. This was the first cause of
my unhappiness. What would I not have given to be the child of her
mother? I did everything in my power to become so, but could never
succeed. I in vain attempted to unite all our interests: this was
impossible. She always created herself one different from mine,
contrary to it, and to that even of her daughter, which already was no
longer separated from it. She, her other children, and grand-children,
became so many leeches, and the least evil these did to Theresa
was robbing her. The poor girl, accustomed to submit, even to her
nieces, suffered herself to be pilfered and governed without saying a
word; and I perceived with grief that by exhausting my purse, and
giving her advice, I did nothing that could be of any real advantage to
her. I endeavored to detach her from her mother; but she constantly
resisted such a proposal. I could not but respect her resistance, and
esteemed her the more for it; but her refusal was not on this account
less to the prejudice of us both. Abandoned to her mother and the
rest of her family, she was more their companion than mine, and
rather at their command than mistress of herself. Their avarice was
less ruinous than their advice was pernicious to her; in fact, if, on
account of the love she had for me, added to her good natural
disposition, she was not quite their slave, she was enough so to
prevent in a great measure the effect of the good maxims I

endeavored to instil into her, and, notwithstanding all my efforts, to
prevent our being united.
Thus was it, that notwithstanding a sincere and reciprocal
attachment, in which I had lavished all the tenderness of my heart,
the void in that heart was never completely filled. Children, by whom
this effect should have been produced, were brought into the world,
but these only made things worse. I trembled at the thought of
intrusting them to a family ill brought up, to be still worse educated.
The risk of the education of the foundling hospital was much less.
This reason for the resolution I took, much stronger than all those I
stated in my letter to Madam de Francueil, was, however, the only
one with which I dared not make her acquainted; I chose rather to
appear less excusable than to expose to reproach the family of a
person I loved. But by the conduct of her wretched brother,
notwithstanding all that can be said in his defence, it will be judged
whether or not I ought to have exposed my children to an education
similar to his.
Not having it in my power to taste in all its plentitude the charms of
that intimate connection of which I felt the want, I sought for
substitutes which did not fill up the void, yet they made it less
sensible. Not having a friend entirely devoted to me, I wanted others,
whose impulse should overcome my indolence; for this reason I
cultivated and strengthened my connection with Diderot and the
Abbe de Condillac, formed with Grimm a new one still more intimate,
till at length by the unfortunate discourse, of which I have related
some particulars, I unexpectedly found myself thrown back into a
literary circle which I thought I had quitted forever.
My first steps conducted me by a new path to another intellectual
world, the simple and noble economy of which I cannot contemplate
without enthusiasm. I reflected so much on the subject that I soon
saw nothing but error and folly in the doctrine of our sages, and
oppression and misery in our social order. In the illusion of my foolish
pride, I thought myself capable of destroying all imposture; and
thinking that, to make myself listened to, it was necessary my
conduct should agree with my principles, I adopted the singular
manner of life which I have not been permitted to continue, the
example of which my pretended friends have never forgiven me,

which at first made me ridiculous, and would at length have rendered
me respectable, had it been possible for me to persevere.
Until then I had been good; from that moment I became virtuous,
or at least infatuated with virtue. This infatuation had begun in my
head, but afterwards passed into my heart. The most noble pride
there took root amongst the ruins of extirpated vanity. I affected
nothing; I became what I appeared to be, and during four years at
least, whilst this effervescence continued at its greatest height, there
is nothing great and good that can enter the heart of man, of which I
was not capable between heaven and myself. Hence flowed my
sudden eloquence; hence, in my first writings, that fire really
celestial, which consumed me, and whence during forty years not a
single spark had escaped, because it was not yet lighted up.
I was really transformed; my friends and acquaintance scarcely
knew me. I was no longer that timid, and rather bashful than modest
man, who neither dared to present himself, nor utter a word; whom a
single pleasantry disconcerted, and whose face was covered with a
blush the moment his eyes met those of a woman. I became bold,
haughty, intrepid, with a confidence the more firm, as it was simple,
and resided in my soul rather than in my manner. The contempt with
which my profound meditations had inspired me for the manners,
maxims and prejudices of the age in which I lived, rendered me proof
against the raillery of those by whom they were possessed, and I
crushed their little pleasantries with a sentence, as I would have
crushed an insect with my fingers.
What a change! All Paris repeated the severe and acute sarcasms
of the same man who, two years before, and ten years afterwards,
knew not how to find what he had to say, nor the word he ought to
employ. Let the situation in the world the most contrary to my natural
disposition be sought after, and this will be found. Let one of the
short moments of my life in which I became another man, and
ceased to be myself, be recollected, this also will be found in the
time of which I speak; but, instead of continuing only six days, or six
weeks, it lasted almost six years, and would perhaps still continue,
but for the particular circumstances which caused it to cease, and
restored me to nature, above which I had, wished to soar.

The beginning of this change took place as soon as I had quitted
Paris, and the sight of the vices of that city no longer kept up the
indignation with which it had inspired me. I no sooner had lost sight
of men than I ceased to despise them, and once removed from those
who designed me evil, my hatred against them no longer existed. My
heart, little fitted for hatred, pitied their misery, and even their
wickedness. This situation, more pleasing but less sublime, soon
allayed the ardent enthusiasm by which I had so long been
transported; and I insensibly, almost to myself even, again became
fearful, complaisant and timid; in a word, the same Jean Jacques I
before had been.
Had this resolution gone no further than restoring me to myself, all
would have been well; but unfortunately it rapidly carried me away to
the other extreme. From that moment my mind in agitation passed
the line of repose, and its oscillations, continually renewed, have
never permitted it to remain here. I must enter into some detail of this
second revolution; terrible and fatal era, of a fate unparalleled
amongst mortals.
We were but three persons in our retirement; it was therefore
natural our intimacy should be increased by leisure and solitude.
This was the case between Theresa and myself. We passed in
conversations in the shade the most charming and delightful hours,
more so than any I had hitherto enjoyed. She seemed to taste of this
sweet intercourse more than I had until then observed her to do; she
opened her heart, and communicated to me, relative to her mother
and family, things she had had resolution enough to conceal for a
great length of time. Both had received from Madam Dupin
numerous presents, made them on my account, and mostly for me,
but which the cunning old woman, to prevent my being angry, had
appropriated to her own use and that of her other children, without
suffering Theresa to have the least share, strongly forbidding her to
say a word to me of the matter: an order the poor girl had obeyed
with an incredible exactness.
But another thing which surprised me more than this had done,
was the discovery that besides the private conversations Diderot and
Grimm had frequently had with both to endeavor to detach them
from me, in which, by means of the resistance of Theresa, they had

not been able to succeed, they had afterwards had frequent
conferences with the mother, the subject of which was a secret to the
daughter. However, she knew little presents had been made, and
that there were mysterious goings backward and forward, the motive
of which was entirely unknown to her. When we left Paris, Madam le
Vasseur had long been in the habit of going to see Grimm twice or
thrice a month, and continuing with him for hours together, in
conversation so secret that the servant was always sent out of the
room.
I judged this motive to be of the same nature with the project into
which they had attempted to make the daughter enter, by promising
to procure her and her mother, by means of Madam d'Epinay, a salt
huckster's license, or snuff-shop; in a word, by tempting her with the
allurements of gain. They had been told that, as I was not in a
situation to do anything for them, I could not, on their account, do
anything for myself. As in all this I saw nothing but good intentions, I
was not absolutely displeased with them for it. The mystery was the
only thing which gave me pain, especially on the part of the old
woman, who moreover daily became more parasitical and flattering
towards me. This, however, did not prevent her from reproaching her
daughter in private with telling me everything, and loving me too
much, observing to her she was a fool and would at length be made
a dupe.
This woman possessed, to a supreme degree, the art of
multiplying the presents made her, by concealing from one what she
received from another, and from me what she received from all. I
could have pardoned her avarice, but it was impossible I should
forgive her dissimulation. What could she have to conceal from me
whose happiness she knew principally consisted in that of herself
and her daughter? What I had done for the daughter I had done for
myself, but the services I rendered the mother merited on her part
some acknowledgment. She ought, at least, to have thought herself
obliged for them to her daughter, and to have loved me for the sake
of her by whom I was already beloved. I had raised her from the
lowest state of wretchedness; she received from my hands the
means of subsistence, and was indebted to me for her acquaintance
with the persons from whom she found means to reap considerable

benefit. Theresa had long supported her by her industry, and now
maintained her with my bread. She owed everything to this daughter,
for whom she had done nothing, and her other children, to whom she
had given marriage portions, and on whose account she had ruined
herself, far from giving her the least aid, devoured her substance and
mine. I thought that in such a situation she ought to consider me as
her only friend and most sure protector, and that, far from making of
my own affairs a secret to me, and conspiring against me in my
house, it was her duty faithfully to acquaint me with everything in
which I was interested, when this came to her knowledge before it
did to mine. In what light, therefore, could I consider her false and
mysterious conduct? What could I think of the sentiments with which
she endeavored to inspire her daughter? What monstrous ingratitude
was hers, to endeavor to instil it into her from whom I expected my
greatest consolation?
These reflections at length alienated my affections from this
woman, and to such a degree that I could no longer look upon her
but with contempt. I nevertheless continued to treat with respect the
mother of the friend of my bosom, and in everything to show her
almost the reverence of a son; but I must confess I could not remain
long with her without pain, and that I never knew how to bear
restraint.
This is another short moment of my life, in which I approached
near to happiness without being able to attain it, and this by no fault
of my own. Had the mother been of a good disposition we all three
should have been happy to the end of our days; the longest liver only
would have been to be pitied. Instead of which, the reader will see
the course things took, and judge whether or not it was in my power
to change it.
Madam le Vasseur, who perceived I had got more full possession
of the heart of Theresa, and that she had lost ground with her,
endeavored to regain it; and instead of striving to restore herself to
my good opinion by the mediation of her daughter attempted to
alienate her affections from me. One of the means she employed
was to call her family to her aid. I had begged Theresa not to invite
any of her relations to the Hermitage, and she had promised me she
would not. These were sent for in my absence, without consulting

her, and she was afterwards prevailed upon to promise not to say
anything of the matter. After the first step was taken all the rest were
easy. When once we make a secret of anything to the person we
love, we soon make little scruple of doing it in everything; the
moment I was at the Chevrette the Hermitage was full of people who
sufficiently amused themselves. A mother has always great power
over a daughter of a mild disposition; yet notwithstanding all the old
woman could do, she was never able to prevail upon Theresa to
enter into her views, nor to persuade her to join in the league against
me. For her part, she resolved upon doing it forever, and seeing on
one side her daughter and myself, who were in a situation to live,
and that was all; on the other, Diderot, Grimm, D' Holbach and
Madam d'Epinay, who promised great things, and gave some little
ones, she could not conceive it was possible to be in the wrong with
the wife of a farmer-general and baron. Had I been more clear
sighted, I should from this moment have perceived I nourished a
serpent in my bosom. But my blind confidence, which nothing had
yet diminished, was such that I could not imagine she wished to
injure the person she ought to love. Though I saw numerous
conspiracies formed on every side, all I complain of was the tyranny
of persons who called themselves my friends, and who, as it
seemed, would force me to be happy in the manner they should
point out, and not in that I had chosen for myself.
Although Theresa refused to join in the confederacy with her
mother, she afterwards kept her secret. For this her motive was
commendable, although I will not determine whether she did it well
or ill. Two women, who have secrets between them, love to prattle
together; this attracted them towards each other, and Theresa, by
dividing herself, sometimes let me feel I was alone; for I could no
longer consider as a society that which we all three formed.
I now felt the neglect I had been guilty of during the first years of
our connection, in not taking advantage of the docility with which her
love inspired her, to improve her talents and give her knowledge,
which, by more closely connecting us in our retirement would
agreeably have filled up her time and my own, without once suffering
us to perceive the length of a private conversation. Not that this was
ever exhausted between us, or that she seemed disgusted with our

walks; but we had not a sufficient number of ideas common to both
to make ourselves a great store, and we could not incessantly talk of
our future projects which were confined to those of enjoying the
pleasures of life. The objects around us inspired me with reflections
beyond the reach of her comprehension. An attachment of twelve
years' standing had no longer need of words: we were too well
acquainted with each other to have any new knowledge to acquire in
that respect. The resource of puns, jests, gossiping and scandal,
was all that remained. In solitude especially is it, that the advantage
of living with a person who knows how to think is particularly felt. I
wanted not this resource to amuse myself with her; but she would
have stood in need of it to have always found amusement with me.
The worst of all was our being obliged to hold our conversations
when we could; her mother, who become importunate, obliged me to
watch for opportunities to do it. I was under constraint in my own
house: this is saying everything; the air of love was prejudicial to
good friendship. We had an intimate intercourse without living in
intimacy.
The moment I thought I perceived that Theresa sometimes sought
for a pretext to elude the walks I proposed to her, I ceased to invite
her to accompany me, without being displeased with her for not
finding in them so much amusement as I did. Pleasure is not a thing
which depends upon the will. I was sure of her heart, and the
possession of this was all I desired. As long as my pleasures were
hers, I tasted of them with her; when this ceased to be the case I
preferred her contentment to my own.
In this manner it was that, half deceived in my expectation, leading
a life after my own heart, in a residence I had chosen with a person
who was dear to me, I at length found myself almost alone. What I
still wanted prevented me from enjoying what I had. With respect to
happiness and enjoyment, everything or nothing, was what was
necessary to me. The reason of these observations will hereafter
appear. At present I return to the thread of my narrative.
I imagined that I possessed treasures in the manuscripts given me
by the Comte de St. Pierre. On examination I found they were a little
more than the collection of the printed works of his uncle, with notes
and corrections by his own hand, and a few other trifling fragments

which had not yet been published. I confirmed myself by these moral
writings in the idea I had conceived from some of his letters, shown
me by Madam de Crequi, that he had more sense and ingenuity than
at first I had imagined; but after a careful examination of his political
works, I discerned nothing but superficial notions, and projects that
were useful but impracticable, in consequence of the idea from
which the author never could depart, that men conducted
themselves by their sagacity rather than by their passions. The high
opinion he had of the knowledge of the moderns had made him
adopt this false principle of improved reason, the basis of all the
institutions he proposed, and the source of his political sophisms.
This extraordinary man, an honor to the age in which he lived, and to
the human species, and perhaps the only person, since the creation
of mankind, whose sole passion was that of reason, wandered in all
his systems from error to error, by attempting to make men like
himself, instead of taking them as they were, are, and will continue to
be. He labored for imaginary beings, while he thought himself
employed for the benefit of his contemporaries.
All these things considered, I was rather embarrassed as to the
form I should give to my work. To suffer the author's visions to pass
was doing nothing useful; fully to refute them would have been
unpolite, as the care of revising and publishing his manuscripts,
which I had accepted, and even requested, had been intrusted to
me; this trust had imposed on me the obligation of treating the author
honorably. I at length concluded upon that which to me appeared the
most decent, judicious, and useful. This was to give separately my
own ideas and those of the author, and, for this purpose, to enter into
his views, to set them in a new light, to amplify, extend them, and
spare nothing which might contribute to present them in all their
excellence.
My work therefore was to be composed of two parts absolutely
distinct: one, to explain, in the manner I have just mentioned, the
different projects of the author; in the other, which was not to appear
until the first had had its effect, I should have given my opinion upon
these projects, which I confess might sometimes have exposed them
to the fate of the sonnet of the misanthrope. At the head of the whole
was to have been the life of the author. For this I had collected some

good materials, and which I flattered myself I should not spoil in
making use of them. I had been a little acquainted with the Abbe de
St. Pierre, in his old age, and the veneration I had for his memory
warranted to me, upon the whole, that the comte would not be
dissatisfied with the manner in which I should have treated his
relation.
I made my first essay on the 'Perpetual Peace', the greatest and
most elaborate of all the works which composed the collection; and
before I abandoned myself to my reflections I had the courage to
read everything the abbe had written upon this fine subject, without
once suffering myself to be disgusted either by his slowness or his
repetitions. The public has seen the extract, on which account I have
nothing to say upon the subject. My opinion of it has not been
printed, nor do I know that it ever will be; however, it was written at
the same time the extract was made. From this I passed to the
'Polysynodie', or Plurality of Councils, a work written under the
regent to favor the administration he had chosen, and which caused
the Abbe de Saint Pierre to be expelled from the academy, on
account of some remarks unfavorable to the preceding
administration, and with which the Duchess of Maine and the
Cardinal de Polignac were displeased. I completed this work as I did
the former, with an extract and remarks; but I stopped here without
intending to continue the undertaking which I ought never to have
begun.
The reflection which induced me to give it up naturally presents
itself, and it was astonishing I had not made it sooner.
Most of the writings of the Abbe de Saint Pierre were either
observations, or contained observations, on some parts of the
government of France, and several of these were of so free a nature,
that it was happy for him he had made them with impunity. But in the
offices of all the ministers of state the Abbe de St. Pierre had ever
been considered as a kind of preacher rather than a real politician,
and he was suffered to say what he pleased, because it appeared
that nobody listened to him. Had I procured him readers the case
would have been different. He was a Frenchman, and I was not one;
and by repeating his censures, although in his own name, I exposed
myself to be asked, rather rudely, but without injustice, what it was

with which I meddled. Happily before I proceeded any further, I
perceived the hold I was about to give the government against me,
and I immediately withdrew. I knew that, living alone in the midst of
men more powerful than myself, I never could by any means
whatever be sheltered from the injury they chose to do me. There
was but one thing which depended upon my own efforts: this was, to
observe such a line of conduct that whenever they chose to make
me feel the weight of authority they could not do it without being
unjust. The maxim which induced me to decline proceeding with the
works of the Abbe de Saint Pierre, has frequently made me give up
projects I had much more at heart. People who are always ready to
construe adversity into a crime, would be much surprised were they
to know the pains I have taken, that during my misfortunes it might
never with truth be said of me, Thou hast deserved them.
After having given up the manuscript, I remained some time
without determining upon the work which should succeed it, and this
interval of inactivity was destructive; by permitting me to turn my
reflections on myself, for want of another object to engage my
attention. I had no project for the future which could amuse my
imagination. It was not even possible to form any, as my situation
was precisely that in which all my desires were united. I had not
another to conceive, and yet there was a void in my heart. This state
was the more cruel, as I saw no other that was to be preferred to it. I
had fixed my most tender affections upon a person who made me a
return of her own. I lived with her without constraint, and, so to
speak, at discretion. Notwithstanding this, a secret grief of mind
never quitted me for a moment, either when she was present or
absent. In possessing Theresa, I still perceived she wanted
something to her happiness; and the sole idea of my not being
everything to her had such an effect upon my mind that she was next
to nothing to me.
I had friends of both sexes, to whom I was attached by the purest
friendship and most perfect esteem; I depended upon a real return
on their part, and a doubt of their sincerity never entered my mind;
yet this friendship was more tormenting than agreeable to me, by
their obstinate perseverance and even by their affectation, in
opposing my taste, inclinations and manner of living; and this to such

a degree, that the moment I seemed to desire a thing which
interested myself only, and depended not upon them, they
immediately joined their efforts to oblige me to renounce it. This
continued desire to control me in all my wishes, the more unjust, as I
did not so much as make myself acquainted with theirs, became so
cruelly oppressive, that I never received one of their letters without
feeling a certain terror as I opened it, and which was but too well
justified by the contents. I thought being treated like a child by
persons younger than myself, and who, of themselves, stood in great
need of the advice they so prodigally bestowed on me, was too
much: "Love me," said I to them, "as I love you, but, in every other
respect, let my affairs be as indifferent to you, as yours are to me:
this is all I ask." If they granted me one of these two requests, it was
not the latter.
I had a retired residence in a charming solitude, was master of my
own house, and could live in it in the manner I thought proper,
without being controlled by any person. This habitation imposed on
me duties agreeable to discharge, but which were indispensable. My
liberty was precarious. In a greater state of subjection than a person
at the command of another, it was my duty to be so by inclination.
When I arose in the morning, I never could say to myself, I will
employ this day as I think proper. And, moreover, besides my being
subject to obey the call of Madam d'Epinay, I was exposed to the still
more disagreeable importunities of the public and chance comers.
The distance I was at from Paris did not prevent crowds of idlers, not
knowing how to spend their time, from daily breaking in upon me,
and, without the least scruple, freely disposing of mine. When I least
expected visitors I was unmercifully assailed by them, and I seldom
made a plan for the agreeable employment of the day that was not
counteracted by the arrival of some stranger.
In short, finding no real enjoyment in the midst of the pleasures I
had been most desirous to obtain, I, by sudden mental transitions,
returned in imagination to the serene days of my youth, and
sometimes exclaimed with a sigh: "Ah! this is not Les Charmettes!"
The recollection of the different periods of my life led me to reflect
upon that at which I was arrived, and I found I was already on the
decline, a prey to painful disorders, and imagined I was approaching

the end of my days without having, tasted, in all its plentitude,
scarcely anyone of the pleasures after which my heart had so much
thirsted, or having given scope to the lively sentiments I felt it had in
reserve. I had not favored even that intoxicating voluptuousness with
which my mind was richly stored, and which, for want of an object,
was always compressed, an never exhaled but by signs.
How was it possible that, with a mind naturally expansive, I, with
whom to live was to love, should not hitherto have found a friend
entirely devoted to me; a real friend: I who felt myself so capable of
being such a friend to another? How can it be accounted for that with
such warm affections, such combustible senses, and a heart wholly
made up of love, I had not once, at least, felt its flame for a
determinate object? Tormented by the want of loving, without ever
having been able to satisfy it, I perceived myself approaching the
eve of old age, and hastening on to death without having lived.
These melancholy but affecting recollections led me to others,
which, although accompanied with regret, were not wholly
unsatisfactory. I thought something I had not yet received was still
due to me from destiny.
To what end was I born with exquisite faculties? To suffer them to
remain unemployed? the sentiment of conscious merit, which made
me consider myself as suffering injustice, was some kind of
reparation, and caused me to shed tears which with pleasure I
suffered to flow.
These were my mediations during the finest season of the year, in
the month of June, in cool shades, to the songs of the nightingale,
and the warbling of brooks. Everything concurred in plunging me into
that too seducing state of indolence for which I was born, and from
which my austere manner, proceeding from a long effervescence,
should forever have delivered me. I unfortunately remembered the
dinner of the Chateau de Toune, and my meeting with the two
charming girls in the same season, in places much resembling that
in which I then was. The remembrance of these circumstances,
which the innocence that accompanied them rendered to me still
more dear, brought several others of the nature to my recollection. I
presently saw myself surrounded by all the objects which, in my
youth, had given me emotion. Mademoiselle Galley, Mademoiselle

de Graffenried, Mademoiselle de Breil, Madam Basile, Madam de
Larnage, my pretty scholars, and even the bewitching Zulietta, whom
my heart could not forget. I found myself in the midst of a seraglio of
houris of my old acquaintance, for whom the most lively inclination
was not new to me. My blood became inflamed, my head turned,
notwithstanding my hair was almost gray, and the grave citizen of
Geneva, the austere Jean Jacques, at forty-five years of age, again
became the fond shepherd. The intoxication, with which my mind
was seized, although sudden and extravagant, was so strong and
lasting, that, to enable me to recover from it, nothing less than the
unforeseen and terrible crisis it brought on was necessary.
This intoxication, to whatever degree it was carried, went not so
far as to make me forget my age and situation, to flatter me that I
could still inspire love, nor to make me attempt to communicate the
devouring flame by which ever since my youth I had felt my heart in
vain consumed. For this I did not hope; I did not even desire it. I
knew the season of love was past; I knew too well in what contempt
the ridiculous pretensions of superannuated gallants were held, ever
to add one to the number, and I was not a man to become an
impudent coxcomb in the decline of life, after having been so little
such during the flower of my age. Besides, as a friend to peace, I
should have been apprehensive of domestic dissensions; and I too
sincerely loved Theresa to expose her to the mortification of seeing
me entertain for others more lively sentiments than those with which
she inspired me for herself.
What step did I take upon this occasion? My reader will already
have guessed it, if he has taken the trouble to pay the least attention
to my narrative. The impossibility of attaining real beings threw me
into the regions of chimera, and seeing nothing in existence worthy
of my delirium, I sought food for it in the ideal world, which my
imagination quickly peopled with beings after my own heart. This
resource never came more apropos, nor was it ever so fertile. In my
continual ecstasy I intoxicated my mind with the most delicious
sentiments that ever entered the heart of man. Entirely forgetting the
human species, I formed to myself societies of perfect beings, whose
virtues were as celestial as their beauty, tender and faithful friends,
such as I never found here below. I became so fond of soaring in the

empyrean, in the midst of the charming objects with which I was
surrounded, that I thus passed hours and days without perceiving it;
and, losing the remembrance of all other things, I scarcely had eaten
a morsel in haste before I was impatient to make my escape and run
to regain my groves. When ready to depart for the enchanted world, I
saw arrive wretched mortals who came to detain me upon earth, I
could neither conceal nor moderate my vexation; and no longer
master of myself, I gave them so uncivil a reception, that it might
justly be termed brutal. This tended to confirm my reputation as a
misanthrope, from the very cause which, could the world have read
my heart, should have acquired me one of a nature directly opposite.
In the midst of my exultation I was pulled down like a paper kite,
and restored to my proper place by means of a smart attack of my
disorder. I recurred to the only means that had before given me
relief, and thus made a truce with my angelic amours; for besides
that it seldom happens that a man is amorous when he suffers, my
imagination, which is animated in the country and beneath the shade
of trees, languishes and becomes extinguished in a chamber, and
under the joists of a ceiling. I frequently regretted that there existed
no dryads; it would certainly have been amongst these that I should
have fixed my attachment.
Other domestic broils came at the same time to increase my
chagrin. Madam le Vasseur, while making me the finest compliments
in the world, alienated from me her daughter as much as she
possibly could. I received letters from my late neighborhood,
informing me that the good old lady had secretly contracted several
debts in the name of Theresa, to whom these became known, but of
which she had never mentioned to me a word. The debts to be paid
hurt me much less than the secret that had been made of them. How
could she, for whom I had never had a secret, have one from me? Is
it possible to dissimulate with persons whom we love? The 'Coterie
Holbachique', who found I never made a journey to Paris, began
seriously to be afraid I was happy and satisfied in the country, and
madman enough to reside there.
Hence the cabals by which attempts were made to recall me
indirectly to the city. Diderot, who did not immediately wish to show
himself, began by detaching from me De Leyre, whom I had brought

acquainted with him, and who received and transmitted to me the
impressions Diderot chose to give without suspecting to what end
they were directed.
Everything seemed to concur in withdrawing me from my charming
and mad reverie. I was not recovered from the late attack I had when
I received the copy of the poem on the destruction of Lisbon, which I
imagined to be sent by the author. This made it necessary I should
write to him and speak of his composition. I did so, and my letter was
a long time afterwards printed without my consent, as I shall
hereafter have occasion to remark.
Struck by seeing this poor man overwhelmed, if I may so speak,
with prosperity and honor, bitterly exclaiming against the miseries of
this life, and finding everything to be wrong, I formed the mad project
of making him turn his attention to himself, and of proving to him that
everything was right. Voltaire, while he appeared to believe in God,
never really believed in anything but the devil; since his pretended
deity is a malicious being, who, according to him, had no pleasure
but in evil. The glaring absurdity of this doctrine is particularly
disgusting from a man enjoying the greatest prosperity; who, from
the bosom of happiness, endeavors, by the frightful and cruel image
of all the calamities from which he is exempt, to reduce his fellow
creatures to despair. I, who had a better right than he to calculate
and weigh all the evils of human life, impartially examine them, and
proved to him that of all possible evils there was not one to be
attributed to Providence, and which had not its source rather in the
abusive use man made of his faculties than in nature. I treated him,
in this letter, with the greatest respect and delicacy possible. Yet,
knowing his self-love to be extremely irritable, I did not send the
letter immediately to himself, but to Doctor Tronchin, his physician
and friend, with full power either to give it him or destroy it. Voltaire
informed me in a few lines that being ill, having likewise the care of a
sick person, he postponed his answer until some future day, and
said not a word on the subject. Tronchin, when he sent me the letter,
inclosed in it another, in which he expressed but very little esteem for
the person from whom he received it.
I have never published, nor even shown, either of these two
letters, not liking to make a parade of such little triumphs; but the

originals are in my collections. Since that time Voltaire has published
the answer he promised me, but which I never received. This is the
novel of 'Candide', of which I cannot speak because I have not read
it.
All these interruptions ought to have cured me of my fantastic
amours, and they were perhaps the means offered me by Heaven to
prevent their destructive consequences; but my evil genius
prevailed, and I had scarcely begun to go out before my heart, my
head, and my feet returned to the same paths. I say the same in
certain respects; for my ideas, rather less exalted, remained this time
upon earth, but yet were busied in making so exquisite a choice of all
that was to be found there amiable of every kind, that it was not
much less chimerical than the imaginary world I had abandoned.
I figured to myself love and friendship, the two idols of my heart,
under the most ravishing images. I amused myself in adorning them
with all the charms of the sex I had always adored. I imagined two
female friends rather than two of my own sex, because, although the
example be more rare, it is also more amiable. I endowed them with
different characters, but analogous to their connection, with two
faces, not perfectly beautiful, but according to my taste, and
animated with benevolence and sensibility. I made one brown and
the other fair, one lively and the other languishing, one wise and the
other weak, but of so amiable a weakness that it seemed to add a
charm to virtue. I gave to one of the two a lover, of whom the other
was the tender friend, and even something more, but I did not admit
either rivalry, quarrels, or jealousy: because every painful sentiment
is painful for me to imagine, and I was unwilling to tarnish this
delightful picture by anything which was degrading to nature. Smitten
with my two charming models, I drew my own portrait in the lover
and the friend, as much as it was possible to do it; but I made him
young and amiable, giving him, at the same time, the virtues and the
defects which I felt in myself.
That I might place my characters in a residence proper for them, I
successively passed in review the most beautiful places I had seen
in my travels. But I found no grove sufficiently delightful, no
landscape that pleased me. The valleys of Thessaly would have
satisfied me had I but once had a sight of them; but my imagination,

fatigued with invention, wished for some real place which might
serve it as a point to rest upon, and create in me an illusion with
respect to the real existence of the inhabitants I intended to place
there. I thought a good while upon the Boromean Islands, the
delightful prospect of which had transported me, but I found in them
too much art and ornament for my lovers. I however wanted a lake,
and I concluded by making choice of that about which my heart has
never ceased to wander. I fixed myself upon that part of the banks of
this lake where my wishes have long since placed my residence in
the imaginary happiness to which fate has confined me. The native
place of my poor mamma had still for me a charm. The contrast of
the situations, the richness and variety of the sites, the magnificence,
the majesty of the whole, which ravishes the senses, affects, the
heart, and elevates the mind, determined me to give it the
preference, and I placed my young pupils at Vervey. This is what I
imagined at the first sketch; the rest was not added until afterwards.
I for a long time confined myself to this vague plan, because it was
sufficient to fill my imagination with agreeable objects, and my heart
with sentiments in which it delighted. These fictions, by frequently
presenting themselves, at length gained a consistence, and took in
my mind a determined form. I then had an inclination to express
upon paper some of the situations fancy presented to me, and,
recollecting everything I had felt during my youth, thus, in some
measure, gave an object to that desire of loving, which I had never
been able to satisfy, and by which I felt myself consumed.
I first wrote a few incoherent letters, and when I afterwards wished
to give them connection, I frequently found a difficulty in doing it.
What is scarcely credible, although most strictly true, is my having
written the first two parts almost wholly in this manner, without
having any plan formed, and not foreseeing I should one day be
tempted to make it a regular work. For this reason the two parts
afterwards formed of materials not prepared for the place in which
they are disposed, are full of unmeaning expressions not found in
the others.
In the midst of my reveries I had a visit from Madam d'Houdetot,
the first she had ever made me, but which unfortunately was not the
last, as will hereafter appear. The Comtesse d'Houdetot was the

daughter of the late M. de Bellegarde, a farmer-general, sister to M.
d'Epinay, and Messieurs de Lalive and De la Briche, both of whom
have since been introductors to ambassadors. I have spoken of the
acquaintance I made with her before she was married: since that
event I had not seen her, except at the fetes at La Chevrette, with
Madam d'Epinay, her sister-in-law. Having frequently passed several
days with her, both at La Chevrette and Epinay, I always thought her
amiable, and that she seemed to be my well-wisher. She was fond of
walking with me; we were both good walkers, and the conversation
between us was inexhaustible. However, I never went to see her in
Paris, although she had several times requested and solicited me to
do it. Her connections with M. de St. Lambert, with whom I began to
be intimate, rendered her more interesting to me, and it was to bring
me some account of that friend who was, I believe, then at Mahon,
that she came to see me at the Hermitage.
This visit had something of the appearance of the beginning of a
romance. She lost her way. Her coachman, quitting the road, which
turned to the right, attempted to cross straight over from the mill of
Clairvaux to the Hermitage: her carriage stuck in a quagmire in the
bottom of the valley, and she got out and walked the rest of the road.
Her delicate shoes were soon worn through; she sunk into the dirt,
her servants had the greatest difficulty in extricating her, and she at
length arrived at the Hermitage in boots, making the place resound
with her laughter, in which I most heartily joined. She had to change
everything. Theresa provided her with what was necessary, and I
prevailed upon her to forget her dignity and partake of a rustic
collation, with which she seemed highly satisfied. It was late, and her
stay was short; but the interview was so mirthful that it pleased her,
and she seemed disposed to return. She did not however put this
project into execution until the next year: but, alas! the delay was not
favorable to me in anything.
I passed the autumn in an employment no person would suspect
me of undertaking: this was guarding the fruit of M. d'Epinay. The
Hermitage was the reservoir of the waters of the park of the
Chevrette; there was a garden walled round and planted with
espaliers and other trees, which produced M. d'Epinay more fruit
than his kitchen-garden at the Chevrette, although three-fourths of it

were stolen from him. That I might not be a guest entirely useless, I
took upon myself the direction of the garden and the inspection of
the conduct of the gardener. Everything went on well until the fruit
season, but as this became ripe, I observed that it disappeared
without knowing in what manner it was disposed of. The gardener
assured me it was the dormice which eat it all. I destroyed a great
number of these animals, notwithstanding which the fruit still
diminished. I watched the gardener's motions so narrowly, that I
found he was the great dormouse. He lodged at Montmorency,
whence he came in the night with his wife and children to take away
the fruit he had concealed in the daytime, and which he sold in the
market at Paris as publicly as if he had brought it from a garden of
his own. The wretch whom I loaded with kindness, whose children
were clothed by Theresa, and whose father, who was a beggar, I
almost supported, robbed us with as much ease as effrontery, not
one of the three being sufficiently vigilant to prevent him: and one
night he emptied my cellar.
Whilst he seemed to address himself to me only, I suffered
everything, but being desirous of giving an account of the fruit, I was
obliged to declare by whom a great part of it had been stolen.
Madam d'Epinay desired me to pay and discharge him, and look out
for another; I did so. As this rascal rambled about the Hermitage in
the night, armed with a thick club staff with an iron ferrule, and
accompanied by other villains like himself, to relieve the
governesses from their fears, I made his successor sleep in the
house with us; and this not being sufficient to remove their
apprehensions, I sent to ask M. d'Epinay for a musket, which I kept
in the chamber of the gardener, with a charge not to make use of it
except an attempt was made to break open the door or scale the
walls of the garden, and to fire nothing but powder, meaning only to
frighten the thieves. This was certainly the least precaution a man
indisposed could take for the common safety of himself and family,
having to pass the winter in the midst of a wood, with two timid
women. I also procured a little dog to serve as a sentinel. De Leyre
coming to see me about this time, I related to him my situation, and
we laughed together at my military apparatus. At his return to Paris
he wished to amuse Diderot with the story, and by this means the

'Coterie d'Holbachique' learned that I was seriously resolved to pass
the winter at the Hermitage. This perseverance, of which they had
not imagined me to be capable, disconcerted them, and, until they
could think of some other means of making my residence
disagreeable to me, they sent back, by means of Diderot, the same
De Leyre, who, though at first he had thought my precautions quite
natural, now pretended to discover that they were inconsistent with
my principles, and styled them more than ridiculous in his letters, in
which he overwhelmed me with pleasantries sufficiently bitter and
satirical to offend me had I been the least disposed to take offence.
But at that time being full of tender and affectionate sentiments, and
not susceptible of any other, I perceived in his biting sarcasms
nothing more than a jest, and believed him only jocose when others
would have thought him mad.
By my care and vigilance I guarded the garden so well, that,
although there had been but little fruit that year the produce was
triple that of the preceding years; it is true, I spared no pains to
preserve it, and I went so far as to escort what I sent to the
Chevrette and to Epinay, and to carry baskets of it myself. The aunt
and I carried one of these, which was so heavy that we were obliged
to rest at every dozen steps, and which we arrived with it we were
quite wet with perspiration.
As soon as the bad season began to confine me to the house, I
wished to return to my indolent amusements, but this I found
impossible. I had everywhere two charming female friends before my
eyes, their friend, everything by which they were surrounded, the
country they inhabited, and the objects created or embellished for
them by my imagination. I was no longer myself for a moment, my
delirium never left me. After many useless efforts to banish all
fictions from my mind, they at length seduced me, and my future
endeavors were confined to giving them order and coherence, for
the purpose of converting them into a species of novel.
What embarrassed me most was, that I had contradicted myself
so openly and fully. After the severe principles I had just so publicly
asserted, after the austere maxims I had so loudly preached, and my
violent invectives against books, which breathed nothing but
effeminacy and love, could anything be less expected or more

extraordinary, than to see me, with my own hand, write my name in
the list of authors of those books I had so severely censured? I felt
this incoherence in all its extent. I reproached myself with it, I
blushed at it and was vexed; but all this could not bring me back to
reason. Completely overcome, I was at all risks obliged to submit,
and to resolve to brave the What will the world say of it? Except only
deliberating afterwards whether or not I should show my work, for I
did not yet suppose I should ever determine to publish it.
This resolution taken, I entirely abandoned myself to my reveries,
and, by frequently resolving these in my mind, formed with them the
kind of plan of which the execution has been seen. This was
certainly the greatest advantage that could be drawn from my follies;
the love of good which has never once been effaced from my heart,
turned them towards useful objects, the moral of which might have
produced its good effects. My voluptuous descriptions would have
lost all their graces, had they been devoid of the coloring of
innocence.
A weak girl is an object of pity, whom love may render interesting,
and who frequently is not therefore the less amiable; but who can
see without indignation the manners of the age; and what is more
disgusting than the pride of an unchaste wife, who, openly treading
under foot every duty, pretends that her husband ought to be grateful
for her unwillingness to suffer herself to be taken in the fact? Perfect
beings are not in nature, and their examples are not near enough to
us. But whoever says that the description of a young person born
with good dispositions, and a heart equally tender and virtuous, who
suffers herself, when a girl, to be overcome by love, and when a
woman, has resolution enough to conquer in her turn, is upon the
whole scandalous and useless, is a liar and a hypocrite; hearken not
to him.
Besides this object of morality and conjugal chastity which is
radically connected with all social order, I had in view one more
secret in behalf of concord and public peace, a greater, and perhaps
more important object in itself, at least for the moment for which it
was created. The storm brought on by the 'Encyclopedie', far from
being appeased, was at the time at its height. Two parties
exasperated against each other to the last degree of fury soon

resembled enraged wolves, set on for their mutual destruction, rather
than Christians and philosophers, who had a reciprocal wish to
enlighten and convince each other, and lead their brethren to the
way of truth. Perhaps nothing more was wanting to each party than a
few turbulent chiefs, who possessed a little power, to make this
quarrel terminate in a civil war; and God only knows what a civil war
of religion founded on each side upon the most cruel intolerance
would have produced. Naturally an enemy to all spirit of party, I had
freely spoken severe truths to each, of which they had not listened. I
thought of another expedient, which, in my simplicity, appeared to
me admirable: this was to abate their reciprocal hatred by destroying
their prejudices, and showing to each party the virtue and merit
which in the other was worthy of public esteem and respect. This
project, little remarkable for its wisdom, which supported sincerity in
mankind, and whereby I fell into the error with which I reproached
the Abbe de Saint Pierre, had the success that was to be expected
from it: It drew together and united the parties for no other purpose
than that of crushing the author. Until experience made me discover
my folly, I gave my attention to it with a zeal worthy of the motive by
which I was inspired; and I imagined the two characters of Wolmar
and Julia in an ecstasy, which made me hope to render them both
amiable, and, what is still more, by means of each other.
Satisfied with having made a rough sketch of my plan, I returned
to the situations in detail, which I had marked out; and from the
arrangement I gave them resulted the first two parts of the Eloisa,
which I finished during the winter with inexpressible pleasure,
procuring gilt-paper to receive a fair copy of them, azure and silver
powder to dry the writing, and blue narrow ribbon to tack my sheets
together; in a word, I thought nothing sufficiently elegant and delicate
for my two charming girls, of whom, like another Pygmalion, I
became madly enamoured. Every evening, by the fireside, I read the
two parts to the governesses. The daughter, without saying a word,
was like myself moved to tenderness, and we mingled our sighs; her
mother, finding there were no compliments, understood nothing of
the matter, remained unmoved, and at the intervals when I was silent
always repeated: "Sir, that is very fine."

Madam d'Epinay, uneasy at my being alone, in winter, in a solitary
house, in the midst of woods, often sent to inquire after my health. I
never had such real proofs of her friendship for me, to which mine
never more fully answered. It would be wrong in me were not I,
among these proofs, to make special mention of her portrait, which
she sent me, at the same time requesting instructions from me in
what manner she might have mine, painted by La Tour, and which
had been shown at the exhibition. I ought equally to speak of another
proof of her attention to me, which, although it be laughable, is a
feature in the history of my character, on account of the impression
received from it. One day when it froze to an extreme degree, in
opening a packet she had sent me of several things I had desired
her to purchase for me, I found a little under-petticoat of English
flannel, which she told me she had worn, and desired I would make
of it an under-waistcoat.
This care, more than friendly, appeared to me so tender, and as if
she had stripped herself to clothe me, that in my emotion I
repeatedly kissed, shedding tears at the same time, both the note
and the petticoat. Theresa thought me mad. It is singular that of all
the marks of friendship Madam d'Epinay ever showed me this
touched me the most, and that ever since our rupture I have never
recollected it without being very sensibly affected. I for a long time
preserved her little note, and it would still have been in my
possession had not it shared the fate of my other notes received at
the same period.
Although my disorder then gave me but little respite in winter, and
a part of the interval was employed in seeking relief from pain, this
was still upon the whole the season which since my residence in
France I had passed with most pleasure and tranquillity. During four
or five months, whilst the bad weather sheltered me from the
interruptions of importunate visits, I tasted to a greater degree than I
had ever yet or have since done, of that equal simple and
independent life, the enjoyment of which still made it more desirable
to me; without any other company than the two governesses in
reality, and the two female cousins in idea. It was then especially that
I daily congratulated myself upon the resolution I had had the good
sense to take, unmindful of the clamors of my friends, who were

vexed at seeing me delivered from their tyranny; and when I heard of
the attempt of a madman, when De Leyre and Madam d'Epinay
spoke to me in letters of the trouble and agitation which reigned in
Paris, how thankful was I to Heaven for having placed me at a
distance from all such spectacles of horror and guilt. These would
have been continued and increased the bilious humor which the
sight of public disorders had given me; whilst seeing nothing around
me in my retirement but gay and pleasing objects, my heart was
wholly abandoned to sentiments which were amiable.
I remark here with pleasure the course of the last peaceful
moments that were left me. The spring succeeding to this winter,
which had been so calm, developed the germ of the misfortunes I
have yet to describe; in the tissue of which, alike interval, wherein I
had leisure to respite, will not be found.
I think however, I recollect, that during this interval of peace, and in
the bosom of my solitude, I was not quite undisturbed by the
Holbachiens. Diderot stirred me up some strife, and I am much
deceived if it was not in the course of this winter that the 'Fils
Naturel'--[Natural Son]--of which I shall soon have occasion to
speak, made its appearance. Independently of the causes which left
me but few papers relative to that period, those even which I have
been able to preserve are not very exact with respect to dates.
Diderot never dated his letters--Madam d'Epinay and Madam d'
Houdetot seldom dated theirs except the day of the week, and De
Leyre mostly confined himself to the same rules. When I was
desirous of putting these letters in order I was obliged to supply what
was wanting by guessing at dates, so uncertain that I cannot depend
upon them. Unable therefore to fix with certainty the beginning of
these quarrels, I prefer relating in one subsequent article everything I
can recollect concerning them.
The return of spring had increased my amorous delirium, and in
my melancholy, occasioned by the excess of my transports, I had
composed for the last parts of Eloisa several letters, wherein evident
marks of the rapture in which I wrote them are found. Amongst
others I may quote those from the Elysium, and the excursion upon
the lake, which, if my memory does not deceive me, are at the end of
the fourth part. Whoever, in reading these letters, does not feel his

heart soften and melt into the tenderness by which they were
dictated, ought to lay down the book: nature has refused him the
means of judging of sentiment.
Precisely at the same time I received a second unforeseen visit
from Madam d'Houdetot, in the absence of her husband, who was
captain of the Gendarmarie, and of her lover, who was also in the
service. She had come to Eaubonne, in the middle of the Valley of
Montmorency, where she had taken a pretty house, from thence she
made a new excursion to the Hermitage. She came on horseback,
and dressed in men's clothes. Although I am not very fond of this
kind of masquerade, I was struck with the romantic appearance she
made, and, for once, it was with love. As this was the first and only
time in all my life, the consequence of which will forever render it
terrible to my remembrance, I must take the permission to enter into
some particulars on the subject.
The Countess d'Houdetot was nearly thirty years of age, and not
handsome; her face was marked with the smallpox, her complexion
coarse, she was short-sighted, and her eyes were rather round; but
she had fine long black hair, which hung down in natural curls below
her waist; her figure was agreeable, and she was at once both
awkward and graceful in her motions; her wit was natural and
pleasing; to this gayety, heedlessness and ingenuousness were
perfectly suited: she abounded in charming sallies, after which she
so little sought, that they sometimes escaped her lips in spite of
herself. She possessed several agreeable talents, played the
harpsichord, danced well, and wrote pleasing poetry. Her character
was angelic--this was founded upon a sweetness of mind, and
except prudence and fortitude, contained in it every virtue. She was
besides so much to be depended upon in all intercourse, so faithful
in society, even her enemies were not under the necessity of
concealing from her their secrets. I mean by her enemies the men,
or rather the women, by whom she was not beloved; for as to herself
she had not a heart capable of hatred, and I am of opinion this
conformity with mine greatly contributed towards inspiring me with a
passion for her. In confidence of the most intimate friendship, I never
heard her speak ill of persons who were absent, nor even of her
sister-in-law. She could neither conceal her thoughts from anyone,

nor disguise any of her sentiments, and I am persuaded she spoke
of her lover to her husband, as she spoke of him to her friends and
acquaintances, and to everybody without distinction of persons.
What proved, beyond all manner of doubt, the purity and sincerity of
her nature was, that subject to very extraordinary absences of mind,
and the most laughable inconsiderateness, she was often guilty of
some very imprudent ones with respect to herself, but never in the
least offensive to any person whatsoever.
She had been married very young and against her inclinations to
the Comte d'Houdetot, a man of fashion, and a good officer; but a
man who loved play and chicane, who was not very amiable, and
whom she never loved. She found in M. de Saint Lambert all the
merit of her husband, with more ageeeable qualities of mind, joined
with virtue and talents. If anything in the manners of the age can be
pardoned, it is an attachment which duration renders more pure, to
which its effects do honor, and which becomes cemented by
reciprocal esteem. It was a little from inclination, as I am disposed to
think, but much more to please Saint Lambert, that she came to see
me. He had requested her to do it, and there was reason to believe
the friendship which began to be established between us would
render this society agreeable to all three. She knew I was acquainted
with their connection, and as she could speak to me without
restraint, it was natural she should find my conversation agreeable.
She came; I saw her; I was intoxicated with love without an object;
this intoxication fascinated my eyes; the object fixed itself upon her. I
saw my Julia in Madam d'Houdetot, and I soon saw nothing but
Madam d'Houdetot, but with all the perfections with which I had just
adorned the idol of my heart. To complete my delirium she spoke to
me of Saint Lambert with a fondness of a passionate lover.
Contagious force of love! while listening to her, and finding myself
near her, I was seized with a delicious trembling, which I had never
before experienced when near to any person whatsoever. She
spoke, and I felt myself affected; I thought I was nothing more than
interested in her sentiments, when I perceived I possessed those
which were similar; I drank freely of the poisoned cup, of which I yet
tasted nothing more than the sweetness. Finally, imperceptibly to us
both, she inspired me for herself with all she expressed for her lover.

Alas! it was very late in life, and cruel was it to consume with a
passion not less violent than unfortunate for a woman whose heart
was already in the possession of another.
Notwithstanding the extraordinary emotions I had felt when near to
her, I did not at first perceive what had happened to me; it was not
until after her departure that, wishing to think of Julia, I was struck
with surprise at being unable to think of anything but Madam d'
Houdetot. Then was it my eyes were opened: I felt my misfortune,
and lamented what had happened, but I did not foresee the
consequences.
I hesitated a long time on the manner in which I should conduct
myself towards her, as if real love left behind it sufficient reason to
deliberate and act accordingly. I had not yet determined upon this
when she unexpectedly returned and found me unprovided. It was
this time, perfectly acquainted with my situation, shame, the
companion of evil, rendered me dumb, and made me tremble in her
presence; I neither dared to open my mouth or raise my eyes; I was
in an inexpressible confusion which it was impossible she should not
perceive. I resolved to confess to her my troubled state of mind, and
left her to guess the cause whence it proceeded: this was telling her
in terms sufficiently clear.
Had I been young and amiable, and Madam d' Houdetot,
afterwards weak, I should here blame her conduct; but this was not
the case, and I am obliged to applaud and admire it. The resolution
she took was equally prudent and generous. She could not suddenly
break with me without giving her reasons for it to Saint Lambert, who
himself had desired her to come and see me; this would have
exposed two friends to a rupture, and perhaps a public one, which
she wished to avoid. She had for me esteem and good wishes; she
pitied my folly without encouraging it, and endeavored to restore me
to reason. She was glad to preserve to her lover and herself a friend
for whom she had some respect; and she spoke of nothing with
more pleasure than the intimate and agreeable society we might
form between us three the moment I should become reasonable.
She did not always confine herself to these friendly exhortations,
and, in case of need, did not spare me more severe reproaches,
which I had richly deserved.

I spared myself still less: the moment I was alone I began to
recover; I was more calm after my declaration--love, known to the
person by whom it is inspired, becomes more supportable.
The forcible manner in which I approached myself with mine,
ought to have cured me of it had the thing been possible. What
powerful motives did I not call to my mind to stifle it? My morals,
sentiments and principles; the shame, the treachery and crime, of
abusing what was confided to friendship, and the ridiculousness of
burning, at my age, with the most extravagant passion for an object
whose heart was preengaged, and who could neither make me a
return, nor least hope; moreover with a passion which, far from
having anything to gain by constancy, daily became less sufferable.
We would imagine that the last consideration which ought to have
added weight to all the others, was that whereby I eluded them!
What scruple, thought I, ought I to make of a folly prejudicial to
nobody but myself? Am I then a young man of whom Madam
d'Houdetot ought to be afraid? Would not it be said by my
presumptive remorse that, by my gallantry, manner and dress, I was
going to seduce her? Poor Jean Jacques, love on at thy ease, in all
safety of conscience, and be not afraid that thy sighs will be
prejudicial to Saint Lambert.
It has been seen that I never was a coxcomb, not even in my
youth. The manner of thinking, of which I have spoken, was
according to my turn of mind, it flattered my passions; this, was
sufficient to induce me to abandon myself to it without reserve, and
to laugh even at the impertinent scruple I thought I had made from
vanity, rather than from reason. This is a great lesson for virtuous
minds, which vice never attacks openly; it finds means to surprise
them by masking itself with sophisms, and not unfrequently with a
virtue.
Guilty without remorse, I soon became so without measure; and I
entreat it may be observed in what manner my passion followed my
nature, at length to plunge me into an abyss. In the first place, it
assumed the air of humility to encourage me; and to render me
intrepid it carried this humility even to mistrust. Madam d'Houdetot
incessantly putting in mind of my duty, without once for a single
moment flattering my folly, treated me with the greatest mildness,

and remained with me upon the footing of the most tender friendship.
This friendship would, I protest, have satisfied my wishes, had I
thought it sincere; but finding it too strong to be real, I took it into my
head that love, so ill-suited to my age and appearance, had rendered
me contemptible in the eyes of Madam d'Houdetot; that this young
mad creature only wished to divert herself with me and my
superannuated passion; that she had communicated this to Saint
Lambert; and that the indignation caused by my breach of friendship,
having made her lover enter into her views, they were agreed to turn
my head and then to laugh at me. This folly, which at twenty-six
years of age, had made me guilty of some extravagant behavior to
Madam de Larnage, whom I did not know, would have been
pardonable in me at forty-five with Madam d' Houdetot had not I
known that she and her lover were persons of too much uprightness
to indulge themselves in such a barbarous amusement.
Madam d' Houdetot continued her visits, which I delayed not to
return. She, as well as myself, was fond of walking, and we took long
walks in an enchanting country. Satisfied with loving and daring to
say I loved, I should have been in the most agreeable situation had
not my extravagance spoiled all the charm of it. She, at first, could
not comprehend the foolish pettishness with which I received her
attentions; but my heart, incapable of concealing what passed in it,
did not long leave her ignorant of my suspicions; she endeavored to
laugh at them, but this expedient did not succeed; transports of rage
would have been the consequence, and she changed her tone. Her
compassionate gentleness was invincible; she made me reproaches,
which penetrated my heart; she expressed an inquietude at my
unjust fears, of which I took advantage. I required proofs of her being
in earnest. She perceived there was no other means of relieving me
from my apprehensions. I became pressing: the step was delicate. It
is astonishing, and perhaps without example, that a woman having
suffered herself to be brought to hesitate should have got herself off
so well. She refused me nothing the most tender friendship could
grant; yet she granted me nothing that rendered her unfaithful, and I
had the mortification to see that the disorder into which the most
trifling favors had thrown all my senses had not the least effect upon
hers.

I have somewhere said, that nothing should be granted to the
senses, when we wished to refuse them anything. To prove how
false this maxim was relative to Madam d' Houdetot, and how far she
was right to depend upon her own strength of mind, it would be
necessary to enter into the detail of our long and frequent
conversations, and follow them, in all their liveliness during the four
months we passed together in an intimacy almost without example
between two friends of different sexes who contain themselves
within the bounds which we never exceeded. Ah! if I had lived so
long without feeling the power of real love, my heart and senses
abundantly paid the arrears. What, therefore, are the transports we
feel with the object of our affections by whom we are beloved, since
the passions of which my idol did not partake inspired such as I felt?
But I am wrong in saying Madam Houdetot did not partake of the
passion of love; that which I felt was in some measure confined to
myself; yet love was equal on both sides, but not reciprocal. We
were both intoxicated with the passion, she for her lover, and I for
herself; our sighs and delicious tears were mingled together. Tender
confidants of the secrets of each other, there was so great a
similarity in our sentiments that it was impossible they should not find
some common point of union. In the midst of this delicious
intoxication, she never forgot herself for a moment, and I solemnly
protest that, if ever, led away by my senses, I have attempted to
render her unfaithful, I was never really desirous of succeeding. The
vehemence itself of my passion restrained it within bounds. The duty
of self-denial had elevated my mind. The lustre of every virture
adorned in my eyes the idol of my heart; to have soiled their divine
image would have been to destroy it. I might have committed the
crime; it has been a hundred times committed in my heart; but to
dishonor my Sophia! Ah! was this ever possible? No! I have told her
a hundred times it was not. Had I had it in my power to satisfy my
desires, had she consented to commit herself to my discretion, I
should, except in a few moments of delirium, have refused to be
happy at the price of her honor. I loved her too well to wish to
possess her.
The distance from the Hermitage to Raubonne is almost a league;
in my frequent excursions to it I have sometimes slept there. One

evening after having supped tete-a-tete we went to walk in the
garden by a fine moonlight. At the bottom of the garden a
considerable copse, through which we passed on our way to a pretty
grove ornamented with a cascade, of which I had given her the idea,
and she had procured it to be executed accordingly.
Eternal remembrance of innocence and enjoyment! It was in this
grove that, seated by her side upon a seat of turf under an acacia in
full bloom, I found for the emotions of my heart a language worthy of
them. It was the first and only time of my life; but I was sublime: if
everything amiable and seducing with which the most tender and
ardent love can inspire the heart of man can be so called. What
intoxicating tears did I shed upon her knees! how many did I make
her to shed involuntarily! At length in an involuntary transport she
exclaimed: "No, never was a man so amiable, nor ever was there
one who loved like you! But your friend Saint Lambert hears us, and
my heart is incapable of loving twice." I exhausted myself with sighs;
I embraced her--what an embrace! But this was all. She had lived
alone for the last six months, that is absent from her husband and
lover; I had seen her almost every day during three months, and love
seldom failed to make a third. We had supped tete-a-tete, we were
alone, in the grove by moonlight, and after two hours of the most
lively and tender conversation, she left this grove at midnight, and
the arms of her lover, as morally and physically pure as she had
entered it. Reader, weigh all these circumstances; I will add nothing
more.
Do not, however, imagine that in this situation my passions left me
as undisturbed as I was with Theresa and mamma. I have already
observed I was this time inspired not only with love, but with love and
all its energy and fury. I will not describe either the agitations,
tremblings, palpitations, convulsionary emotions, nor faintings of the
heart, I continually experienced; these may be judged of by the effect
her image alone made upon me. I have observed the distance from
the Hermitage to Eaubonne was considerable; I went by the hills of
Andilly, which are delightful; I mused, as I walked, on her whom I
was going to see, the charming reception she would give me, and
upon the kiss which awaited me at my arrival. This single kiss, this
pernicious embrace, even before I received it, inflamed my blood to

such a degree as to affect my head, my eyes were dazzled, my
knees trembled, and were unable to support me; I was obliged to
stop and sit down; my whole frame was in inconceivable disorder,
and I was upon the point of fainting. Knowing the danger, I
endeavored at setting out to divert my attention from the object, and
think of something else. I had not proceeded twenty steps before the
same recollection, and all that was the consequence of it, assailed
me in such a manner that it was impossible to avoid them, and in
spite of all my efforts I do not believe I ever made this little excursion
alone with impunity. I arrived at Eaubonne, weak, exhausted, and
scarcely able to support myself. The moment I saw her everything
was repaired; all I felt in her presence was the importunity of an
inexhaustible and useless ardor. Upon the road to Raubonne there
was a pleasant terrace called Mont Olympe, at which we sometimes
met. I arrived first, it was proper I should wait for her; but how dear
this waiting cost me! To divert my attention, I endeavored to write
with my pencil billets, which I could have written with the purest
drops of my blood; I never could finish one which was eligible. When
she found a note in the niche upon which we had agreed, all she
learned from the contents was the deplorable state in which I was
when I wrote it. This state and its continuation, during three months
of irritation and self-denial, so exhausted me, that I was several
years before I recovered from it, and at the end of these it left me an
ailment which I shall carry with me, or which will carry me to the
grave. Such was the sole enjoyment of a man of the most
combustible constitution, but who was, at the same time, perhaps,
one of the most timid mortals nature ever produced. Such were the
last happy days I can reckon upon earth; at the end of these began
the long train of evils, in which there will be found but little
interruption.
It has been seen that, during the whole course of my life, my heart,
as transparent as crystal, has never been capable of concealing for
the space of a moment any sentiment in the least lively which had
taken refuge in it. It will therefore be judged whether or not it was
possible for me long to conceal my affection for Madam d'Houdetot.
Our intimacy struck the eyes of everybody, we did not make of it
either a secret or a mystery. It was not of a nature to require any

such precaution, and as Madam d'Houdetot had for me the most
tender friendship with which she did not reproach herself, and I for
her an esteem with the justice of which nobody was better
acquainted than myself; she frank, absent, heedless; I true,
awkward, haughty, impatient and choleric; We exposed ourselves
more in deceitful security than we should have done had we been
culpable. We both went to the Chevrette; we sometimes met there
by appointment. We lived there according to our accustomed
manner; walking together every day talking of our amours, our
duties, our friend, and our innocent projects; all this in the park
opposite the apartment of Madam d'Epinay, under her windows,
whence incessantly examining us, and thinking herself braved, she
by her eyes filled her heart with rage and indignation.
Women have the art of concealing their anger, especially when it
is great. Madam d'Epinay, violent but deliberate, possessed this art
to an eminent degree. She feigned not to see or suspect anything,
and at the same time that she doubled towards me her cares,
attention, and allurements, she affected to load her sister-in-law with
incivilities and marks of disdain, which she seemingly wished to
communicate to me. It will easily be imagined she did not succeed;
but I was on the rack. Torn by opposite passions, at the same time
that I was sensible of her caresses, I could scarcely contain my
anger when I saw her wanting in good manners to Madam
d'Houdetot. The angelic sweetness of this lady made her endure
everything without complaint, or even without being offended.
She was, in fact, so absent, and always so little attentive to these
things, that half the time she did not perceive them.
I was so taken up with my passion, that, seeing nothing but Sophia
(one of the names of Madam d'Houdetot),I did not perceive that I
was become the laughing-stock of the whole house, and all those
who came to it. The Baron d'Holbach, who never, as I heard of, had
been at the Chevrette, was one of the latter. Had I at that time been
as mistrustful as I am since become, I should strongly have
suspected Madam d'Epinay to have contrived this journey to give the
baron the amusing spectacle of an amorous citizen. But I was then
so stupid that I saw not that even which was glaring to everybody.
My stupidity did not, however, prevent me from finding in the baron a

more jovial and satisfied appearance than ordinary. Instead of
looking upon me with his usual moroseness, he said to me a
hundred jocose things without my knowing what he meant. Surprise
was painted in my countenance, but I answered not a word: Madam
d'Epinay shook her sides with laughing; I knew not what possessed
them. As nothing yet passed the bounds of pleasantry, the best thing
I could had done, had I been in the secret, would have been to have
humored the joke. It is true I perceived amid the rallying gayety of
the baron, that his eyes sparkled with a malicious joy, which could
have given me pain had I then remarked it to the degree it has since
occurred to my recollection.
One day when I went to see Madam d'Houdetot, at Eaubonne,
after her return from one of her journeys to Paris, I found her
melancholy, and observed that she had been weeping. I was obliged
to put a restraint on myself, because Madam de Blainville, sister to
her husband, was present; but the moment I found an opportunity, I
expressed to her my uneasiness. "Ah," said she, with a sigh, "I am
much afraid your follies will cost me the repose of the rest of my
days. St. Lambert has been informed of what has passed, and ill
informed of it. He does me justice, but he is vexed; and what is still
worse, he conceals from me a part of his vexation. Fortunately I
have not concealed from him anything relative to our connection
which was formed under his auspices. My letters, like my heart, were
full of yourself; I made him acquainted with everything, except your
extravagant passion, of which I hoped to cure you; and which he
imputes to me as a crime. Somebody has done us ill offices. I have
been injured, but what does this signify? Either let us entirely break
with each other, or do you be what you ought to be. I will not in future
have anything to conceal from my lover."
This was the first moment in which I was sensible of the shame of
feeling myself humbled by the sentiment of my fault, in presence of a
young woman of whose just reproaches I approved, and to whom I
ought to have been a mentor. The indignation I felt against myself
would, perhaps, have been sufficient to overcome my weakness,
had not the tender passion inspired me by the victim of it, again
softened my heart. Alas! was this a moment to harden it when it was
overflowed by the tears which penetrated it in every part? This

tenderness was soon changed into rage against the vile informers,
who had seen nothing but the evil of a criminal but involuntary
sentiment, without believing or even imagining the sincere
uprightness of heart by which it was counteracted. We did not
remain long in doubt about the hand by which the blow was directed.
We both knew that Madam d'Epinay corresponded with St.
Lambert. This was not the first storm she had raised up against
Madam d'Houdetot, from whom she had made a thousand efforts to
detach her lover, the success of some of which made the
consequences to be dreaded. Besides, Grimm, who, I think, had
accompanied M. de Castries to the army, was in Westphalia, as well
as Saint Lambert; they sometimes visited. Grimm had made some
attempts on Madam d'Houdetot, which had not succeeded, and
being extremely piqued, suddenly discontinued his visits to her. Let it
be judged with what calmness, modest as he is known to be, he
supposed she preferred to him a man older than himself, and of
whom, since he had frequented the great, he had never spoken but
as a person whom he patronized.
My suspicions of Madam d'Epinay were changed into a certainty
the moment I heard what had passed in my own house. When I was
at the Chevrette, Theresa frequently came there, either to bring me
letters or to pay me that attention which my ill state of health
rendered necessary. Madam d'Epinay had asked her if Madam
d'Houdetot and I did not write to each other. Upon her answering in
the affirmative, Madam d'Epinay pressed her to give her the letters of
Madam d'Houdetot, assuring her that she would reseal them in such
a manner as it should never be known. Theresa, without showing
how much she was shocked at the proposition, and without even
putting me upon my guard, did nothing more than seal the letters she
brought me more carefully; a lucky precaution, for Madam d'Epinay
had her watched when she arrived, and, waiting for her in the
passage, several times carried her audaciousness as far as to
examine her tucker. She did more even than this: having one day
invited herself with M. de Margency to dinner at the Hermitage, for
the first time since I resided there, she seized the moment I was
walking with Margency to go into my closet with the mother and
daughter, and to press them to show her the letters of Madam

d'Houdetot. Had the mother known where the letters were, they
would have been given to her; fortunately, the daughter was the only
person who was in the secret, and denied my having preserved any
one of them. A virtuous, faithful and generous falsehood; whilst truth
would have been a perfidy. Madam d' Epinay, perceiving Theresa
was not to be seduced, endeavored to irritate her by jealousy,
reproaching her with her easy temper and blindness. "How is it
possible," said she to her, "you cannot perceive there is a criminal
intercourse between them? If besides what strikes your eyes you
stand in need of other proofs, lend your assistance to obtain that
which may furnish them; you say he tears the letters from Madam
d'Houdetot as soon as he has read them. Well, carefully gather up
the pieces and give them to me; I will take upon myself to put them
together."
Such were the lessons my friend gave to the partner of my bed.
Theresa had the discretion to conceal from me, for a considerable
time, all these attempts; but perceiving how much I was perplexed,
she thought herself obliged to inform me of everything, to the end
that knowing with whom I had to do, I might take my measures
accordingly. My rage and indignation are not to be described.
Instead of dissembling with Madam d'Epinay, according to her own
example, and making use of counterplots, I abandoned myself
without reserve to the natural impetuosity of my temper; and with my
accustomed inconsiderateness came to an open rupture. My
imprudence will be judged of by the following letters, which
sufficiently show the manner of proceeding of both parties on this
occasion:
NOTE FROM MADAM D'EPINAY. "Why, my dear friend, do I not
see you? You make me uneasy. You have so often promised me to
do nothing but go and come between this place and the Hermitage!
In this I have left you at liberty; and you have suffered a week to
pass without coming. Had not I been told you were well I should
have imagined the contrary. I expected you either the day before
yesterday, or yesterday, but found myself disappointed. My God,
what is the matter with you? You have no business, nor can you
have any uneasiness; for had this been the case, I flatter myself you
would have come and communicated it to me. You are, therefore, ill!

Relieve me, I beseech you, speedily from my fears. Adieu, my dear
friend: let this adieu produce me a good-morning from you."
ANSWER. "I cannot yet say anything to you. I wait to be better
informed, and this I shall be sooner or later. In the meantime be
persuaded that innocence will find a defender sufficiently powerful to
cause some repentance in the slanderers, be they who they may."
SECOND NOTE FROM THE SAME. "Do you know that your letter
frightens me? What does it mean? I have read it twenty times. In
truth I do not understand what it means. All I can perceive is, that
you are uneasy and tormented, and that you wait until you are no
longer so before you speak to me upon the subject. Is this, my dear
friend, what we agreed upon? What then is become of that friendship
and confidence, and by what means have I lost them? Is it with me
or for me that you are angry? However this may be, come to me this
evening I conjure you; remember you promised me no longer than a
week ago to let nothing remain upon your mind, but immediately to
communicate to me whatever might make it uneasy. My dear friend, I
live in that confidence--There--I have just read your letter again; I do
not understand the contents better, but they make me tremble. You
seem to be cruelly agitated. I could wish to calm your mind, but as I
am ignorant of the cause whence your uneasiness arises, I know not
what to say, except that I am as wretched as yourself, and shall
remain so until we meet. If you are not here this evening at six
o'clock, I set off to morrow for the Hermitage, let the weather be how
it will, and in whatever state of health I may be; for I can no longer
support the inquietude I now feel. Good day, my dear friend, at all
risks I take the liberty to tell you, without knowing whether or not you
are in need of such advice, to endeavor to stop the progress
uneasiness makes in solitude. A fly be comes a monster. I have
frequently experienced it."
ANSWER. "I can neither come to see you nor receive your visit so
long as my present inquietude continues. The confidence of which
you speak no longer exists, and it will be easy for you to recover it. I
see nothing more in your present anxiety than the desire of drawing
from the confessions of others some advantage agreeable to your
views; and my heart, so ready to pour its overflowings into another
which opens itself to receive them, is shut against trick and cunning.

I distinguish your ordinary address in the difficulty you find in
understanding my note. Do you think me dupe enough to believe you
have not comprehended what it meant? No: but I shall know how to
overcome your subtleties by my frankness. I will explain myself more
clearly, that you may understand me still less.
"Two lovers closely united and worthy of each other's love are
dear to me; I expect you will not know who I mean unless I name
them. I presume attempts have been made to disunite them, and
that I have been made use of to inspire one of the two with jealousy.
The choice was not judicious, but it appeared convenient to the
purposes of malice, and of this malice it is you whom I suspect to be
guilty. I hope this becomes more clear.
"Thus the woman whom I most esteem would, with my knowledge,
have been loaded with the infamy of dividing her heart and person
between two lovers, and I with that of being one of these wretches. If
I knew that, for a single moment in your life, you ever had thought
this, either of her or myself, I should hate you until my last hour. But
it is with having said, and not with having thought it, that I charge
you. In this case, I cannot comprehend which of the three you
wished to injure; but, if you love peace of mind, tremble lest you
should have succeeded. I have not concealed either from you or her
all the ill I think of certain connections, but I wish these to end by a
means as virtuous as their cause, and that an illegitimate love may
be changed into an eternal friendship. Should I, who never do ill to
any person, be the innocent means of doing it to my friends? No, I
should never forgive you; I should become your irreconcilable
enemy. Your secrets are all I should respect; for I will never be a man
without honor.
"I do not apprehend my present perplexity will continue a long
time. I shall soon know whether or not I am deceived; I shall then
perhaps have great injuries to repair, which I will do with as much
cheerfulness as that with which the most agreeable act of my life has
been accompanied. But do you know in what manner I will make
amends for my faults during the short space of time I have to remain
near to you? By doing what nobody but myself would do; by telling
you freely what the world thinks of you, and the breaches you have
to repair in your reputation. Notwithstanding all the pretended friends

by whom you are surrounded, the moment you see me depart you
may bid adieu to truth, you will no longer find any person who will tell
it to you."
THIRD LETTER FROM THE SAME.
"I did not understand your letter of this morning; this I told you
because it was the case. I understand that of this evening; do not
imagine I shall ever return an answer to it; I am too anxious to forget
what it contains; and although you excite my pity, I am not proof
against the bitterness with which it has filled my mind. I! descend to
trick and cunning with you! I! accused of the blackest of all infamies!
Adieu, I regret your having the adieu. I know not what I say adieu: I
shall be very anxious to forgive you. You will come when you please;
you will be better received than your suspicions deserve. All I have
to desire of you is not to trouble yourself about my reputation. The
opinion of the world concerning me is of but little importance in my
esteem. My conduct is good, and this is sufficient for me. Besides, I
am ignorant of what has happened to the two persons who are dear
to me as they are to you."
This last letter extricated me from a terrible embarrassment, and
threw me into another of almost the same magnitude. Although
these letters and answers were sent and returned the same day with
an extreme rapidity, the interval had been sufficient to place another
between my rage and transport, and to give me time to reflect on the
enormity of my imprudence. Madam d'Houdetot had not
recommended to me anything so much as to remain quiet, to leave
her the care of extricating herself, and to avoid, especially at that
moment, all noise and rupture; and I, by the most open and atrocious
insults, took the properest means of carrying rage to its greatest
height in the heart of a woman who was already but too well
disposed to it. I now could naturally expect nothing from her but an
answer so haughty, disdainful, and expressive of contempt, that I
could not, without the utmost meanness, do otherwise than
immediately quit her house. Happily she, more adroit than I was
furious, avoided, by the manner of her answer, reducing me to that
extremity. But it was necessary either to quit or immediately go and

see her; the alternative was inevitable; I resolved on the latter,
though I foresaw how much I must be embarrassed in the
explanation. For how was I to get through it without exposing either
Madam d'Houdetot or Theresa? and woe to her whom I should have
named! There was nothing that the vengeance of an implacable and
an intriguing woman did not make me fear for the person who should
be the object of it. It was to prevent this misfortune that in my letter I
had spoken of nothing but suspicions, that I might not be under the
necessity of producing my proofs. This, it is true, rendered my
transports less excusable; no simple suspicions being sufficient to
authorize me to treat a woman, and especially a friend, in the
manner I had treated Madam d'Epinay. But here begins the noble
task I worthily fulfilled of expiating my faults and secret weaknesses
by charging myself with such of the former as I was incapable of
committing, and which I never did commit.
I had not to bear the attack I had expected, and fear was the
greatest evil I received from it. At my approach, Madam d' Epinay
threw her arms about my neck, bursting into tears. This unexpected
reception, and by an old friend, extremely affected me; I also shed
many tears. I said to her a few words which had not much meaning;
she uttered others with still less, and everything ended here. Supper
was served; we sat down to table, where, in expectation of the
explanation I imagined to be deferred until supper was over, I made
a very poor figure; for I am so overpowered by the most trifling
inquietude of mind that I cannot conceal it from persons the least
clear-sighted. My embarrassed appearance must have given her
courage, yet she did not risk anything upon that foundation. There
was no more explanation after than before supper: none took place
on the next day, and our little tete-a-tete conversations consisted of
indifferent things, or some complimentary words on my part, by
which, while I informed her I could not say more relative to my
suspicions, I asserted, with the greatest truth, that, if they were illfounded, my whole life should be employed in repairing the injustice.
She did not show the least curiosity to know precisely what they
were, nor for what reason I had formed them, and all our
peacemaking consisted, on her part as well as on mine, in the
embrace at our first meeting. Since Madam d'Epinay was the only

person offended, at least in form, I thought it was not for me to strive
to bring about an eclaircissement for which she herself did not seem
anxious, and I returned as I had come; continuing, besides, to live
with her upon the same footing as before, I soon almost entirely
forgot the quarrel, and foolishly believed she had done the same,
because she seemed not to remember what had passed.
This, it will soon appear, was not the only vexation caused me by
weakness; but I had others not less disagreeable which I had not
brought upon myself. The only cause of these was a desire of forcing
me from my solitude, by means of tormenting me. These originated
from Diderot and the d'Holbachiens.
[That is to take from it the old woman who was wanted in
the
conspiracy. It is astonishing that, during this long quarrel,
my stupid confidence presented me from comprehending
that it was
not me but her whom they wanted in Paris.]
Since I had resided at the Hermitage, Diderot incessantly
harrassed me, either himself or by means of De Leyre, and I soon
perceived from the pleasantries of the latter upon my ramblings in
the groves, with what pleasure he had travestied the hermit into the
gallant shepherd. But this was not the question in my quarrels with
Diderot; the cause of these were more serious. After the publication
of Fils Naturel he had sent me a copy of it, which I had read with the
interest and attention I ever bestowed on the works of a friend. In
reading the kind of poem annexed to it, I was surprised and rather
grieved to find in it, amongst several things, disobliging but
supportable against men in solitude, this bitter and severe sentence
without the least softening: 'Il n'y a que le mechant qui fail feul.'--[The
wicked only is alone.] --This sentence is equivocal, and seems to
present a double meaning; the one true, the other false, since it is
impossible that a man who is determined to remain alone can do the
least harm to anybody, and consequently he cannot be wicked. The
sentence in itself therefore required an interpretation; the more so
from an author who, when he sent it to the press, had a friend retired

from the world. It appeared to me shocking and uncivil, either to
have forgotten that solitary friend, or, in remembering him, not to
have made from the general maxim the honorable and just exception
which he owed, not only to his friend, but to so many respectable
sages, who, in all ages, have sought for peace and tranquillity in
retirement, and of whom, for the first time since the creation of the
world, a writer took it into his head indiscriminately to make so many
villains.
I had a great affection and the most sincere esteem for Diderot,
and fully depended upon his having the same sentiments for me. But
tired with his indefatigable obstinacy in continually opposing my
inclinations, taste, and manner of living, and everything which related
to no person but myself; shocked at seeing a man younger than I
was wish, at all events, to govern me like a child; disgusted with his
facility in promising, and his negligence in performing; weary of so
many appointments given by himself, and capriciously broken, while
new ones were again given only to be again broken; displeased at
uselessly waiting for him three or four times a month on the days he
had assigned, and in dining alone at night after having gone to Saint
Denis to meet him, and waited the whole day for his coming; my
heart was already full of these multiplied injuries. This last appeared
to me still more serious, and gave me infinite pain. I wrote to
complain of it, but in so mild and tender a manner that I moistened
my paper with my tears, and my letter was sufficiently affecting to
have drawn others from himself. It would be impossible to guess his
answer on this subject: it was literally as follows: "I am glad my work
has pleased and affected you. You are not of my opinion relative to
hermits. Say as much good of them as you please, you will be the
only one in the world of whom I shall think well: even on this there
would be much to say were it possible to speak to you without giving
you offence. A woman eighty years of age! etc. A phrase of a letter
from the son of Madam d'Epinay which, if I know you well, must have
given you much pain, has been mentioned to me."
The last two expressions of this letter want explanation.
Soon after I went to reside at the Hermitage, Madam le Vasseur
seemed dissatisfied with her situation, and to think the habitation too
retired. Having heard she had expressed her dislike to the place, I

offered to send her back to Paris, if that were more agreeable to her;
to pay her lodging, and to have the same care taken of her as if she
remained with me. She rejected my offer, assured me she was very
well satisfied with the Hermitage, and that the country air was of
service to her. This was evident, for, if I may so speak, she seemed
to become young again, and enjoyed better health than at Paris. Her
daughter told me her mother would, on the whole, had been very
sorry to quit the Hermitage, which was really a very delightful abode,
being fond of the little amusements of the garden and the care of the
fruit of which she had the handling, but that she had said, what she
had been desired to say, to induce me to return to Paris.
Failing in this attempt they endeavored to obtain by a scruple the
effect which complaisance had not produced, and construed into a
crime my keeping the old woman at a distance from the succors of
which, at her age, she might be in need. They did not recollect that
she, and many other old people, whose lives were prolonged by the
air of the country, might obtain these succors at Montmorency, near
to which I lived; as if there were no old people, except in Paris, and
that it was impossible for them to live in any other place. Madam le
Vasseur who eat a great deal, and with extreme voracity, was subject
to overflowings of bile and to strong diarrhoeas, which lasted several
days, and served her instead of clysters. At Paris she neither did nor
took anything for them, but left nature to itself. She observed the
same rule at the Hermitage, knowing it was the best thing she could
do. No matter, since there were not in the country either physicians
or apothecaries, keeping her there must, no doubt, be with the desire
of putting an end to her existence, although she was in perfect
health. Diderot should have determined at what age, under pain of
being punished for homicide, it is no longer permitted to let old
people remain out of Paris.
This was one of the atrocious accusations from which he did not
except me in his remark; that none but the wicked were alone: and
the meaning of his pathetic exclamation with the et cetera, which he
had benignantly added: A woman of eighty years of age, etc.
I thought the best answer that could be given to this reproach
would be from Madam le Vasseur herself. I desired her to write freely
and naturally her sentiments to Madam d'Epinay. To relieve her from

all constraint I would not see her letter. I showed her that which I am
going to transcribe. I wrote it to Madam d'Epinay upon the subject of
an answer I wish to return to a letter still more severe from Diderot,
and which she had prevented me from sending.
Thursday.
"My good friend. Madam le Vasseur is to write to you: I have
desired her to tell you sincerely what she thinks. To remove from her
all constraint, I have intimated to her that I will not see what she
writes, and I beg of you not to communicate to me any part of the
contents of her letter.
"I will not send my letter because you do not choose I should; but,
feeling myself grievously offended, it would be baseness and
falsehood, of either of which it is impossible for me to be guilty, to
acknowledge myself in the wrong. Holy writ commands him to whom
a blow is given, to turn the other cheek, but not to ask pardon. Do
you remember the man in comedy who exclaims, while he is giving
another blows with his staff, 'This is the part of a philosopher!'
"Do not flatter yourself that he will be prevented from coming by
the bad weather we now have. His rage will give him the time and
strength which friendship refuses him, and it will be the first time in
his life he ever came upon the day he had appointed.
"He will neglect nothing to come and repeat to me verbally the
injuries with which he loads me in his letters; I will endure them all
with patience--he will return to Paris to be ill again; and, according to
custom, I shall be a very hateful man. What is to be done? Endure it
all.
"But do not you admire the wisdom of the man who would
absolutely come to Saint Denis in a hackney-coach to dine there,
bring me home in a hackney-coach, and whose finances, eight days
afterwards, obliges him to come to the Hermitage on foot? It is not
possible, to speak his own language, that this should be the style of
sincerity. But were this the case, strange changes of fortune must
have happened in the course of a week.
"I join in your affliction for the illness of madam, your mother, but
you will perceive your grief is not equal to mine. We suffer less by

seeing the persons we love ill than when they are unjust and cruel.
"Adieu, my good friend, I shall never again mention to you this
unhappy affair. You speak of going to Paris with an unconcern,
which, at any other time, would give me pleasure."
I wrote to Diderot, telling him what I had done, relative to Madam
le Vasseur, upon the proposal of Madam d'Epinay herself; and
Madam le Vasseur having, as it may be imagined, chosen to remain
at the Hermitage, where she enjoyed a good state of health, always
had company, and lived very agreeably, Diderot, not knowing what
else to attribute to me as a crime, construed my precaution into one,
and discovered another in Madam le Vasseur continuing to reside at
the Hermitage, although this was by her own choice; and though her
going to Paris had depended, and still depended upon herself, where
she would continue to receive the same succors from me as I gave
her in my house.
This is the explanation of the first reproach in the letter of Diderot.
That of the second is in the letter which follows: "The learned man (a
name given in a joke by Grimm to the son of Madam d'Epinay) must
have informed you there were upon the rampart twenty poor persons
who were dying with cold and hunger, and waiting for the farthing
you customarily gave them. This is a specimen of our little
babbling.....And if you understand the rest it will amuse you perhap."
My answer to this terrible argument, of which Diderot seemed so
proud, was in the following words:
"I think I answered the learned man; that is, the farmer-general,
that I did not pity the poor whom he had seen upon the rampart,
waiting for my farthing; that he had probably amply made it up to
them; that I appointed him my substitute, that the poor of Paris would
have no reason to complain of the change; and that I should not
easily find so good a one for the poor of Montmorency, who were in
much greater need of assistance. Here is a good and respectable
old man, who, after having worked hard all his lifetime, no longer
being able to continue his labors, is in his old days dying with
hunger. My conscience is more satisfied with the two sous I give him
every Monday, than with the hundred farthings I should have
distributed amongst all the beggars on the rampart. You are pleasant
men, you philosophers, while you consider the inhabitants of the

cities as the only persons whom you ought to befriend. It is in the
country men learn how to love and serve humanity; all they learn in
cities is to despise it."
Such were the singular scruples on which a man of sense had the
folly to attribute to me as a crime my retiring from Paris, and
pretended to prove to me by my own example, that it was not
possible to live out of the capital without becoming a bad man. I
cannot at present conceive how I could be guilty of the folly of
answering him, and of suffering myself to be angry instead of
laughing in his fare. However, the decisions of Madam d'Epinay and
the clamors of the 'Cote in Holbachique' had so far operated in her
favor, that I was generally thought to be in the wrong; and the
D'Houdetot herself, very partial to Diderot, insisted upon my going to
see him at Paris, and making all the advances towards an
accommodation which, full and sincere as it was on my part, was not
of long duration. The victorious argument by which she subdued my
heart was, that at that moment Diderot was in distress. Besides the
storm excited against the 'Encyclopedie', he had then another violent
one to make head against, relative to his piece, which,
notwithstanding the short history he had printed at the head of it, he
was accused of having entirely taken from Goldoni. Diderot, more
wounded by criticisms than Voltaire, was overwhelmed by them.
Madam de Grasigny had been malicious enough to spread a report
that I had broken with him on this account. I thought it would be just
and generous publicly to prove the contrary, and I went to pass two
days, not only with him, but at his lodgings. This, since I had taken
up my abode at the Hermitage, was my second journey to Paris. I
had made the first to run to poor Gauffecourt, who had had a stroke
of apoplexy, from which he has never perfectly recovered: I did not
quit the side of his pillow until he was so far restored as to have no
further need of my assistance.
Diderot received me well. How many wrongs are effaced by the
embraces of a friend! after these, what resentment can remain in the
heart? We came to but little explanation. This is needless for
reciprocal invectives. The only thing necessary is to know how to
forget them. There had been no underhand proceedings, none at
least that had come to my knowledge: the case was not the same

with Madam d' Epinay. He showed me the plan of the 'Pere de
Famille'. "This," said I to him, "is the best defence to the 'Fils
Naturel'. Be silent, give your attention to this piece, and then throw it
at the head of your enemies as the only answer you think proper to
make them." He did so, and was satisfied with what he had done.
I had six months before sent him the first two parts of my 'Eloisa'
to have his opinion upon them. He had not yet read the work over.
We read a part of it together. He found this 'feuillet', that was his
term, by which he meant loaded with words and redundancies. I
myself had already perceived it; but it was the babbling of the fever: I
have never been able to correct it. The last parts are not the same.
The fourth especially, and the sixth, are master-pieces of diction.
The day after my arrival, he would absolutely take me to sup with
M. d'Holbach. We were far from agreeing on this point; for I wished
even to get rid of the bargain for the manuscript on chemistry, for
which I was enraged to be obliged to that man. Diderot carried all
before him. He swore D'Holbach loved me with all his heart, said I
must forgive him his manner, which was the same to everybody, and
more disagreeable to his friends than to others. He observed to me
that, refusing the produce of this manuscript, after having accepted it
two years before, was an affront to the donor which he had not
deserved, and that my refusal might be interpreted into a secret
reproach, for having waited so long to conclude the bargain. "I see,"
added he, "D'Holbach every day, and know better than you do the
nature of his disposition. Had you reason to be dissatisfied with him,
do you think your friend capable of advising you to do a mean
thing?" In short, with my accustomed weakness, I suffered myself to
be prevailed upon, and we went to sup with the baron, who received
me as he usually had done. But his wife received me coldly and
almost uncivilly. I saw nothing in her which resembled the amiable
Caroline, who, when a maid, expressed for me so many good
wishes. I thought I had already perceived that since Grimm had
frequented the house of D'Aine, I had not met there so friendly a
reception.
Whilst I was at Paris, Saint Lambert arrived there from the army.
As I was not acquainted with his arrival, I did not see him until after
my return to the country, first at the Chevrette, and afterwards at the

Hermitage; to which he came with Madam d'Houdetot, and invited
himself to dinner with me. It may be judged whether or not I received
him with pleasure! But I felt one still greater at seeing the good
understanding between my guests. Satisfied with not having
disturbed their happiness, I myself was happy in being a witness to
it, and I can safely assert that, during the whole of my mad passion,
and especially at the moment of which I speak, had it been in my
power to take from him Madam d'Houdetot I would not have done it,
nor should I have so much as been tempted to undertake it. I found
her so amiable in her passion for Saint Lambert, that I could scarcely
imagine she would have been as much so had she loved me instead
of him; and without wishing to disturb their union, all I really desired
of her was to permit herself to be loved. Finally, however violent my
passion may have been for this lady, I found it as agreeable to be the
confidant, as the object of her amours, and I never for a moment
considered her lover as a rival, but always as my friend. It will be
said this was not love: be it so, but it was something more.
As for Saint Lambert, he behaved like an honest and judicious
man: as I was the only person culpable, so was I the only one who
was punished; this, however, was with the greatest indulgence. He
treated me severely, but in a friendly manner, and I perceived I had
lost something in his esteem, but not the least part of his friendship.
For this I consoled myself, knowing it would be much more easy to
me to recover the one than the other, and that he had too much
sense to confound an involuntary weakness and a passion with a
vice of character. If even I were in fault in all that had passed, I was
but very little so. Had I first sought after his mistress? Had not he
himself sent her to me? Did not she come in search of me? Could I
avoid receiving her? What could I do? They themselves had done
the evil, and I was the person on whom it fell. In my situation they
would have done as much as I did, and perhaps more; for, however
estimable and faithful Madam d'Houdetot might be, she was still a
woman; her lover was absent; opportunities were frequent;
temptations strong; and it would have been very difficult for her
always to have defended herself with the same success against a
more enterprising man. We certainly had done a great deal in our

situation, in placing boundaries beyond which we never permitted
ourselves to pass.
Although at the bottom of my heart I found evidence sufficiently
honorable in my favor, so many appearances were against me, that
the invincible shame always predominant in me, gave me in his
presence the appearance of guilt, and of this he took advantage for
the purpose of humbling me: a single circumstance will describe this
reciprocal situation. I read to him, after dinner, the letter I had written
the preceding year to Voltaire, and of which Saint Lambert had heard
speak. Whilst I was reading he fell asleep, and I, lately so haughty, at
present so foolish, dared not stop, and continued to read whilst he
continued to snore. Such were my indignities and such his revenge;
but his generosity never permitted him to exercise them; except
between ourselves.
After his return to the army, I found Madam d'Houdetot greatly
changed in her manner with me. At this I was as much surprised as if
it had not been what I ought to have expected; it affected me more
than it ought to have done, and did me considerable harm. It seemed
that everything from which I expected a cure, still plunged deeper
into my heart the dart, which I at length broke in rather than draw
out.
I was quite determined to conquer myself, and leave no means
untried to change my foolish passion into a pure and lasting
friendship. For this purpose I had formed the finest projects in the
world; for the execution of which the concurrence of Madam d'
Houdetot was necessary. When I wished to speak to her I found her
absent and embarrassed; I perceived I was no longer agreeable to
her, and that something had passed which she would not
communicate to me, and which I have never yet known. This
change, and the impossibility of knowing the reason of it, grieved me
to the heart.
She asked me for her letters; these I returned her with a fidelity of
which she did me the insult to doubt for a moment.
This doubt was another wound given to my heart, with which she
must have been so well acquainted. She did me justice, but not
immediately: I understood that an examination of the packet I had
sent her, made her perceive her error; I saw she reproached herself

with it, by which I was a gainer of something. She could not take
back her letters without returning me mine. She told me she had
burnt them: of this I dared to doubt in my turn, and I confess I doubt
of it at this moment. No, such letters as mine to her were, are never
thrown into the fire. Those of Eloisa have been found ardent.
Heavens! what would have been said of these! No, No, she who
can inspire a like passion, will never have the courage to burn the
proofs of it. But I am not afraid of her having made a bad use of
them: of this I do not think her capable; and besides I had taken
proper measures to prevent it. The foolish, but strong apprehension
of raillery, had made me begin this correspondence in a manner to
secure my letters from all communication. I carried the familiarity I
permitted myself with her in my intoxication so far as to speak to her
in the singular number: but what theeing and thouing! she certainly
could not be offended with it. Yet she several times complained, but
this was always useless: her complaints had no other effect than that
of awakening my fears, and I besides could not suffer myself to lose
ground. If these letters be not yet destroyed, and should they ever be
made public, the world will see in what manner I have loved.
The grief caused me by the coldness of Madam d'Houdetot, and
the certainty of not having merited it, made me take the singular
resolution to complain of it to Saint Lambert himself. While waiting
the effect of the letter I wrote to him, I sought dissipations to which I
ought sooner to have had recourse. Fetes were given at the
Chevrette for which I composed music. The pleasure of honoring
myself in the eyes of Madam d'Houdetot by a talent she loved,
warmed my imagination, and another object still contributed to give it
animation, this was the desire the author of the 'Devin du Villaqe'
had of showing he understood music; for I had perceived some
persons had, for a considerable time past, endeavored to render this
doubtful, at least with respect to composition. My beginning at Paris,
the ordeal through which I had several times passed there, both at
the house of M. Dupin and that of M. de la Popliniere; the quantity of
music I had composed during fourteen years in the midst of the most
celebrated masters and before their eyes:--finally, the opera of the
'Muses Gallantes', and that even of the 'Devin'; a motet I had
composed for Mademoiselle Fel, and which she had sung at the

spiritual concert; the frequent conferences I had had upon this fine
art with the first composers, all seemed to prevent or dissipate a
doubt of such a nature. This however existed even at the Chevrette,
and in the mind of M. d'Epinay himself. Without appearing to observe
it, I undertook to compose him a motet for the dedication of the
chapel of the Chevrette, and I begged him to make choice of the
words. He directed de Linant, the tutor to his son, to furnish me with
these. De Linant gave me words proper to the subject, and in a week
after I had received them the motet was finished. This time, spite
was my Apollo, and never did better music come from my hand. The
words began with: 'Ecce sedes hic tonantis'. (I have since learned
these were by Santeuil, and that M. de Linant had without scruple
appropriated them to himself.) The grandeur of the opening is
suitable to the words, and the rest of the motet is so elegantly
harmonious that everyone was struck with it. I had composed it for a
great orchestra. D'Epinay procured the best performers. Madam
Bruna, an Italian singer, sung the motet, and was well accompanied.
The composition succeeded so well that it was afterwards performed
at the spiritual concert, where, in spite of secret cabals, and
notwithstanding it was badly executed, it was twice generally
applauded. I gave for the birthday of M. d'Epinay the idea of a kind of
piece half dramatic and half pantomimical, of which I also composed
the music. Grimm, on his arrival, heard speak of my musical
success. An hour afterwards not a word more was said on the
subject; but there no longer remained a doubt, not at least that I
know of, of my knowledge of composition.
Grimm was scarcely arrived at the Chevrette, where I already did
not much amuse myself, before he made it insupportable to me by
airs I never before saw in any person, and of which I had no idea.
The evening before he came, I was dislodged from the chamber of
favor, contiguous to that of Madam d'Epinay; it was prepared for
Grimm, and instead of it, I was put into another further off. "In this
manner," said I, laughingly, to Madam d'Epinay, "new-comers
displace those which are established." She seemed embarrassed. I
was better acquainted the same evening with the reason for the
change, in learning that between her chamber and that I had quitted
there was a private door which she had thought needless to show

me. Her intercourse with Grimm was not a secret either in her own
house or to the public, not even to her husband; yet, far from
confessing it to me, the confidant of secrets more important to her,
and which was sure would be faithfully kept, she constantly denied it
in the strongest manner. I comprehended this reserve proceeded
from Grimm, who, though intrusted with all my secrets, did not
choose I should be with any of his.
However prejudiced I was in favor of this man by former
sentiments, which were not extinguished, and by the real merit he
had, all was not proof against the cares he took to destroy it. He
received me like the Comte de Tuffiere; he scarcely deigned to
return my salute; he never once spoke to me, and prevented my
speaking to him by not making me any answer; he everywhere
passed first, and took the first place without ever paying me the least
attention. All this would have been supportable had he not
accompanied it with a shocking affectation, which may be judged of
by one example taken from a hundred. One evening Madam
d'Epinay, finding herself a little indisposed, ordered something for her
supper to be carried into her chamber, and went up stairs to sup by
the side of the fire. She asked me to go with her, which I did. Grimm
came afterwards. The little table was already placed, and there were
but two covers. Supper was served; Madam d' Epinay took her place
on one side of the fire, Grimm took an armed chair, seated himself at
the other, drew the little table between them, opened his napkin, and
prepared himself for eating without speaking to me a single word.
Madam d' Epinay blushed at his behavior, and, to induce him to
repair his rudeness, offered me her place. He said nothing, nor did
he ever look at me. Not being able to approach the fire, I walked
about the chamber until a cover was brought. Indisposed as I was,
older than himself, longer acquainted in the house than he had been,
the person who had introduced him there, and to whom as a favorite
of the lady he ought to have done the honors of it, he suffered me to
sup at the end of the table, at a distance from the fire, without
showing me the least civility. His whole behavior to me corresponded
with this example of it. He did not treat me precisely as his inferior,
but he looked upon me as a cipher. I could scarcely recognize the
same Grimm, who, to the house of the Prince de Saxe-Gotha,

thought himself honored when I cast my eyes upon him. I had still
more difficulty in reconciling this profound silence and insulting
haughtiness with the tender friendship he possessed for me to those
whom he knew to be real friends. It is true the only proofs he gave of
it was pitying my wretched fortune, of which I did not complain;
compassionating my sad fate, with which I was satisfied; and
lamenting to see me obstinately refuse the benevolent services he
said, he wished to render me. Thus was it he artfully made the world
admire his affectionate generosity, blame my ungrateful misanthropy,
and insensibly accustomed people to imagine there was nothing
more between a protector like him and a wretch like myself, than a
connection founded upon benefactions on one part and obligations
on the other, without once thinking of a friendship between equals.
For my part, I have vainly sought to discover in what I was under an
obligation to this new protector. I had lent him money, he had never
lent me any; I had attended him in his illness, he scarcely came to
see me in mine; I had given him all my friends, he never had given
me any of his; I had said everything I could in his favor, and if ever
he has spoken of me it has been less publicly and in another
manner. He has never either rendered or offered me the least
service of any kind. How, therefore, was he my Mecaenas? In what
manner was I protected by him? This was incomprehensible to me,
and still remains so.
It is true, he was more or less arrogant with everybody, but I was
the only person with whom he was brutally so. I remember Saint
Lambert once ready to throw a plate at his head, upon his, in some
measure, giving him the lie at table by vulgarly saying, "That is not
true." With his naturally imperious manner he had the self-sufficiency
of an upstart, and became ridiculous by being extravagantly
impertinent. An intercourse with the great had so far intoxicated him
that he gave himself airs which none but the contemptible part of
them ever assume. He never called his lackey but by "Eh!" as if
amongst the number of his servants my lord had not known which
was in waiting. When he sent him to buy anything, he threw the
money upon the ground instead of putting it into his hand. In short,
entirely forgetting he was a man, he treated him with such shocking
contempt, and so cruel a disdain in everything, that the poor lad, a

very good creature, whom Madam d'Epinay had recommended,
quitted his service without any other complaint than that of the
impossibility of enduring such treatment. This was the la Fleur of this
new presuming upstart.
As these things were nothing more than ridiculous, but quite
opposite to my character, they contributed to render him suspicious
to me. I could easily imagine that a man whose head was so much
deranged could not have a heart well placed. He piqued himself
upon nothing so much as upon sentiments. How could this agree
with defects which are peculiar to little minds? How can the
continued overflowings of a susceptible heart suffer it to be
incessantly employed in so many little cares relative to the person?
He who feels his heart inflamed with this celestial fire strives to
diffuse it, and wishes to show what he internally is. He would wish to
place his heart in his countenance, and thinks not of other paint for
his cheeks.
I remember the summary of his morality which Madam d'Epinay
had mentioned to me and adopted. This consisted in one single
article; that the sole duty of man is to follow all the inclinations of his
heart. This morality, when I heard it mentioned, gave me great
matter of reflection, although I at first considered it solely as a play of
wit. But I soon perceived it was a principle really the rule of his
conduct, and of which I afterwards had, at my own expense, but too
many convincing proofs. It is the interior doctrine Diderot has so
frequently intimated to me, but which I never heard him explain.
I remember having several years before been frequently told that
Grimm was false, that he had nothing more than the appearance of
sentiment, and particularly that he did not love me. I recollected
several little anecdotes which I had heard of him by M. de Francueil
and Madam de Chenonceaux, neither of whom esteemed him, and
to whom he must have been known, as Madam de Chenonceaux
was daughter to Madam de Rochechouart, the intimate friend of the
late Comte de Friese, and that M. de Francueil, at that time very
intimate with the Viscount de Polignac, had lived a good deal at the
Palais Royal precisely when Grimm began to introduce himself
there. All Paris heard of his despair after the death of the Comte de
Friese. It was necessary to support the reputation he had acquired

after the rigors of Mademoiselle Fel, and of which I, more than any
other person, should have seen the imposture, had I been less blind.
He was obliged to be dragged to the Hotel de Castries where he
worthily played his part, abandoned to the most mortal affliction.
There, he every morning went into the garden to weep at his ease,
holding before his eyes his handkerchief moistened with tears, as
long as he was in sight of the hotel, but at the turning of a certain
alley, people, of whom he little thought, saw him instantly put his
handkerchief in his pocket and take out of it a book. This
observation, which was repeatedly made, soon became public in
Paris, and was almost as soon forgotten. I myself had forgotten it; a
circumstance in which I was concerned brought it to my recollection.
I was at the point of death in my bed, in the Rue de Grenelle, Grimm
was in the country; he came one morning, quite out of breath, to see
me, saying, he had arrived in town that very instant; and a moment
afterwards I learned he had arrived the evening before, and had
been seen at the theatre.
I heard many things of the same kind; but an observation, which I
was surprised not to have made sooner, struck me more than
anything else. I had given to Grimm all my friends without exception,
they were become his. I was so inseparable from him, that I should
have had some difficulty in continuing to visit at a house where he
was not received. Madam de Crequi was the only person who
refused to admit him into her company, and whom for that reason I
have seldom since seen. Grimm on his part made himself other
friends, as well by his own means, as by those of the Comte de
Friese. Of all these not one of them ever became my friend: he never
said a word to induce me even to become acquainted with them, and
not one of those I sometimes met at his apartments ever showed me
the least good will; the Comte de Friese, in whose house he lived,
and with whom it consequently would have been agreeable to me to
form some connection, not excepted, nor the Comte de Schomberg,
his relation, with whom Grimm was still more intimate.
Add to this, my own friends, whom I made his, and who were all
tenderly attached to me before this acquaintance, were no longer so
the moment it was made. He never gave me one of his. I gave him

all mine, and these he has taken from me. If these be the effects of
friendship, what are those of enmity?
Diderot himself told me several times at the beginning that Grimm
in whom I had so much confidence, was not my friend. He changed
his language the moment he was no longer so himself.
The manner in which I had disposed of my children wanted not the
concurrence of any person. Yet I informed some of my friends of it,
solely to make it known to them, and that I might not in their eyes
appear better than I was. These friends were three in number:
Diderot, Grimm, and Madam d'Epinay. Duclos, the most worthy of
my confidence, was the only real friend whom I did not inform of it.
He nevertheless knew what I had done. By whom? This I know not.
It is not very probable the perfidy came from Madam d'Epinay, who
knew that by following her example, had I been capable of doing it, I
had in my power the means of a cruel revenge. It remains therefore
between Grimm and Diderot, then so much united, especially against
me, and it is probable this crime was common to them both. I would
lay a wager that Duclos, to whom I never told my secret, and who
consequently was at liberty to make what use he pleased of his
information, is the only person who has not spoken of it again.
Grimm and Diderot, in their project to take from me the
governesses, had used the greatest efforts to make Duclos enter
into their views; but this he refused to do with disdain. It was not until
sometime afterwards that I learned from him what had passed
between them on the subject; but I learned at the time from Theresa
enough to perceive there was some secret design, and that they
wished to dispose of me, if not against my own consent, at least
without my knowledge, or had an intention of making these two
persons serve as instruments of some project they had in view. This
was far from upright conduct. The opposition of Duclos is a
convincing proof of it. They who think proper may believe it to be
friendship.
This pretended friendship was as fatal to me at home as it was
abroad. The long and frequent conversations with Madam le
Vasseur, for, several years past, had made a sensible change in this
woman's behavior to me, and the change was far from being in my
favor. What was the subject of these singular conversations? Why

such a profound mystery? Was the conversation of that old woman
agreeable enough to take her into favor, and of sufficient importance
to make of it so great a secret? During the two or three years these
colloquies had, from time to time, been continued, they had
appeared to me ridiculous; but when I thought of them again, they
began to astonish me. This astonishment would have been carried to
inquietude had I then known what the old creature was preparing for
me.
Notwithstanding the pretended zeal for my welfare of which Grimm
made such a public boast, difficult to reconcile with the airs he gave
himself when we were together, I heard nothing of him from any
quarter the least to my advantage, and his feigned commiseration
tended less to do me service than to render me contemptible. He
deprived me as much as he possibly could of the resource I found in
the employment I had chosen, by decrying me as a bad copyist. I
confess he spoke the truth; but in this case it was not for him to do it.
He proved himself in earnest by employing another copyist, and
prevailing upon everybody he could, by whom I was engaged, to do
the same. His intention might have been supposed to be that of
reducing me to a dependence upon him and his credit for a
subsistence, and to cut off the latter until I was brought to that
degree of distress.
All things considered, my reason imposed silence upon my former
prejudice, which still pleaded in his favor. I judged his character to be
at least suspicious, and with respect to his friendship I positively
decided it to be false. I then resolved to see him no more, and
informed Madam d'Epinay of the resolution I had taken, supporting, it
with several unanswerable facts, but which I have now forgotten.
She strongly combated my resolution without knowing how to reply
to the reasons on which it was founded. She had not concerted with
him; but the next day, instead of explaining herself verbally, she, with
great address, gave me a letter they had drawn up together, and by
which, without entering into a detail of facts, she justified him by his
concentrated character, attributed to me as a crime my having
suspected him of perfidy towards his friend, and exhorted me to
come to an accommodation with him. This letter staggered me. In a
conversation we afterwards had together, and in which I found her

better prepared than she had been the first time, I suffered myself to
be quite prevailed upon, and was inclined to believe I might have
judged erroneously. In this case I thought I really had done a friend a
very serious injury, which it was my duty to repair. In short, as I had
already done several times with Diderot, and the Baron d'Holbach,
half from inclination, and half from weakness, I made all the
advances I had a right to require; I went to M. Grimm, like another
George Dandin, to make him my apologies for the offence he had
given me; still in the false persuasion, which, in the course of my life
has made me guilty of a thousand meannesses to my pretended
friends, that there is no hatred which may not be disarmed by
mildness and proper behavior; whereas, on the contrary, the hatred
of the wicked becomes still more envenomed by the impossibility of
finding anything to found it upon, and the sentiment of their own
injustice is another cause of offence against the person who is the
object of it. I have, without going further than my own history, a
strong proof of this maxim in Grimm, and in Tronchin; both became
my implacable enemies from inclination, pleasure and fancy, without
having been able to charge me with having done either of them the
most trifling injury, and whose rage, like that of tigers, becomes daily
more fierce by the facility of satiating it.
[I did not give the surname of Jongleur only to the latter until a
long time after his enmity had been declared, and the
persecutions
he brought upon me at Geneva and elsewhere. I soon
suppressed the
name the moment I perceived I was entirely his victim. Mean
vengeance is unworthy of my heart, and hatred never takes the
least
root in it.]
I expected that Grimm, confused by my condescension and
advances, would receive me with open arms, and the most tender
friendship. He received me as a Roman Emperor would have done,
and with a haughtiness I never saw in any person but himself. I was
by no means prepared for such a reception. When, in the

embarrassment of the part I had to act, and which was so unworthy
of me, I had, in a few words and with a timid air, fulfilled the object
which had brought me to him; before he received me into favor, he
pronounced, with a deal of majesty, an harangue he had prepared,
and which contained a long enumeration of his rare virtues, and
especially those connected with friendship. He laid great stress upon
a thing which at first struck me a great deal: this was his having
always preserved the same friends. Whilst he was yet speaking, I
said to myself, it would be cruel for me to be the only exception to
this rule. He returned to the subject so frequently, and with such
emphasis, that I thought, if in this he followed nothing but the
sentiments of his heart, he would be less struck with the maxim, and
that he made of it an art useful to his views by procuring the means
of accomplishing them. Until then I had been in the same situation; I
had preserved all my first friends, those even from my tenderest
infancy, without having lost one of them except by death, and yet I
had never before made the reflection: it was not a maxim I had
prescribed myself. Since, therefore, the advantage was common to
both, why did he boast of it in preference, if he had not previously
intended to deprive me of the merit? He afterwards endeavored to
humble me by proofs of the preference our common friends gave to
me. With this I was as well acquainted as himself; the question was,
by what means he had obtained it? whether it was by merit or
address? by exalting himself, or endeavoring to abase me? At last,
when he had placed between us all the distance that he could add to
the value of the favor he was about to confer, he granted me the kiss
of peace, in a slight embrace which resembled the accolade which
the king gives to newmade knights. I was stupefied with surprise: I
knew not what to say; not a word could I utter. The whole scene had
the appearance of the reprimand a preceptor gives to his pupil while
he graciously spares inflicting the rod. I never think of it without
perceiving to what degree judgments, founded upon appearances to
which the vulgar give so much weight, are deceitful, and how
frequently audaciousness and pride are found in the guilty, and
shame and embarrassment in the innocent.
We were reconciled: this was a relief to my heart, which every kind
of quarrel fills with anguish. It will naturally be supposed that a like

reconciliation changed nothing in his manners; all it effected was to
deprive me of the right of complaining of them. For this reason I took
a resolution to endure everything, and for the future to say not a
word.
So many successive vexations overwhelmed me to such a degree
as to leave me but little power over my mind. Receiving no answer
from Saint Lambert, neglected by Madam d'Houdetot, and no longer
daring to open my heart to any person, I began to be afraid that by
making friendship my idol, I should sacrifice my whole life to
chimeras. After putting all those with whom I had been acquainted to
the test, there remained but two who had preserved my esteem, and
in whom my heart could confide: Duclos, of whom since my retreat to
the Hermitage I had lost sight, and Saint Lambert. I thought the only
means of repairing the wrongs I had done the latter, was to open
myself to him without reserve, and I resolved to confess to him
everything by which his mistress should not be exposed. I have no
doubt but this was another snare of my passions to keep me nearer
to her person; but I should certainly have had no reserve with her
lover, entirely submitting to his direction, and carrying sincerity as far
as it was possible to do it. I was upon the point of writing to him a
second letter, to which I was certain he would have returned an
answer, when I learned the melancholy cause of his silence relative
to the first. He had been unable to support until the end the fatigues
of the campaign. Madam d'Epinay informed me he had had an
attack of the palsy, and Madam d'Houdetot, ill from affliction, wrote
me two or three days after from Paris, that he was going to Aix-laChapelle to take the benefit of the waters. I will not say this
melancholy circumstance afflicted me as it did her; but I am of
opinion my grief of heart was as painful as her tears. The pain of
knowing him to be in such a state, increased by the fear least
inquietude should have contributed to occasion it, affected me more
than anything that had yet happened, and I felt most cruelly a want
of fortitude, which in my estimation was necessary to enable me to
support so many misfortunes. Happily this generous friend did not
long leave me so overwhelmed with affliction; he did not forget me,
notwithstanding his attack; and I soon learned from himself that I had
ill judged his sentiments, and been too much alarmed for his

situation. It is now time I should come to the grand revolution of my
destiny, to the catastrophe which has divided my life in two parts so
different from each other, and, from a very trifling cause, produced
such terrible effects.
One day, little thinking of what was to happen, Madam d'Epinay
sent for me to the Chevrette. The moment I saw her I perceived in
her eyes and whole countenance an appearance of uneasiness,
which struck me the more, as this was not customary, nobody
knowing better than she did how to govern her features and her
movements. "My friend," said she to me, "I am immediately going to
set off for Geneva; my breast is in a bad state, and my health so
deranged that I must go and consult Tronchin." I was the more
astonished at this resolution so suddenly taken, and at the beginning
of the bad season of the year, as thirty-six hours before she had not,
when I left her, so much as thought of it. I asked her who she would
take with her. She said her son and M. de Linant; and afterwards
carelessly added, "And you, dear, will not you go also?" As I did not
think she spoke seriously, knowing that at the season of the year I
was scarcely in a situation to go to my chamber, I joked upon the
utility of the company, of one sick person to another. She herself had
not seemed to make the proposition seriously, and here the matter
dropped. The rest of our conversation ran upon the necessary
preparations for her journey, about which she immediately gave
orders, being determined to set off within a fortnight. She lost nothing
by my refusal, having prevailed upon her husband to accompany
her.
A few days afterwards I received from Diderot the note I am going
to transcribe. This note, simply doubled up, so that the contents were
easily read, was addressed to me at Madam d'Epinay's, and sent to
M. de Linant, tutor to the son, and confidant to the mother.
NOTE FROM DIDEROT.
"I am naturally disposed to love you, and am born to give you
trouble. I am informed Madam d'Epinay is going to Geneva, and do
not hear you are to accompany her. My friend, you are satisfied with
Madam d'Epinay, you must go, with her; if dissatisfied you ought still
less to hesitate. Do you find the weight of the obligations you are

under to her uneasy to you? This is an opportunity of discharging a
part of them, and relieving your mind. Do you ever expect another
opportunity like the present one, of giving her proofs of your
gratitude? She is going to a country where she will be quite a
stranger. She is ill, and will stand in need of amusement and
dissipation. The winter season too! Consider, my friend. Your ill state
of health may be a much greater objection than I think it is; but are
you now more indisposed than you were a month ago, or than you
will be at the beginning of spring? Will you three months hence be in
a situation to perform the journey more at your ease than at present?
For my part I cannot but observe to you that were I unable to bear
the shaking of the carriage I would take my staff and follow her. Have
you no fears lest your conduct should be misinterpreted? You will be
suspected of ingratitude or of a secret motive. I well know, that let
you do as you will you will have in your favor the testimony of your
conscience, but will this alone be sufficient, and is it permitted to
neglect to a certain degree that which is necessary to acquire the
approbation of others? What I now write, my good friend, is to acquit
myself of what I think I owe to us both. Should my letter displease
you, throw it into the fire and let it be forgotten. I salute, love and
embrace you."
Although trembling and almost blind with rage whilst I read this
epistle, I remarked the address with which Diderot affected a milder
and more polite language than he had done in his former ones,
wherein he never went further than "My dear," without ever deigning
to add the name of friend. I easily discovered the secondhand
means by which the letter was conveyed to me; the subscription,
manner and form awkwardly betrayed the manoeuvre; for we
commonly wrote to each other by post, or the messenger of
Montmorency, and this was the first and only time he sent me his
letter by any other conveyance.
As soon as the first transports of my indignation permitted me to
write, I, with great precipitation, wrote him the following answer,
which I immediately carried from the Hermitage, where I then was, to
Chevrette, to show it to Madam d' Epinay; to whom, in my blind rage,
I read the contents, as well as the letter from Diderot.

"You cannot, my dear friend, either know the magnitude of the
obligations I am under to Madam d'Epinay, to what a degree I am
bound by them, whether or not she is desirous of my accompanying
her, that this is possible, or the reasons I may have for my
noncompliance. I have no objection to discuss all these points with
you; but you will in the meantime confess that prescribing to me so
positively what I ought to do, without first enabling yourself to judge
of the matter, is, my dear philosopher, acting very inconsiderately.
What is still worse, I perceive the opinion you give comes not from
yourself. Besides my being but little disposed to suffer myself to be
led by the nose under your name by any third or fourth person, I
observe in this secondary advice certain underhand dealing, which ill
agrees with your candor, and from which you will on your account, as
well as mine, do well in future to abstain.
"You are afraid my conduct should be misinterpreted; but I defy a
heart like yours to think ill of mine. Others would perhaps speak
better of me if I resembled them more. God preserve me from
gaining their approbation! Let the vile and wicked watch over my
conduct and misinterpret my actions, Rousseau is not a man to be
afraid of them, nor is Diderot to be prevailed upon to hearken to what
they say.
"If I am displeased with your letter, you wish me to throw it into the
fire, and pay no attention to the contents. Do you imagine that
anything coming from you can be forgotten in such a manner? You
hold, my dear friend, my tears as cheap in the pain you give me, as
you do my life and health, in the cares you exhort me to take. Could
you but break yourself of this, your friendship would be more
pleasing to me, and I should be less to be pitied."
On entering the chamber of Madam d'Epinay I found Grimm with
her, with which I was highly delighted. I read to them, in a loud and
clear voice, the two letters, with an intrepidity of which I should not
have thought myself capable, and concluded with a few observations
not in the least derogatory to it. At this unexpected audacity in a man
generally timid, they were struck dumb with surprise; I perceived that
arrogant man look down upon the ground, not daring to meet my
eyes, which sparkled with indignation; but in the bottom of his heart
he from that instant resolved upon my destruction, and, with Madam

d' Epinay, I am certain concerted measures to that effect before they
separated.
It was much about this time that I at length received, by Madam
d'Houdetot, the answer from Saint Lambert, dated from Wolfenbuttle,
a few days after the accident had happened to him, to my letter
which had been long delayed upon the road. This answer gave me
the consolation of which I then stood so much in need; it was full of
assurance of esteem and friendship, and these gave me strength
and courage to deserve them. From that moment I did my duty, but
had Saint Lambert been less reasonable, generous and honest, I
was inevitably lost.
The season became bad, and people began to quit the country.
Madam d'Houdetot informed me of the day on which she intended to
come and bid adieu to the valley, and gave me a rendezvous at
Laubonne. This happened to be the same day on which Madam
d'Epinay left the Chevrette to go to Paris for the purpose of
completing preparations for her journey. Fortunately she set off in the
morning, and I had still time to go and dine with her sister-in-law. I
had the letter from Saint Lambert in my pocket, and read it over
several times as I walked along, This letter served me as a shield
against my weakness. I made and kept to the resolution of seeing
nothing in Madam d'Houdetot but my friend and the mistress of Saint
Lambert; and I passed with her a tete-a-fete of four hours in a most
delicious calm, infinitely preferable, even with respect to enjoyment,
to the paroxysms of a burning fever, which, always, until that
moment, I had had when in her presence. As she too well knew my
heart not to be changed, she was sensible of the efforts I made to
conquer myself, and esteemed me the more for them, and I had the
pleasure of perceiving that her friendship for me was not
extinguished. She announced to me the approaching return of Saint
Lambert, who, although well enough recovered from his attack, was
unable to bear the fatigues of war, and was quitting the service to
come and live in peace with her. We formed the charming project of
an intimate connection between us three, and had reason to hope it
would be lasting, since it was founded on every sentiment by which
honest and susceptible hearts could be united; and we had
moreover amongst us all the knowledge and talents necessary to be

sufficient to ourselves without the aid of any foreign supplement.
Alas! in abandoning myself to the hope of so agreeable a life I little
suspected that which awaited me.
We afterwards spoke of my situation with Madam d'Epinay. I
showed her the letter from Diderot, with my answer to it; I related to
her everything that had passed upon the subject, and declared to her
my resolution of quitting the Hermitage.
This she vehemently opposed, and by reasons all powerful over
my heart. She expressed to me how much she could have wished I
had been of the party to Geneva, foreseeing she should inevitably be
considered as having caused the refusal, which the letter of Diderot
seemed previously to announce. However, as she was acquainted
with my reasons, she did not insist upon this point, but conjured me
to avoid coming to an open rupture let it cost me what mortification it
would, and to palliate my refusal by reasons sufficiently plausible to
put away all unjust suspicions of her having been the cause of it. I
told her the task she imposed on me was not easy; but that, resolved
to expiate my faults at the expense of my reputation, I would give the
preference to hers in everything that honor permitted me to suffer. It
will soon be seen whether or not I fulfilled this engagement.
My passion was so far from having lost any part of its force that I
never in my life loved my Sophia so ardently and tenderly as on that
day, but such was the impression made upon me by the letter of
Saint Lambert, the sentiment of my duty and the horror in which I
held perfidy, that during the whole time of the interview my senses
left me in peace, and I was not so much as tempted to kiss her hand.
At parting she embraced me before her servants. This embrace, so
different from those I had sometimes stolen from her under the
foliage, proved I was become master of myself; and I am certain that
had my mind, undisturbed, had time to acquire more firmness, three
months would have cured me radically.
Here ends my personal connections with Madam d'Houdetot;
connections of which each has been able to judge by appearance
according to the disposition of his own heart, but in which the
passion inspired me by that amiable woman, the most lively passion,
perhaps, man ever felt, will be honorable in our own eyes by the rare
and painful sacrifice we both made to duty, honor, love, and

friendship. We each had too high an opinion of the other easily to
suffer ourselves to do anything derogatory to our dignity. We must
have been unworthy of all esteem had we not set a proper value
upon one like this, and the energy of my sentiments which have
rendered us culpable, was that which prevented us from becoming
so.
Thus after a long friendship for one of these women, and the
strongest affection for the other, I bade them both adieu the same
day, to one never to see her more, to the other to see her again
twice, upon occasions of which I shall hereafter speak.
After their departure, I found myself much embarrassed to fulfill so
many pressing and contradictory duties, the consequences of my
imprudence; had I been in my natural situation, after the proposition
and refusal of the journey to Geneva, I had only to remain quiet, and
everything was as it should be. But I had foolishly made of it an affair
which could not remain in the state it was, and an explanation was
absolutely necessary, unless I quitted the Hermitage, which I had
just promised Madam d'Houdetot not to do, at least for the present.
Moreover she had required me to make known the reasons for my
refusal to my pretended friends, that it might not be imputed to her.
Yet I could not state the true reason without doing an outrage to
Madam d'Epinay, who certainly had a right to my gratitude for what
she had done for me. Everything well considered, I found myself
reduced to the severe but indispensable necessity of failing in
respect, either to Madam d'Upinay, Madam d'Houdetot or to myself;
and it was the last I resolved to make my victim. This I did without
hesitation, openly and fully, and with so much generosity as to make
the act worthy of expiating the faults which had reduced me to such
an extremity. This sacrifice, taken advantage of by my enemies, and
which they, perhaps, did not expect, has ruined my reputation, and
by their assiduity, deprived me of the esteem of the public; but it has
restored to me my own, and given me consolation in my misfortune.
This, as it will hereafter appear, is not the last time I made such a
sacrifice, nor that advantages were taken of it to do me an injury.
Grimm was the only person who appeared to have taken no part in
the affair, and it was to him I determined to address myself. I wrote
him a long letter, in which I set forth the ridiculousness of considering

it as my duty to accompany Madam d' Epinay to Geneva, the inutility
of the measure, and the embarrassment even it would have caused
her, besides the inconvenience to myself. I could not resist the
temptation of letting him perceive in this letter how fully I was
informed in what manner things were arranged, and that to me it
appeared singular I should be expected to undertake the journey
whilst he himself dispensed with it, and that his name was never
mentioned. This letter, wherein, on account of my not being able
clearly to state my reasons, I was often obliged to wander from the
text, would have rendered me culpable in the eyes of the public, but
it was a model of reservedness and discretion for the people who,
like Grimm, were fully acquainted with the things I forbore to
mention, and which justified my conduct. I did not even hesitate to
raise another prejudice against myself in attributing the advice of
Diderot, to my other friends. This I did to insinuate that Madam
d'Houdetot had been in the same opinion as she really was, and in
not mentioning that, upon the reasons I gave her, she thought
differently, I could not better remove the suspicion of her having
connived at my proceedings than appearing dissatisfied with her
behavior.
This letter was concluded by an act of confidence which would
have had an effect upon any other man; for, in desiring Grimm to
weigh my reasons and afterwards to give me his opinion, I informed
him that, let this be what it would, I should act accordingly, and such
was my intention had he even thought I ought to set off; for M.
d'Epinay having appointed himself the conductor of his wife, my
going with them would then have had a different appearance;
whereas it was I who, in the first place, was asked to take upon me
that employment, and he was out of the question until after my
refusal.
The answer from Grimm was slow incoming; it was singular
enough, on which account I will here transcribe it.
"The departure of Madam d'Epinay is postponed; her son is ill, and
it is necessary to wait until his health is re-established. I will consider
the contents of your letter. Remain quiet at your Hermitage. I will
send you my opinion as soon as this shall be necessary. As she will
certainly not set off for some days, there is no immediate occasion

for it. In the meantime you may, if you think proper, make her your
offers, although this to me seems a matter of indifference. For,
knowing your situation as well as you do yourself, I doubt not of her
returning to your offer such an answer as she ought to do; and all the
advantage which, in my opinion, can result from this, will be your
having it in your power to say to those by whom you may be
importuned, that your not being of the travelling party was not for
want of having made your offers to that effect. Moreover, I do not see
why you will absolutely have it that the philosopher is the speakingtrumpet of all the world, nor because he is of opinion you ought to
go, why you should imagine all your friends think as he does? If you
write to Madam d'Epinay, her answer will be yours to all your friends,
since you have it so much at heart to give them all an answer. Adieu.
I embrace Madam le Vasseur and the Criminal."
[M. le Vasseur, whose wife governed him rather rudely, called
her
the Lieutenant Criminal. Grimm in a joke gave the same name
to the
daughter, and by way of abridgment was pleased to retrench the
first
word.]
Struck with astonishment at reading this letter I vainly endeavored
to find out what it meant. How! instead of answering me with
simplicity, he took time to consider of what I had written, as if the
time he had already taken was not sufficient! He intimates even the
state of suspense in which he wishes to keep me, as if a profound
problem was to be resolved, or that it was of importance to his views
to deprive me of every means of comprehending his intentions until
the moment he should think proper to make them known. What
therefore did he mean by these precautions, delays, and mysteries?
Was this manner of acting consistent with honor and uprightness? I
vainly sought for some favorable interpretation of his conduct; it was
impossible to find one. Whatever his design might be, were this
inimical to me, his situation facilitated the execution of it without its
being possible for me in mine to oppose the least obstacle. In favor

in the house of a great prince, having an extensive acquaintance,
and giving the tone to common circles of which he was the oracle, he
had it in his power, with his usual address, to dispose everything in
his favor; and I, alone in my Hermitage, far removed from all society,
without the benefit of advice, and having no communication with the
world, had nothing to do but to remain in peace. All I did was to write
to Madam d'Epinay upon the illness of her son, as polite a letter as
could be written, but in which I did not fall into the snare of offering to
accompany her to Geneva.
After waiting for a long time in the most cruel uncertainty, into
which that barbarous man had plunged me, I learned, at the
expiration of eight or ten days, that Madam d'Epinay was setoff, and
received from him a second letter. It contained not more than seven
or eight lines which I did not entirely read. It was a rupture, but in
such terms as the most infernal hatred only can dictate, and these
became unmeaning by the excessive degree of acrimony with which
he wished to charge them. He forbade me his presence as he would
have forbidden me his states. All that was wanting to his letter to
make it laughable, was to be read over with coolness. Without taking
a copy of it, or reading the whole of the contents, I returned it him
immediately, accompanied by the following note:
"I refused to admit the force of the just reasons I had of suspicion:
I now, when it is too late, am become sufficiently acquainted with
your character.
"This then is the letter upon which you took time to meditate: I
return it to you, it is not for me. You may show mine to the whole
world and hate me openly; this on your part will be a falsehood the
less."
My telling he might show my preceding letter related to an article
in his by which his profound address throughout the whole affair will
be judged of.
I have observed that my letter might inculpate me in the eyes of
persons unacquainted with the particulars of what had passed. This
he was delighted to discover; but how was he to take advantage of it
without exposing himself? By showing the letter he ran the risk of
being reproached with abusing the confidence of his friend.

To relieve himself from this embarrassment he resolved to break
with me in the most violent manner possible, and to set forth in his
letter the favor he did me in not showing mine. He was certain that in
my indignation and anger I should refuse his feigned discretion, and
permit him to show my letter to everybody; this was what he wished
for, and everything turned out as he expected it would. He sent my
letter all over Paris, with his own commentaries upon it, which,
however, were not so successful as he had expected them to be. It
was not judged that the permission he had extorted to make my
letter public exempted him from the blame of having so lightly taken
me at my word to do me an injury. People continually asked what
personal complaints he had against me to authorize so violent a
hatred. Finally, it was thought that if even my behavior had been
such as to authorize him to break with me, friendship, although
extinguished, had rights which he ought to have respected. But
unfortunately the inhabitants of Paris are frivolous; remarks of the
moment are soon forgotten; the absent and unfortunate are
neglected; the man who prospers secures favor by his presence; the
intriguing and malicious support each other, renew their vile efforts,
and the effects of these, incessantly succeeding each other, efface
everything by which they were preceded.
Thus, after having so long deceived me, this man threw aside his
mask; convinced that, in the state to which he had brought things, he
no longer stood in need of it. Relieved from the fear of being unjust
towards the wretch, I left him to his reflections, and thought no more
of him. A week afterwards I received an answer from Madam
d'Epinay, dated from Geneva. I understood from the manner of her
letter, in which for the first time in her life, she put on airs of state
with me, that both depending but little upon the success of their
measures, and considering me a man inevitably lost, their intentions
were to give themselves the pleasure of completing my destruction.
In fact, my situation was deplorable. I perceived all my friends
withdrew themselves from me without knowing how or for why.
Diderot, who boasted of the continuation of his attachment, and who,
for three months past, had promised me a visit, did not come. The
winter began to make its appearance, and brought with it my habitual
disorders. My constitution, although vigorous, had been unequal to

the combat of so many opposite passions. I was so exhausted that I
had neither strength nor courage sufficient to resist the most trifling
indisposition. Had my engagements; and the continued
remonstrances of Diderot and Madam de Houdetot then permitted
me to quit the Hermitage, I knew not where to go, nor in what
manner to drag myself along. I remained stupid and immovable. The
idea alone of a step to take, a letter to write, or a word to say, made
me tremble. I could not however do otherwise than reply to the letter
of Madam d'Epinay without acknowledging myself to be worthy of
the treatment with which she and her friend overwhelmed me. I
determined upon notifying to her my sentiments and resolutions, not
doubting a moment that from humanity, generosity, propriety, and the
good manner of thinking, I imagined I had observed in her,
notwithstanding her bad one, she would immediately subscribe to
them. My letter was as follows:
HERMITAGE

d NOV.,

.

"Were it possible to die of grief I should not now be alive.
"But I have at length determined to triumph over everything.
Friendship, madam, is extinguished between us, but that which no
longer exists still has its rights, and I respect them.
"I have not forgotten your goodness to me, and you may, on my
part, expect as much gratitude as it is possible to have towards a
person I no longer can love. All further explanation would be useless.
I have in my favor my own conscience, and I return you your letter.
"I wished to quit the Hermitage, and I ought to have done it. My
friends pretend I must stay there until spring; and since my friends
desire it I will remain there until that season if you will consent to my
stay."
After writing and despatching this letter all I thought of was
remaining quiet at the Hermitage and taking care of my health; of
endeavoring to recover my strength, and taking measures to remove
in the spring without noise or making the rupture public. But these
were not the intentions either of Grimm or Madam d'Epinay, as it will
presently appear.

A few days afterwards, I had the pleasure of receiving from
Diderot the visit he had so frequently promised, and in which he had
as constantly failed. He could not have come more opportunely; he
was my oldest friend: almost the only one who remained to me; the
pleasure I felt in seeing him, as things were circumstanced, may
easily be imagined. My heart was full, and I disclosed it to him. I
explained to him several facts which either had not come to his
knowledge, or had been disguised or suppressed. I informed him, as
far as I could do it with propriety, of all that had passed. I did not
affect to conceal from him that with which he was but too well
acquainted, that a passion equally unreasonable and unfortunate,
had been the cause of my destruction; but I never acknowledged
that Madam d'Houdetot had been made acquainted with it, or at
least that I had declared it to her. I mentioned to him the unworthy
manoeuvres of Madam d' Epinay to intercept the innocent letters her
sister-in-law wrote to me. I was determined he should hear the
particulars from the mouth of the persons whom she had attempted
to seduce. Theresa related them with great precision; but what was
my astonishment when the mother came to speak, and I heard her
declare and maintain that nothing of this had come to her
knowledge? These were her words from which she would never
depart. Not four days before she herself had recited to me all the
particulars Theresa had just stated, and in presence of my friend she
contradicted me to my face. This, to me, was decisive, and I then
clearly saw my imprudence in having so long a time kept such a
woman near me. I made no use of invective; I scarcely deigned to
speak to her a few words of contempt. I felt what I owed to the
daughter, whose steadfast uprightness was a perfect contrast to the
base monoeuvres of the mother. But from the instant my resolution
was taken relative to the old woman, and I waited for nothing but the
moment to put it into execution.
This presented itself sooner than I expected. On the th of
December I received from Madam d'Epinay the following answer to
my preceding letter:
GENEVA, st December,

.

"After having for several years given you every possible mark of
friendship all I can now do is to pity you. You are very unhappy. I
wish your conscience may be as calm as mine. This may be
necessary to the repose of your whole life.
"Since you are determined to quit the Hermitage, and are
persuaded that you ought to do it, I am astonished your friends have
prevailed upon you to stay there. For my part I never consult mine
upon my duty, and I have nothing further to say to you upon your
own."
Such an unforeseen dismission, and so fully pronounced, left me
not a moment to hesitate. It was necessary to quit immediately, let
the weather and my health be in what state they might, although I
were to sleep in the woods and upon the snow, with which the
ground was then covered, and in defiance of everything Madam
d'Houdetot might say; for I was willing to do everything to please her
except render myself infamous.
I never had been so embarrassed in my whole life as I then was;
but my resolution was taken. I swore, let what would happen, not to
sleep at the Hermitage on the night of that day week. I began to
prepare for sending away my effects, resolving to leave them in the
open field rather than not give up the key in the course of the week:
for I was determined everything should be done before a letter could
be written to Geneva, and an answer to it received. I never felt
myself so inspired with courage: I had recovered all my strength.
Honor and indignation, upon which Madam d'Epinay had not
calculated, contributed to restore me to vigor. Fortune aided my
audacity. M. Mathas, fiscal procurer, heard of my embarrasament.
He sent to offer me a little house he had in his garden of Mont Louis,
at Montmorency. I accepted it with eagerness and gratitude. The
bargain was soon concluded: I immediately sent to purchase a little
furniture to add to that we already had. My effects I had carted away
with a deal of trouble, and a great expense: notwithstanding the ice
and snow my removal was completed in a couple of days, and on
the fifteenth of December I gave up the keys of the Hermitage, after
having paid the wages of the gardener, not being able to pay my
rent.

With respect to Madam le Vasseur, I told her we must part; her
daughter attempted to make me renounce my resolution, but I was
inflexible. I sent her off, to Paris in a carriage of the messenger with
all the furniture and effects she and her daughter had in common. I
gave her some money, and engaged to pay her lodging with her
children, or elsewhere to provide for her subsistence as much as it
should be possible for me to do it, and never to let her want bread as
long as I should have it myself.
Finally the day after my arrival at Mont Louis, I wrote to Madam
d'Epinay the following letter:
MONTMORENCY,

th December

.

"Nothing, madam, is so natural and necessary as to leave your
house the moment you no longer approve of my remaining there.
Upon you refusing your consent to my passing the rest of the winter
at the Hermitage I quitted it on the fifteenth of December. My destiny
was to enter it in spite of myself and to leave it the same. I thank you
for the residence you prevailed upon me to make there, and I would
thank you still more had I paid for it less dear. You are right in
believing me unhappy; nobody upon earth knows better than
yourself to what a degree I must be so. If being deceived in the
choice of our friends be a misfortune, it is another not less cruel to
recover from so pleasing an error."
Such is the faithful narrative of my residence at the Hermitage,
and of the reasons which obliged me to leave it. I could not break off
the recital, it was necessary to continue it with the greatest
exactness; this epoch of my life having had upon the rest of it an
influence which will extend to my latest remembrance.

The extraordinary degree of strength a momentary effervescence
had given me to quit the Hermitage, left me the moment I was out of
it. I was scarcely established in my new habitation before I frequently
suffered from retentions, which were accompanied by a new
complaint; that of a rupture, from which I had for some time, without
knowing what it was, felt great inconvenience. I soon was reduced to
the most cruel state. The physician Thieiry, my old friend, came to
see me, and made me acquainted with my situation. The sight of all
the apparatus of the infirmities of years, made me severely feel that
when the body is no longer young, the heart is not so with impunity.
The fine season did not restore me, and I passed the whole year,
, in a state of languor, which made me think I was almost at the
end of my career. I saw, with impatience, the closing scene
approach. Recovered from the chimeras of friendship, and detached
from everything which had rendered life desirable to me, I saw
nothing more in it that could make it agreeable; all I perceived was
wretchedness and misery, which prevented me from enjoying myself.
I sighed after the moment when I was to be free and escape from my
enemies. But I must follow the order of events.
My retreat to Montmorency seemed to disconcert Madam
d'Epinay; probably she did not expect it. My melancholy situation,
the severity of the season, the general dereliction of me by my
friends, all made her and Grimm believe, that by driving me to the
last extremity, they should oblige me to implore mercy, and thus, by
vile meanness, render myself contemptible, to be suffered to remain
in an asylum which honor commanded me to leave. I left it so
suddenly that they had not time to prevent the step from being taken,

and they were reduced to the alternative of double or quit, to
endeavor to ruin me entirely, or to prevail upon me to return. Grimm
chose the former; but I am of opinion Madam d'Epinay would have
preferred the latter, and this from her answer to my last letter, in
which she seemed to have laid aside the airs she had given herself
in the preceding ones, and to give an opening to an accommodation.
The long delay of this answer, for which she made me wait a whole
month, sufficiently indicates the difficulty she found in giving it a
proper turn, and the deliberations by which it was preceded. She
could not make any further advances without exposing herself; but
after her former letters, and my sudden retreat from her house, it is
impossible not to be struck with the care she takes in this letter not to
suffer an offensive expression to escape her. I will copy it at length to
enable my reader to judge of what she wrote:
GENEVA, January

,

.

"SIR: I did not receive your letter of the th of December until
yesterday. It was sent me in a box filled with different things, and
which has been all this time upon the road. I shall answer only the
postscript. You may recollect, sir, that we agreed the wages of the
gardener of the Hermitage should pass through your hands, the
better to make him feel that he depended upon you, and to avoid the
ridiculous and indecent scenes which happened in the time of his
predecessor. As a proof of this, the first quarter of his wages were
given to you, and a few days before my departure we agreed I
should reimburse you what you had advanced. I know that of this
you, at first, made some difficulty; but I had desired you to make
these advances; it was natural I should acquit myself towards you,
and this we concluded upon. Cahouet informs me that you refused to
receive the money. There is certainly some mistake in the matter. I
have given orders that it may again be offered to you, and I see no
reason for your wishing to pay my gardener, notwithstanding our
conventions, and beyond the term even of your inhabiting the
Hermitage. I therefore expect, sir, that recollecting everything I have
the honor to state, you will not refuse to be reimbursed for the sums
you have been pleased to advance for me."

After what had passed, not having the least confidence in Madam
d' Epinay, I was unwilling to renew my connection with her; I returned
no answer to this letter, and there our correspondence ended.
Perceiving I had taken my resolution, she took hers; and, entering
into all the views of Grimm and the Coterie Holbachique, she united
her efforts with theirs to accomplish my destruction. Whilst they
manoevured at Paris, she did the same at Geneva. Grimm, who
afterwards went to her there, completed what she had begun.
Tronchin, whom they had no difficulty in gaining over, seconded
them powerfully, and became the most violent of my persecutors,
without having against me, any more than Grimm had, the least
subject of complaint. They all three spread in silence that of which
the effects were seen there four years afterwards.
They had more trouble at Paris, where I was better known to the
citizens, whose hearts, less disposed to hatred, less easily received
its impressions. The better to direct their blow, they began by giving
out that it was I who had left them. Thence, still feigning to be my
friends, they dexterously spread their malignant accusations by
complaining of the injustice of their friend. Their auditors, thus thrown
off their guard, listened more attentively to what was said of me, and
were inclined to blame my conduct. The secret accusations of
perfidy and ingratitude were made with greater precaution, and by
that means with greater effect. I knew they imputed to me the most
atrocious crimes without being able to learn in what these consisted.
All I could infer from public rumor was that this was founded upon
the four following capital offences: my retiring to the country; my
passion for Madam d'Houdetot; my refusing to accompany Madam
d'Epinay to Geneva, and my leaving the Hermitage. If to these they
added other griefs, they took their measures so well that it has
hitherto been impossible for me to learn the subject of them.
It is therefore at this period that I think I may fix the establishment
of a system, since adopted by those by whom my fate has been
determined, and which has made such a progress as will seem
miraculous to persons who know not with what facility everything
which favors the malignity of man is established. I will endeavor to
explain in a few words what to me appeared visible in this profound
and obscure system.

With a name already distinguished and known throughout all
Europe, I had still preserved my primitive simplicity. My mortal
aversion to all party faction and cabal had kept me free and
independent, without any other chain than the attachments of my
heart. Alone, a stranger, without family or fortune, and unconnected
with everything except my principles and duties, I intrepidly followed
the paths of uprightness, never flattering or favoring any person at
the expense of truth and justice. Besides, having lived for two years
past in solitude, without observing the course of events, I was
unconnected with the affairs of the world, and not informed of what
passed, nor desirous of being acquainted with it. I lived four leagues
from Paris as much separated from that. capital by my negligence as
I should have been in the Island of Tinian by the sea.
Grimm, Diderot and D'Holbach were, on the contrary, in the centre
of the vortex, lived in the great world, and divided amongst them
almost all the spheres of it. The great wits, men of letters, men of
long robe, and women, all listened to them when they chose to act in
concert. The advantage three men in this situation united must have
over a fourth in mine, cannot but already appear. It is true Diderot
and D'Holbach were incapable, at least I think so, of forming black
conspiracies; one of them was not base enough, nor the other
sufficiently able; but it was for this reason that the party was more
united. Grimm alone formed his plan in his own mind, and
discovered more of it than was necessary to induce his associates to
concur in the execution. The ascendency he had gained over them
made this quite easy, and the effect of the whole answered to the
superiority of his talents.
It was with these, which were of a superior kind, that, perceiving
the advantage he might acquire from our respective situations, he
conceived the project of overturning my reputation, and, without
exposing himself, of giving me one of a nature quite opposite, by
raising up about me an edifice of obscurity which it was impossible
for me to penetrate, and by that means throw a light upon his
manoevures and unmask him.
This enterprise was difficult, because it was necessary to palliate
the iniquity in the eyes of those of whose assistance he stood in
need. He had honest men to deceive, to alienate from me the good

opinion of everybody, and to deprive me of all my friends. What say
I? He had to cut off all communication with me, that not a single word
of truth might reach my ears. Had a single man of generosity come
and said to me, "You assume the appearance of virtue, yet this is the
manner in which you are treated, and these the circumstances by
which you are judged: what have you to say?" truth would have
triumphed and Grimm have been undone. Of this he was fully
convinced; but he had examined his own heart and estimated men
according to their merit. I am sorry, for the honor of humanity, that he
judged with so much truth.
In these dark and crooked paths his steps to be the more sure
were necessarily slow. He has for twelve years pursued his plan and
the most difficult part of the execution of it is still to come; this is to
deceive the public entirely. He is afraid of this public, and dares not
lay his conspiracy open.
[Since this was written he has made the dangerous step
with the
fullest and most inconceivable success. I am of opinion it
was
Tronchin who inspired him with courage, and supplied him
with the
means.]
But he has found the easy means of accompanying it with power,
and this power has the disposal of me. Thus supported he advances
with less danger. The agents of power piquing themselves but little
on uprightness, and still less on candor, he has no longer the
indiscretion of an honest man to fear. His safety is in my being
enveloped in an impenetrable obscurity, and in concealing from me
his conspiracy, well knowing that with whatever art he may have
formed it, I could by a single glance of the eye discover the whole.
His great address consists in appearing to favor whilst he defames
me, and in giving to his perfidy an air of generosity.
I felt the first effects of this system by the secret accusations of the
Coterie Holbachiens without its being possible for me to know in
what the accusations consisted, or to form a probable conjecture as

to the nature of them. De Leyre informed me in his letters that
heinous things were attributed to me. Diderot more mysteriously told
me the same thing, and when I came to an explanation with both, the
whole was reduced to the heads of accusation of which I have
already spoken. I perceived a gradual increase of coolness in the
letters from Madam d'Houdetot. This I could not attribute to Saint
Lambert; he continued to write to me with the same friendship, and
came to see me after his return. It was also impossible to think
myself the cause of it, as we had separated well satisfied with each
other, and nothing since that time had happened on my part, except
my departure from the Hermitage, of which she felt the necessity.
Therefore, not knowing whence this coolness, which she refused to
acknowledge, although my heart was not to be deceived, could
proceed, I was uneasy upon every account. I knew she greatly
favored her sister-in-law and Grimm, in consequence of their
connections with Saint Lambert; and I was afraid of their
machinations. This agitation opened my wounds, and rendered my
correspondence so disagreeable as quite to disgust her with it. I saw,
as at a distance, a thousand cruel circumstances, without
discovering anything distinctly. I was in a situation the most
insupportable to a man whose imagination is easily heated. Had I
been quite retired from the world, and known nothing of the matter I
should have become more calm; but my heart still clung to
attachments, by means of which my enemies had great advantages
over me; and the feeble rays which penetrated my asylum conveyed
to me nothing more than a knowledge of the blackness of the
mysteries which were concealed from my eyes.
I should have sunk, I have not a doubt of it, under these torments,
too cruel and insupportable to my open disposition, which, by the
impossibility of concealing my sentiments, makes me fear everything
from those concealed from me, if fortunately objects sufficiently
interesting to my heart to divert it from others with which, in spite of
myself, my imagination was filled, had not presented themselves. In
the last visit Diderot paid me, at the Hermitage, he had spoken of the
article 'Geneva', which D'Alembert had inserted in the 'Encyclopedie';
he had informed me that this article, concerted with people of the
first consideration, had for object the establishment of a theatre at

Geneva, that measures had been taken accordingly, and that the
establishment would soon take place. As Diderot seemed to think all
this very proper, and did not doubt of the success of the measure,
and as I had besides to speak to him upon too many other subjects
to touch upon that article, I made him no answer: but scandalized at
these preparatives to corruption and licentiousness in my country, I
waited with impatience for the volume of the 'Encyclopedie', in which
the article was inserted; to see whether or not it would be possible to
give an answer which might ward off the blow. I received the volume
soon after my establishment at Mont Louis, and found the articles to
be written with much art and address, and worthy of the pen whence
it proceeded. This, however, did not abate my desire to answer it,
and notwithstanding the dejection of spirits I then labored under, my
griefs and pains, the severity of the season, and the inconvenience
of my new abode, in which I had not yet had time to arrange myself, I
set to work with a zeal which surmounted every obstacle.
In a severe winter, in the month of February, and in the situation I
have described, I went every day, morning and evening, to pass a
couple of hours in an open alcove which was at the bottom of the
garden in which my habitation stood. This alcove, which terminated
an alley of a terrace, looked upon the valley and the pond of
Montmorency, and presented to me, as the closing point of a
prospect, the plain but respectable castle of St. Gratien, the retreat
of the virtuous Catinat. It was in this place, then, exposed to freezing
cold, that without being sheltered from the wind and snow, and
having no other fire than that in my heart; I composed, in the space
of three weeks, my letter to D'Alembert on theatres. It was in this, for
my 'Eloisa' was not then half written, that I found charms in
philosophical labor. Until then virtuous indignation had been a
substitute to Apollo, tenderness and a gentleness of mind now
became so. The injustice I had been witness to had irritated me, that
of which I became the object rendered me melancholy; and this
melancholy without bitterness was that of a heart too tender and
affectionate, and which, deceived by those in whom it had confided,
was obliged to remain concentred. Full of that which had befallen
me, and still affected by so many violent emotions, my heart added
the sentiment of its sufferings to the ideas with which a meditation on

my subject had inspired me; what I wrote bore evident marks of this
mixture. Without perceiving it I described the situation I was then in,
gave portraits of Grimm, Madam d'Epinay, Madam d' Houdetot, Saint
Lambert and myself. What delicious tears did I shed as I wrote! Alas!
in these descriptions there are proofs but too evident that love, the
fatal love of which I made such efforts to cure myself, still remained
in my heart. With all this there was a certain sentiment of tenderness
relative to myself; I thought I was dying, and imagined I bid the public
my last adieu. Far from fearing death, I joyfully saw it approach; but I
felt some regret at leaving my fellow creatures without their having
perceived my real merit, and being convinced how much I should
have deserved their esteem had they known me better. These are
the secret causes of the singular manner in which this work, opposite
to that of the work by which it was preceded, is written.--[Discours
sur l'Inegalite. Discourse on the Inequality of Mankind.]
I corrected and copied the letter, and was preparing to print it
when, after a long silence, I received one from Madam d'Houdetot,
which brought upon me a new affliction more painful than any I had
yet suffered. She informed me that my passion for her was known to
all Paris, that I had spoken of it to persons who had made it public,
that this rumor, having reached the ears of her lover, had nearly cost
him his life; yet he did her justice, and peace was restored between
them; but on his account, as well as on hers, and for the sake of her
reputation, she thought it her duty to break off all correspondence
with me, at the same time assuring me that she and her friend were
both interested in my welfare, that they would defend me to the
public, and that she herself would, from time to time, send to inquire
after my health.
"And thou also, Diderot," exclaimed I, "unworthy friend!"
I could not, however, yet resolve to condemn him. My weakness
was known to others who might have spoken of it. I wished to doubt,
but this was soon out of my power. Saint Lambert shortly after
performed an action worthy of himself. Knowing my manner of
thinking, he judged of the state in which I must be; betrayed by one
part of my friends and forsaken by the other. He came to see me.
The first time he had not many moments to spare. He came again.
Unfortunately, not expecting him, I was not at home. Theresa had

with him a conversation of upwards of two hours, in which they
informed each other of facts of great importance to us all. The
surprise with which I learned that nobody doubted of my having lived
with Madam d'Epinay, as Grimm then did, cannot be equalled,
except by that of Saint Lambert, when he was convinced that the
rumor was false. He, to the great dissatisfaction of the lady, was in
the same situation with myself, and the eclaircissements resulting
from the conversation removed from me all regret, on account of my
having broken with her forever. Relative to Madam d'Houdetot, he
mentioned several circumstances with which neither Theresa nor
Madam d'Houdetot herself were acquainted; these were known to
me only in the first instance, and I had never mentioned them except
to Diderot, under the seal of friendship; and it was to Saint Lambert
himself to whom he had chosen to communicate them. This last step
was sufficient to determine me. I resolved to break with Diderot
forever, and this without further deliberation, except on the manner of
doing it; for I had perceived secret ruptures turned to my prejudice,
because they left the mask of friendship in possession of my most
cruel enemies.
The rules of good breeding, established in the world on this head,
seem to have been dictated by a spirit of treachery and falsehood.
To appear the friend of a man when in reality we are no longer so, is
to reserve to ourselves the means of doing him an injury by
surprising honest men into an error. I recollected that when the
illustrious Montesquieu broke with Father de Tournemine, he
immediately said to everybody: "Listen neither to Father Tournemine
nor myself, when we speak of each other, for we are no longer
friends." This open and generous proceeding was universally
applauded. I resolved to follow the example with Diderot; but what
method was I to take to publish the rupture authentically from my
retreat, and yet without scandal? I concluded on inserting in the form
of a note, in my work, a passage from the book of Ecclesiasticus,
which declared the rupture and even the subject of it, in terms
sufficiently clear to such as were acquainted with the previous
circumstances, but could signify nothing to the rest of the world. I
determined not to speak in my work of the friend whom I renounced,

except with the honor always due to extinguished friendship. The
whole may be seen in the work itself.
There is nothing in this world but time and misfortune, and every
act of courage seems to be a crime in adversity. For that which has
been admired in Montesquieu, I received only blame and reproach.
As soon as my work was printed, and I had copies of it, I sent one to
Saint Lambert, who, the evening before, had written to me in his own
name and that of Madam d' Houdetot, a note expressive of the most
tender friendship.
The following is the letter he wrote to me when he returned the
copy I had sent him.
EAUBONNE,

th October,

.

"Indeed, sir, I cannot accept the present you have just made me.
In that part of your preface where, relative to Diderot, you quote a
passage from Ecclesiastes (he mistakes, it is from Ecclesiasticus)
the book dropped from my hand. In the conversations we had
together in the summer, you seemed to be persuaded Diderot was
not guilty of the pretended indiscretions you had imputed to him. You
may, for aught I know to the contrary, have reason to complain of
him, but this does not give you a right to insult him publicly. You are
not unacquainted with the nature of the persecutions he suffers, and
you join the voice of an old friend to that of envy. I cannot refrain
from telling you, sir, how much this heinous act of yours has shocked
me. I am not acquainted with Diderot, but I honor him, and I have a
lively sense of the pain you give to a man, whom, at least not in my
hearing, you have never reproached with anything more than a
trifling weakness. You and I, sir, differ too much in our principles ever
to be agreeable to each other. Forget that I exist; this you will easily
do. I have never done to men either good or evil of a nature to be
long remembered. I promise you, sir, to forget your person and to
remember nothing relative to you but your talents."
This letter filled me with indignation and affliction; and, in the
excess of my pangs, feeling my pride wounded, I answered him by
the following note:

MONTMORUNCY,

th October,

.

"SIR: While reading your letter, I did you the honor to be surprised
at it, and had the weakness to suffer it to affect me; but I find it
unworthy of an answer.
"I will no longer continue the copies of Madam d'Houdetot. If it be
not agreeable to her to keep that she has, she may sent it me back
and I will return her money. If she keeps it, she must still send for the
rest of her paper and the money; and at the same time I beg she will
return me the prospectus which she has in her possession. Adieu,
sir."
Courage under misfortune irritates the hearts of cowards, but it is
pleasing to generous minds. This note seemed to make Saint
Lambert reflect with himself and to regret his having been so violent;
but too haughty in his turn to make open advances, he seized and
perhaps prepared, the opportunity of palliating what he had done.
A fortnight afterwards I received from Madam d'Epinay the
following letter:
Thursday,

th.

"SIR: I received the book you had the goodness to send me, and
which I have read with much pleasure. I have always experienced
the same sentiment in reading all the works which have come from
your pen. Receive my thanks for the whole. I should have returned
you these in person had my affairs permitted me to remain any time
in your neighborhood; but I was not this year long at the Chevrette.
M. and Madam Dupin come there on Sunday to dinner. I expect M.
de Saint Lambert, M. de Francueil, and Madam d'Houdetot will be of
the party; you will do me much pleasure by making one also. All the
persons who are to dine with me, desire, and will, as well as myself,
be delighted to pass with you a part of the day. I have the honor to
be with the most perfect consideration," etc.
This letter made my heart beat violently; after having for a year
past been the subject of conversation of all Paris, the idea of
presenting myself as a spectacle before Madam d'Houdetot, made
me tremble, and I had much difficulty to find sufficient courage to

support that ceremony. Yet as she and Saint Lambert were desirous
of it, and Madam d'Epinay spoke in the name of her guests without
naming one whom I should not be glad to see, I did not think I should
expose myself accepting a dinner to which I was in some degree
invited by all the persons who with myself were to partake of it. I
therefore promised to go: on Sunday the weather was bad, and
Madam D'Epinay sent me her carriage.
My arrival caused a sensation. I never met a better reception. An
observer would have thought the whole company felt how much I
stood in need of encouragement. None but French hearts are
susceptible of this kind of delicacy. However, I found more people
than I expected to see. Amongst others the Comte d' Houdetot,
whom I did not know, and his sister Madam de Blainville, without
whose company I should have been as well pleased. She had the
year before came several times to Eaubonne, and her sister-in-law
had left her in our solitary walks to wait until she thought proper to
suffer her to join us. She had harbored a resentment against me,
which during this dinner she gratified at her ease. The presence of
the Comte d' Houdetot and Saint Lambert did not give me the laugh
on my side, and it may be judged that a man embarrassed in the
most common conversations was not very brilliant in that which then
took place. I never suffered so much, appeared so awkward, or
received more unexpected mortifications. As soon as we had risen
from table, I withdrew from that wicked woman; I had the pleasure of
seeing Saint Lambert and Madam de'Houdetot approach me, and
we conversed together a part of the afternoon, upon things very
indifferent it is true, but with the same familiarity as before my
involuntary error. This friendly attention was not lost upon my heart,
and could Saint Lambert have read what passed there, he certainly
would have been satisfied with it. I can safely assert that although on
my arrival the presence of Madam d'Houdetot gave me the most
violent palpitations, on returning from the house I scarcely thought of
her; my mind was entirely taken up with Saint Lambert.
Notwithstanding the malignant sarcasms of Madam de Blainville,
the dinner was of great service to me, and I congratulated myself
upon not having refused the invitation. I not only discovered that the
intrigues of Grimm and the Holbachiens had not deprived me of my

old acquaintance, but, what flattered me still more, that Madam
d'Houdetot and Saint Lambert were less changed than I had
imagined, and I at length understood that his keeping her at a
distance from me proceeded more from jealousy than from
disesteem.
[Such is the simplicity of my heart was my opinion when I
wrote
these confessions.]
This was a consolation to me, and calmed my mind. Certain of not
being an object of contempt in the eyes of persons whom I
esteemed, I worked upon my own heart with greater courage and
success. If I did not quite extinguish in it a guilty and an unhappy
passion, I at least so well regulated the remains of it that they have
never since that moment led me into the most trifling error. The
copies of Madam d' Houdetot, which she prevailed upon me to take
again, and my works, which I continued to send her as soon as they
appeared, produced me from her a few notes and messages,
indifferent but obliging. She did still more, as will hereafter appear,
and the reciprocal conduct of her lover and myself, after our
intercourse had ceased, may serve as an example of the manner in
which persons of honor separate when it is no longer agreeable to
them to associate with each other.
Another advantage this dinner procured me was its being spoken
of in Paris, where it served as a refutation of the rumor spread by my
enemies, that I had quarrelled with every person who partook of it,
and especially with M. d'Epinay. When I left the Hermitage I had
written him a very polite letter of thanks, to which he answered not
less politely, and mutual civilities had continued, as well between us
as between me and M. de la Lalive, his brother-in-law, who even
came to see me at Montmorency, and sent me some of his
engravings. Excepting the two sisters-in-law of Madam d'Houdetot, I
have never been on bad terms with any person of the family.
My letter to D'Alembert had great success. All my works had been
very well received, but this was more favorable to me. It taught the
public to guard against the insinuations of the Coterie Holbachique.

When I went to the Hermitage, this Coterie predicted with its usual
sufficiency, that I should not remain there three months. When I had
stayed there twenty months, and was obliged to leave it, I still fixed
my residence in the country. The Coterie insisted this was from a
motive of pure obstinacy, and that I was weary even to death of my
retirement; but that, eaten up with pride, I chose rather to become a
victim of my stubbornness than to recover from it and return to Paris.
The letter to D'Alembert breathed a gentleness of mind which every
one perceived not to be affected. Had I been dissatisfied with my
retreat, my style and manner would have borne evident marks of my
ill-humor. This reigned in all the works I had written in Paris; but in
the first I wrote in the country not the least appearance of it was to
be found. To persons who knew how to distinguish, this remark was
decisive. They perceived I was returned to my element.
Yet the same work, notwithstanding all the mildness it breathed,
made me by a mistake of my own and my usual ill-luck, another
enemy amongst men of letters. I had become acquainted with
Marmontel at the house of M. de la Popliniere, and his acquaintance
had been continued at that of the baron. Marmontel at that time
wrote the 'Mercure de France'. As I had too much pride to send my
works to the authors of periodical publications, and wishing to send
him this without his imagining it was in consequence of that title, or
being desirous he should speak of it in the Mercure, I wrote upon the
book that it was not for the author of the Mercure, but for M.
Marmontel. I thought I paid him a fine compliment; he mistook it for a
cruel offence, and became my irreconcilable enemy. He wrote
against the letter with politeness, it is true, but with a bitterness
easily perceptible, and since that time has never lost an opportunity
of injuring me in society, and of indirectly ill-treating me in his works.
Such difficulty is there in managing the irritable self-love of men of
letters, and so careful ought every person to be not to leave anything
equivocal in the compliments they pay them.
Having nothing more to disturb me, I took advantage of my leisure
and independence to continue my literary pursuits with more
coherence. I this winter finished my Eloisa, and sent it to Rey, who
had it printed the year following. I was, however, interrupted in my
projects by a circumstance sufficiently disagreeable. I heard new

preparations were making at the opera-house to give the 'Devin du
Village'. Enraged at seeing these people arrogantly dispose of my
property, I again took up the memoir I had sent to M. D'Argenson, to
which no answer had been returned, and having made some trifling
alterations in it, I sent the manuscript by M. Sellon, resident from
Geneva, and a letter with which he was pleased to charge himself, to
the Comte de St. Florentin, who had succeeded M. D'Argenson in
the opera department. Duclos, to whom I communicated what I had
done, mentioned it to the 'petits violons', who offered to restore me,
not my opera, but my freedom of the theatre, which I was no longer
in a situation to enjoy. Perceiving I had not from any quarter the least
justice to expect, I gave up the affair; and the directors of the opera,
without either answering or listening to my reasons, have continued
to dispose as of their own property, and to turn to their profit, the
Devin du Village, which incontestably belong to nobody but myself.
Since I had shaken off the yoke of my tyrants, I led a life
sufficiently agreeable and peaceful; deprived of the charm of too
strong attachments I was delivered from the weight of their chains.
Disgusted with the friends who pretended to be my protectors, and
wished absolutely to dispose of me at will, and in spite of myself, to
subject me to their pretended good services, I resolved in future to
have no other connections than those of simple benevolence. These,
without the least constraint upon liberty, constitute the pleasure of
society, of which equality is the basis. I had of them as many as were
necessary to enable me to taste of the charm of liberty without being
subject to the dependence of it; and as soon as I had made an
experiment of this manner of life, I felt it was the most proper to my
age, to end my days in peace, far removed from the agitations,
quarrels and cavillings in which I had just been half submerged.
During my residence at the Hermitage, and after my settlement at
Montmorency, I had made in the neighborhood some agreeable
acquaintance, and which did not subject me to any inconvenience.
The principal of these was young Loiseau de Mauleon, who, then
beginning to plead at the bar, did not yet know what rank he would
one day hold there. I for my part was not in the least doubt about the
matter. I soon pointed out to him the illustrious career in the midst of
which he is now seen, and predicted that, if he laid down to himself

rigid rules for the choice of causes, and never became the defender
of anything but virtue and justice, his genius, elevated by this
sublime sentiment, would be equal to that of the greatest orators. He
followed my advice, and now feels the good effects of it. His defence
of M. de Portes is worthy of Demosthenes. He came every year
within a quarter of a league of the Hermitage to pass the vacation at
St. Brice, in the fife of Mauleon, belonging to his mother, and where
the great Bossuet had formerly lodged. This is a fief, of which a like
succession of proprietors would render nobility difficult to support.
I had also for a neighbor in the same village of St. Brice, the
bookseller Guerin, a man of wit, learning, of an amiable disposition,
and one of the first in his profession. He brought me acquainted with
Jean Neaulme, bookseller of Amsterdam, his friend and
correspondent, who afterwards printed Emilius.
I had another acquaintance still nearer than St. Brice, this was M.
Maltor, vicar of Groslay, a man better adapted for the functions of a
statesman and a minister, than for those of the vicar of a village, and
to whom a diocese at least would have been given to govern if
talents decided the disposal of places. He had been secretary to the
Comte de Luc, and was formerly intimately acquainted with Jean
Bapiste Rousseau. Holding in as much esteem the memory of that
illustrious exile, as he held the villain who ruined him in horror; he
possessed curious anecdotes of both, which Segur had not inserted
in the life, still in manuscript, of the former, and he assured me that
the Comte de Luc, far from ever having had reason to complain of
his conduct, had until his last moment preserved for him the warmest
friendship. M. Maltor, to whom M. de Vintimille gave this retreat after
the death of his patron, had formerly been employed in many affairs
of which, although far advanced in years, he still preserved a distinct
remembrance, and reasoned upon them tolerably well. His
conversation, equally amusing and instructive, had nothing in it
resembling that of a village pastor: he joined the manners of a man
of the world to the knowledge of one who passes his life in study. He,
of all my permanent neighbors, was the person whose society was
the most agreeable to me.
I was also acquainted at Montmorency with several fathers of the
oratory, and amongst others Father Berthier, professor of natural

philosophy; to whom, notwithstanding some little tincture of pedantry,
I become attached on account of a certain air of cordial good nature
which I observed in him. I had, however, some difficulty to reconcile
this great simplicity with the desire and the art he had of everywhere
thrusting himself into the company of the great, as well as that of the
women, devotees, and philosophers. He knew how to accommodate
himself to every one. I was greatly pleased with the man, and spoke
of my satisfaction to all my other acquaintances. Apparently what I
said of him came to his ear. He one day thanked me for having
thought him a good-natured man. I observed something in his forced
smile which, in my eyes, totally changed his physiognomy, and which
has since frequently occurred to my mind. I cannot better compare
this smile than to that of Panurge purchasing the Sheep of
Dindenaut. Our acquaintance had begun a little time after my arrival
at the Hermitage, to which place he frequently came to see me. I
was already settled at Montmorency when he left it to go and reside
at Paris. He often saw Madam le Vasseur there. One day, when I
least expected anything of the kind, he wrote to me in behalf of that
woman, informing me that Grimm offered to maintain her, and to ask
my permission to accept the offer. This I understood consisted in a
pension of three hundred livres, and that Madam le Vasseur was to
come and live at Deuil, between the Chevrette and Montmorency. I
will not say what impression the application made on me. It would
have been less surprising had Grimm had ten thousand livres a year,
or any relation more easy to comprehend with that woman, and had
not such a crime been made of my taking her to the country, where,
as if she had become younger, he was now pleased to think of
placing her. I perceived the good old lady had no other reason for
asking my permission, which she might easily have done without, but
the fear of losing what I already gave her, should I think ill of the step
she took. Although this charity appeared to be very extraordinary, it
did not strike me so much then as afterwards. But had I known even
everything I have since discovered, I should still as readily have
given my consent as I did and was obliged to do, unless I had
exceeded the offer of M. Grimm. Father Berthier afterwards cured
me a little of my opinion of his good nature and cordiality, with which
I had so unthinkingly charged him.

This same Father Berthier was acquainted with two men, who, for
what reason I know not, were to become so with me; there was but
little similarity between their taste and mine. They were the children
of Melchisedec, of whom neither the country nor the family was
known, no more than, in all probability, the real name. They were
Jansenists, and passed for priests in disguise, perhaps on account
of their ridiculous manner of wearing long swords, to which they
appeared to have been fastened. The prodigious mystery in all their
proceedings gave them the appearance of the heads of a party, and
I never had the least doubt of their being the authors of the 'Gazette
Ecclesiastique'. The one, tall, smooth-tongued, and sharping, was
named Ferrand; the other, short, squat, a sneerer, and punctilious,
was a M. Minard. They called each other cousin. They lodged at
Paris with D'Alembert, in the house of his nurse named Madam
Rousseau, and had taken at Montmorency a little apartment to pass
the summers there. They did everything for themselves, and had
neither a servant nor runner; each had his turn weekly to purchase
provisions, do the business of the kitchen, and sweep the house.
They managed tolerably well, and we sometimes ate with each
other. I know not for what reason they gave themselves any concern
about me: for my part, my only motive for beginning an acquaintance
with them was their playing at chess, and to make a poor little party I
suffered four hours' fatigue. As they thrust themselves into all
companies, and wished to intermeddle in everything, Theresa called
them the gossips, and by this name they were long known at
Montmorency.
Such, with my host M. Mathas, who was a good man, were my
principal country acquaintance. I still had a sufficient number at Paris
to live there agreeably whenever I chose it, out of the sphere of men
of letters, amongst whom Duclos, was the only friend I reckoned: for
De Levre was still too young, and although, after having been a
witness to the manoeuvres of the philosophical tribe against me, he
had withdrawn from it, at least I thought so, I could not yet forget the
facility with which he made himself the mouthpiece of all the people
of that description.
In the first place I had my old and respectable friend Roguin. This
was a good old-fashioned friend for whom I was not indebted to my

writings but to myself, and whom for that reason I have always
preserved. I had the good Lenieps, my countryman, and his
daughter, then alive, Madam Lambert. I had a young Genevese,
named Coindet, a good creature, careful, officious, zealous, who
came to see me soon after I had gone to reside at the Hermitage,
and, without any other introducer than himself, had made his way
into my good graces. He had a taste for drawing, and was
acquainted with artists. He was of service to me relative to the
engravings of the New Eloisa; he undertook the direction of the
drawings and the plates, and acquitted himself well of the
commission.
I had free access to the house of M. Dupin, which, less brilliant
than in the young days of Madam Dupin, was still, by the merit of the
heads of the family, and the choice of company which assembled
there, one of the best houses in Paris. As I had not preferred
anybody to them, and had separated myself from their society to live
free and independent, they had always received me in a friendly
manner, and I was always certain of being well received by Madam
Dupin. I might even have counted her amongst my country
neighbors after her establishment at Clichy, to which place I
sometimes went to pass a day or two, and where I should have been
more frequently had Madam Dupin and Madam de Chenonceaux
been upon better terms. But the difficulty of dividing my time in the
same house between two women whose manner of thinking was
unfavorable to each other, made this disagreeable: however I had
the pleasure of seeing her more at my ease at Deuil, where, at a
trifling distance from me, she had taken a small house, and even at
my own habitation, where she often came to see me.
I had likewise for a friend Madam de Crequi, who, having become
devout, no longer received D'Alembert, Marmontel, nor a single man
of letters, except, I believe the Abbe Trublet, half a hypocrite, of
whom she was weary. I, whose acquaintance she had sought lost
neither her good wishes nor intercourse. She sent me young fat
pullets from Mons, and her intention was to come and see me the
year following had not a journey, upon which Madam de Luxembourg
determined, prevented her. I here owe her a place apart; she will
always hold a distinguished one in my remembrance.

In this list I should also place a man whom, except Roguin, I ought
to have mentioned as the first upon it; my old friend and brother
politician, De Carrio, formerly titulary secretary to the embassy from
Spain to Venice, afterwards in Sweden, where he was charge des
affaires, and at length really secretary to the embassy from Spain at
Paris. He came and surprised me at Montmorency when I least
expected him. He was decorated with the insignia of a Spanish
order, the name of which I have forgotten, with a fine cross in
jewelry. He had been obliged, in his proofs of nobility, to add a letter
to his name, and to bear that of the Chevalier de Carrion. I found him
still the same man, possessing the same excellent heart, and his
mind daily improving, and becoming more and more amiable. We
would have renewed our former intimacy had not Coindet interposed
according to custom, taken advantage of the distance I was at from
town to insinuate himself into my place, and, in my name, into his
confidence, and supplant me by the excess of his zeal to render me
services.
The remembrance of Carrion makes me recollect one of my
country neighbors, of whom I should be inexcusable not to speak, as
I have to make confession of an unpardonable neglect of which I
was guilty towards him: this was the honest M. le Blond, who had
done me a service at Venice, and, having made an excursion to
France with his family, had taken a house in the country, at Birche,
not far from Montmorency.
[When I wrote this, full of my blind confidence, I was far from
suspecting the real motive and the effect of his journey to Paris.]
As soon as I heard he was my neighbor, I, in the joy of my heart,
and making it more a pleasure than a duty, went to pay him a visit. I
set off upon this errand the next day. I was met by people who were
coming to see me, and with whom I was obliged to return. Two days
afterwards I set off again for the same purpose: he had dined at
Paris with all his family. A third time he was at home: I heard the
voice of women, and saw, at the door, a coach which alarmed me. I
wished to see him, at least for the first time, quite at my ease, that
we might talk over what had passed during our former connection.

In fine, I so often postponed my visit from day to day, that the
shame of discharging a like duty so late prevented me from doing it
at all; after having dared to wait so long, I no longer dared to present
myself. This negligence, at which M. le Blond could not but be justly
offended, gave, relative to him, the appearance of ingratitude to my
indolence, and yet I felt my heart so little culpable that, had it been in
my power to do M. le Blond the least service, even unknown to
himself, I am certain he would not have found me idle. But indolence,
negligence and delay in little duties to be fulfilled have been more
prejudicial to me than great vices. My greatest faults have been
omissions: I have seldom done what I ought not to have done, and
unfortunately it has still more rarely happened that I have done what
I ought.
Since I am now upon the subject of my Venetian acquaintance, I
must not forget one which I still preserved for a considerable time
after my intercourse with the rest had ceased. This was M. de
Joinville, who continued after his return from Genoa to show me
much friendship. He was fond of seeing me and of conversing with
me upon the affairs of Italy, and the follies of M. de Montaigu, of
whom he of himself knew many anecdotes, by means of his
acquaintance in the office for foreign affairs in which he was much
connected. I had also the pleasure of seeing at my house my old
comrade Dupont who had purchased a place in the province of
which he was, and whose affairs had brought him to Paris. M. de
Joinville became by degrees so desirous of seeing me, that he in
some measure laid me under constraint; and, although our places of
residence were at a great distance from each other, we had a
friendly quarrel when I let a week pass without going to dine with
him. When he went to Joinville he was always desirous of my
accompanying him; but having once been there to pass a week I had
not the least desire to return. M. de Joinville was certainly an honest
man, and even amiable in certain respects but his understanding
was beneath mediocrity; he was handsome, rather fond of his
person and tolerably fatiguing. He had one of the most singular
collections perhaps in the world, to which he gave much of his
attention and endeavored to acquire it that of his friends, to whom it
sometimes afforded less amusement than it did to himself. This was

a complete collection of songs of the court and Paris for upwards of
fifty years past, in which many anecdotes were to be found that
would have been sought for in vain elsewhere. These are memoirs
for the history of France, which would scarcely be thought of in any
other country.
One day, whilst we were still upon the very best terms, he received
me so coldly and in a manner so different from that which was
customary to him, that after having given him an opportunity to
explain, and even having begged him to do it, I left his house with a
resolution, in which I have persevered, never to return to it again; for
I am seldom seen where I have been once ill received, and in this
case there was no Diderot who pleaded for M. de Joinville. I vainly
endeavored to discover what I had done to offend him; I could not
recollect a circumstance at which he could possibly have taken
offence. I was certain of never having spoken of him or his in any
other than in the most honorable manner; for he had acquired my
friendship, and besides my having nothing but favorable things to
say of him, my most inviolable maxim has been that of never
speaking but in an honorable manner of the houses I frequented.
At length, by continually ruminating. I formed the following
conjecture: the last time we had seen each other, I had supped with
him at the apartment of some girls of his acquaintance, in company
with two or three clerks in the office of foreign affairs, very amiable
men, and who had neither the manner nor appearance of libertines;
and on my part, I can assert that the whole evening passed in
making melancholy reflections on the wretched fate of the creatures
with whom we were. I did not pay anything, as M. de Joinville gave
the supper, nor did I make the girls the least present, because I gave
them not the opportunity I had done to the padoana of establishing a
claim to the trifle I might have offered, We all came away together,
cheerfully and upon very good terms. Without having made a second
visit to the girls, I went three or four days afterwards to dine with M.
de Joinville, whom I had not seen during that interval, and who gave
me the reception of which I have spoken. Unable to suppose any
other cause for it than some misunderstanding relative to the supper,
and perceiving he had no inclination to explain, I resolved to visit him
no longer, but I still continued to send him my works: he frequently

sent me his compliments, and one evening, meeting him in the
green-room of the French theatre, he obligingly reproached me with
not having called to see him, which, however, did not induce me to
depart from my resolution. Therefore this affair had rather the
appearance of a coolness than a rupture. However, not having heard
of nor seen him since that time, it would have been too late after an
absence of several years, to renew my acquaintance with him. It is
for this reason M. de Joinville is not named in my list, although I had
for a considerable time frequented his house.
I will not swell my catalogue with the names of many other
persons with whom I was or had become less intimate, although I
sometimes saw them in the country, either at my own house or that
of some neighbor, such for instance as the Abbes de Condillac and
De Malby, M. de Mairan, De la Lalive, De Boisgelou, Vatelet,
Ancelet, and others. I will also pass lightly over that of M. de
Margency, gentleman in ordinary of the king, an ancient member of
the 'Coterie Holbachique', which he had quitted as well as myself,
and the old friend of Madam d'Epinay from whom he had separated
as I had done; I likewise consider that of M. Desmahis, his friend, the
celebrated but short-lived author of the comedy of the Impertinent, of
much the same importance. The first was my neighbor in the
country, his estate at Margency being near to Montmorency. We
were old acquaintances, but the neighborhood and a certain
conformity of experience connected us still more. The last died soon
afterwards. He had merit and even wit, but he was in some degree
the original of his comedy, and a little of a coxcomb with women, by
whom he was not much regretted.

I cannot, however, omit taking notice of a new correspondence I
entered into at this period, which has had too much influence over
the rest of my life not to make it necessary for me to mark its origin.
The person in question is De Lamoignon de Malesherbes of the
'Cour des aides', then censor of books, which office he exercised
with equal intelligence and mildness, to the great satisfaction of men
of letters. I had not once been to see him at Paris; yet I had never
received from him any other than the most obliging condescensions
relative to the censorship, and I knew that he had more than once
very severely reprimanded persons who had written against me. I

had new proofs of his goodness upon the subject of the edition of
Eloisa. The proofs of so great a work being very expensive from
Amsterdam by post, he, to whom all letters were free, permitted
these to be addressed to him, and sent them to me under the
countersign of the chancellor his father. When the work was printed
he did not permit the sale of it in the kingdom until, contrary to my
wishes an edition had been sold for my benefit. As the profit of this
would on my part have been a theft committed upon Rey, to whom I
had sold the manuscript, I not only refused to accept the present
intended me, without his consent, which he very generously gave,
but persisted upon dividing with him the hundred pistoles (a
thousand livres--forty pounds), the amount of it but of which he
would not receive anything. For these hundred pistoles I had the
mortification, against which M. de Malesherbes had not guarded me,
of seeing my work horribly mutilated, and the sale of the good edition
stopped until the bad one was entirely disposed of.
I have always considered M. de Malesherbes as a man whose
uprightness was proof against every temptation. Nothing that has
happened has even made me doubt for a moment of his probity; but,
as weak as he is polite, he sometimes injures those he wishes to
serve by the excess of his zeal to preserve them from evil. He not
only retrenched a hundred pages in the edition of Paris, but he made
another retrenchment, which no person but the author could permit
himself to do, in the copy of the good edition he sent to Madam de
Pompadour. It is somewhere said in that work that the wife of a coalheaver is more respectable than the mistress of a prince. This
phrase had occurred to me in the warmth of composition without any
application. In reading over the work I perceived it would be applied,
yet in consequence of the very imprudent maxim I had adopted of
not suppressing anything, on account of the application which might
be made, when my conscience bore witness to me that I had not
made them at the time I wrote, I determined not to expunge the
phrase, and contented myself with substituting the word Prince to
King, which I had first written. This softening did not seem sufficient
to M. de Malesherbes: he retrenched the whole expression in a new
sheet which he had printed on purpose and stuck in between the
other with as much exactness as possible in the copy of Madam de

Pompadour. She was not ignorant of this manoeuvre. Some goodnatured people took the trouble to inform her of it. For my part, it was
not until a long time afterwards, and when I began to feel the
consequences of it, that the matter came to my knowledge.
Is not this the origin of the concealed but implacable hatred of
another lady who was in a like situation, without my knowing it, or
even being acquainted with her person when I wrote the passage?
When the book was published the acquaintance was made, and I
was very uneasy. I mentioned this to the Chevalier de Lorenzy, who
laughed at me, and said the lady was so little offended that she had
not even taken notice of the matter. I believed him, perhaps rather
too lightly, and made myself easy when there was much reason for
my being otherwise.
At the beginning of the winter I received an additional mark of the
goodness of M. de Malesherbes of which I was very sensible,
although I did not think proper to take advantage of it. A place was
vacant in the 'Journal des Savans'. Margency wrote to me, proposing
to me the place, as from himself. But I easily perceived from the
manner of the letter that he was dictated to and authorized; he
afterwards told me he had been desired to make me the offer. The
occupations of this place were but trifling. All I should have had to do
would have been to make two abstracts a month, from the books
brought to me for that purpose, without being under the necessity of
going once to Paris, not even to pay the magistrate a visit of thanks.
By this employment I should have entered a society of men of letters
of the first merit; M. de Mairan, Clairaut, De Guignes and the Abbe
Barthelemi, with the first two of whom I had already made an
acquaintance, and that of the two others was very desirable. In fine,
for this trifling employment, the duties of which I might so
commodiously have discharged, there was a salary of eight hundred
livres (thirty-three pounds); I was for a few hours undecided, and this
from a fear of making Margency angry and displeasing M. de
Malesherbes. But at length the insupportable constraint of not having
it in my power to work when I thought proper, and to be commanded
by time; and moreover the certainty of badly performing the functions
with which I was to charge myself, prevailed over everything, and
determined me to refuse a place for which I was unfit. I knew that my

whole talent consisted in a certain warmth of mind with respect to the
subjects of what I had to treat, and that nothing but the love of that
which was great, beautiful and sublime, could animate my genius.
What would the subjects of the extracts I should have had to make
from books, or even the books themselves, have signified to me? My
indifference about them would have frozen my pen, and stupefied
my mind. People thought I could make a trade of writing, as most of
the other men of letters did, instead of which I never could write but
from the warmth of imagination. This certainly was not necessary for
the 'Journal des Savans'. I therefore wrote to Margency a letter of
thanks, in the politest terms possible, and so well explained to him
my reasons, that it was not possible that either he or M. de
Malesherbes could imagine there was pride or ill-humor in my
refusal. They both approved of it without receiving me less politely,
and the secret was so well kept that it was never known to the
public.
The proposition did not come in a favorable moment. I had some
time before this formed the project of quitting literature, and
especially the trade of an author. I had been disgusted with men of
letters by everything that had lately befallen me, and had learned
from experience that it was impossible to proceed in the same track
without having some connections with them. I was not much less
dissatisfied with men of the world, and in general with the mixed life I
had lately led, half to myself and half devoted to societies for which I
was unfit. I felt more than ever, and by constant experience, that
every unequal association is disadvantageous to the weaker person.
Living with opulent people, and in a situation different from that I had
chosen, without keeping a house as they did, I was obliged to imitate
them in many things; and little expenses, which were nothing to their
fortunes, were for me not less ruinous than indispensable. Another
man in the country-house of a friend, is served by his own servant,
as well at table as in his chamber; he sends him to seek for
everything he wants; having nothing directly to do with the servants
of the house, not even seeing them, he gives them what he pleases,
and when he thinks proper; but I, alone, and without a servant, was
at the mercy of the servants of the house, of whom it was necessary
to gain the good graces, that I might not have much to suffer; and

being treated as the equal of their master, I was obliged to treat them
accordingly, and better than another would have done, because, in
fact, I stood in greater need of their services. This, where there are
but few domestics, may be complied with; but in the houses I
frequented there were a great number, and the knaves so well
understood their interests that they knew how to make me want the
services of them all successively. The women of Paris, who have so
much wit, have no just idea of this inconvenience, and in their zeal to
economize my purse they ruined me. If I supped in town, at any
considerable distance from my lodgings, instead of permitting me to
send for a hackney coach, the mistress of the house ordered her
horses to be put to and sent me home in her carriage. She was very
glad to save me the twenty-four sous (shilling) for the fiacre, but
never thought of the half-crown I gave to her coachman and
footman. If a lady wrote to me from Paris to the Hermit age or to
Montmorency, she regretted the four sous (two pence) the postage
of the letter would have cost me, and sent it by one of her servants,
who came sweating on foot, and to whom I gave a dinner and half a
crown, which he certainly had well earned. If she proposed to me to
pass with her a week or a fortnight at her country-house, she still
said to herself, "It will be a saving to the poor man; during that time
his eating will cost him nothing." She never recollected that I was the
whole time idle, that the expenses of my family, my rent, linen and
clothes were still going on, that I paid my barber double that it cost
me more being in her house than in my own, and although I confined
my little largesses to the house in which I customarily lived, that
these were still ruinous to me. I am certain I have paid upwards of
twenty-five crowns in the house of Madam d'Houdetot, at Raubonne,
where I never slept more than four or five times, and upwards of a
thousand livres (forty pounds) as well at Epinay as at the Chevrette,
during the five or six years I was most assiduous there. These
expenses are inevitable to a man like me, who knows not how to
provide anything for himself, and cannot support the sight of a lackey
who grumbles and serves him with a sour look. With Madam Dupin,
even where I was one of the family, and in whose house I rendered
many services to the servants, I never received theirs but for my
money. In course of time it was necessary to renounce these little

liberalities, which my situation no longer permitted me to bestow, and
I felt still more severely the inconvenience of associating with people
in a situation different from my own.
Had this manner of life been to my taste, I should have been
consoled for a heavy expense, which I dedicated to my pleasures;
but to ruin myself at the same time that I fatigued my mind, was
insupportable, and I had so felt the weight of this, that, profiting by
the interval of liberty I then had, I was determined to perpetuate it,
and entirely to renounce great companies, the composition of books,
and all literary concerns, and for the remainder of my days to confine
myself to the narrow and peaceful sphere in which I felt I was born to
move.
The produce of this letter to D'Alembert, and of the New Elosia,
had a little improved the state of my finances, which had been
considerably exhausted at the Hermitage. Emilius, to which, after I
had finished Eloisa, I had given great application, was in
forwardness, and the produce of this could not be less than the sum
of which I was already in possession. I intended to place this money
in such a manner as to produce me a little annual income, which,
with my copying, might be sufficient to my wants without writing any
more. I had two other works upon the stocks. The first of these was
my 'Institutions Politiques'. I examined the state of this work, and
found it required several years' labor. I had not courage enough to
continue it, and to wait until it was finished before I carried my
intentions into execution. Therefore, laying the book aside, I
determined to take from it all I could, and to burn the rest; and
continuing this with zeal without interrupting Emilius, I finished the
'Contrat Social'.
The dictionary of music now remained. This was mechanical, and
might be taken up at any time; the object of it was entirely pecuniary.
I reserved to myself the liberty of laying it aside, or of finishing it at
my ease, according as my other resources collected should render
this necessary or superfluous. With respect to the 'Morale Sensitive',
of which I had made nothing more than a sketch, I entirely gave it up.
As my last project, if I found I could not entirely do without copying,
was that of removing from Paris, where the affluence of my visitors
rendered my housekeeping expensive, and deprived me of the time I

should have turned to advantage to provide for it; to prevent in my
retirement the state of lassitude into which an author is said to fall
when he has laid down his pen, I reserved to myself an occupation
which might fill up the void in my solitude without tempting me to
print anything more. I know not for what reason they had long
tormented me to write the memoirs of my life. Although these were
not until that time interesting as to the facts, I felt they might become
so by the candor with which I was capable of giving them, and I
determined to make of these the only work of the kind, by an
unexampled veracity, that, for once at least, the world might see a
man such as he internally was. I had always laughed at the false
ingenuousness of Montaigne, who, feigning to confess his faults,
takes great care not to give himself any, except such as are amiable;
whilst I, who have ever thought, and still think myself, considering
everything, the best of men, felt there is no human being, however
pure he maybe, who does not internally conceal some odious vice. I
knew I was described to the public very different from what I really
was, and so opposite, that notwithstanding my faults, all of which I
was determined to relate, I could not but be a gainer by showing
myself in my proper colors. This, besides, not being to be done
without setting forth others also in theirs and the work for the same
reason not being of a nature to appear during my lifetime, and that of
several other persons, I was the more encouraged to make my
confession, at which I should never have to blush before any person.
I therefore resolved to dedicate my leisure to the execution of this
undertaking, and immediately began to collect such letters and
papers as might guide or assist my memory, greatly regretting the
loss of all I had burned, mislaid and destroyed.
The project of absolute retirement, one of the most reasonable I
had ever formed, was strongly impressed upon my mind, and for the
execution of it I was already taking measures, when Heaven, which
prepared me a different destiny, plunged me into a another vortex.
Montmorency, the ancient and fine patrimony of the illustrious
family of that name, was taken from it by confiscation. It passed by
the sister of Duke Henry, to the house of Conde, which has changed
the name of Montmorency to that of Enguien, and the duchy has no
other castle than an old tower, where the archives are kept, and to

which the vassals come to do homage. But at Montmorency, or
Enguien, there is a private house, built by Crosat, called 'le pauvre',
which having the magnificence of the most superb chateaux,
deserves and bears the name of a castle. The majestic appearance
of this noble edifice, the view from it, not equalled perhaps in any
country; the spacious saloon, painted by the hand of a master; the
garden, planted by the celebrated Le Notre; all combined to form a
whole strikingly majestic, in which there is still a simplicity that
enforces admiration. The Marechal Duke de Luxembourg who then
inhabited this house, came every year into the neighborhood where
formerly his ancestors were the masters, to pass, at least, five or six
weeks as a private inhabitant, but with a splendor which did not
degenerate from the ancient lustre of his family. On the first journey
he made to it after my residing at Montmorency, he and his lady sent
to me a valet de chambre, with their compliments, inviting me to sup
with them as often as it should be agreeable to me; and at each time
of their coming they never failed to reiterate the same compliments
and invitation. This called to my recollection Madam Beuzenval
sending me to dine in the servants' hall. Times were changed; but I
was still the same man. I did not choose to be sent to dine in the
servants' hall, and was but little desirous of appearing at the table of
the great I should have been much better pleased had they left me
as I was, without caressing me and rendering me ridiculous. I
answered politely and respectfully to Monsieur and Madam de
Luxembourg, but I did not accept their offers, and my indisposition
and timidity, with my embarrassment in speaking; making me
tremble at the idea alone of appearing in an assembly of people of
the court. I did not even go to the castle to pay a visit of thanks,
although I sufficiently comprehended this was all they desired, and
that their eager politeness was rather a matter of curiosity than
benevolence.
However, advances still were made, and even became more
pressing. The Countess de Boufflers, who was very intimate with the
lady of the marechal, sent to inquire after my health, and to beg I
would go and see her. I returned her a proper answer, but did not stir
from my house. At the journey of Easter, the year following,
, the
Chevalier de Lorenzy, who belonged to the court of the Prince of

Conti, and was intimate with Madam de Luxembourg, came several
times to see me, and we became acquainted; he pressed me to go
to the castle, but I refused to comply. At length, one afternoon, when
I least expected anything of the kind, I saw coming up to the house
the Marechal de Luxembourg, followed by five or six persons. There
was now no longer any means of defence; and I could not, without
being arrogant and unmannerly, do otherwise than return this visit,
and make my court to Madam la Marechale, from whom the
marechal had been the bearer of the most obliging compliments to
me. Thus, under unfortunate auspices, began the connections from
which I could no longer preserve myself, although a too well-founded
foresight made me afraid of them until they were made.
I was excessively afraid of Madam de Luxembourg. I knew, she
was amiable as to manner. I had seen her several times at the
theatre, and with the Duchess of Boufflers, and in the bloom of her
beauty; but she was said to be malignant; and this in a woman of her
rank made me tremble. I had scarcely seen her before I was
subjugated. I thought her charming, with that charm proof against
time and which had the most powerful action upon my heart. I
expected to find her conversation satirical and full of pleasantries
and points. It was not so; it was much better. The conversation of
Madam de Luxembourg is not remarkably full of wit; it has no sallies,
nor even finesse; it is exquisitely delicate, never striking, but always
pleasing. Her flattery is the more intoxicating as it is natural; it seems
to escape her involuntarily, and her heart to overflow because it is
too full. I thought I perceived, on my first visit, that notwithstanding
my awkward manner and embarrassed expression, I was not
displeasing to her. All the women of the court know how to persuade
us of this when they please, whether it be true or not, but they do not
all, like Madam de Luxembourg, possess the art of rendering that
persuasion so agreeable that we are no longer disposed ever to
have a doubt remaining. From the first day my confidence in her
would have been as full as it soon afterwards became, had not the
Duchess of Montmorency, her daughter-in-law, young, giddy, and
malicious also, taken it into her head to attack me, and in the midst
of the eulogiums of her mamma, and feigned allurements on her own

account, made me suspect I was only considered by them as a
subject of ridicule.
It would perhaps have been difficult to relieve me from this fear
with these two ladies had not the extreme goodness of the marechal
confirmed me in the belief that theirs was not real. Nothing is more
surprising, considering my timidity, than the promptitude with which I
took him at his word on the footing of equality to which he would
absolutely reduce himself with me, except it be that with which he
took me at mine with respect to the absolute independence in which
I was determined to live. Both persuaded I had reason to be content
with my situation, and that I was unwilling to change it, neither he nor
Madam de Luxembourg seemed to think a moment of my purse or
fortune; although I can have no doubt of the tender concern they had
for me, they never proposed to me a place nor offered me their
interest, except it were once, when Madam de Luxembourg seemed
to wish me to become a member of the French Academy. I alleged
my religion; this she told me was no obstacle, or if it was one she
engaged to remove it. I answered, that however great the honor of
becoming a member of so illustrious a body might be, having refused
M. de Tressan, and, in some measure, the King of Poland, to
become a member of the Academy at Nancy, I could not with
propriety enter into any other. Madam de Luxembourg did not insist,
and nothing more was said upon the subject. This simplicity of
intercourse with persons of such rank, and who had the power of
doing anything in my favor, M. de Luxembourg being, and highly
deserving to be, the particular friend of the king, affords a singular
contrast with the continual cares, equally importunate and officious,
of the friends and protectors from whom I had just separated, and
who endeavored less to serve me than to render me contemptible.
When the marechal came to see me at Mont Louis, I was uneasy
at receiving him and his retinue in my only chamber; not because I
was obliged to make them all sit down in the midst of my dirty plates
and broken pots, but on account of the state of the floor, which was
rotten and falling to ruin, and I was afraid the weight of his attendants
would entirely sink it. Less concerned on account of my own danger
than for that to which the affability of the marechal exposed him, I
hastened to remove him from it by conducting him, notwithstanding

the coldness of the weather, to my alcove, which was quite open to
the air, and had no chimney. When he was there I told him my
reason for having brought him to it; he told it to his lady, and they
both pressed me to accept, until the floor was repaired, a lodging of
the castle; or, if I preferred it, in a separate edifice called the Little
Castle which was in the middle of the park. This delightful abode
deserves to be spoken of.
The park or garden of Montmorency is not a plain, like that of the
Chevrette. It is uneven, mountainous, raised by little hills and valleys,
of which the able artist has taken advantage; and thereby varied his
groves, ornaments, waters, and points of view, and, if I may so
speak, multiplied by art and genius a space in itself rather narrow.
This park is terminated at the top by a terrace and the castle; at
bottom it forms a narrow passage which opens and becomes wider
towards the valley, the angle of which is filled up with a large piece of
water. Between the orangery, which is in this widening, and the piece
of water, the banks of which are agreeably decorated, stands the
Little Castle of which I have spoken. This edifice, and the ground
about it, formerly belonged to the celebrated Le Brun, who amused
himself in building and decorating it in the exquisite taste of
architectual ornaments which that great painter had formed to
himself. The castle has since been rebuilt, but still, according to the
plan and design of its first master. It is little and simple, but elegant.
As it stands in a hollow between the orangery and the large piece of
water, and consequently is liable to be damp, it is open in the middle
by a peristyle between two rows of columns, by which means the air
circulating throughout the whole edifice keeps it dry, notwithstanding
its unfavorable situation. When the building is seen from the opposite
elevation, which is a point of view, it appears absolutely surrounded
with water, and we imagine we have before our eyes an enchanted
island, or the most beautiful of the three Boromeans, called Isola
Bella, in the greater lake.
In this solitary edifice I was offered the choice of four complete
apartments it contains, besides the ground floor, consisting of a
dancing room, billiard room and a kitchen. I chose the smallest over
the kitchen, which also I had with it. It was charmingly neat, with blue
and white furniture. In this profound and delicious solitude, in the

midst of the woods, the singing of birds of every kind, and the
perfume of orange flowers, I composed, in a continual ecstasy, the
fifth book of Emilius, the coloring of which I owe in a great measure
to the lively impression I received from the place I inhabited.
With what eagerness did I run every morning at sunrise to respire
the perfumed air in the peristyle! What excellent coffee I took there
tete-a-tete with my Theresa. My cat and dog were our company. This
retinue alone would have been sufficient for me during my whole life,
in which I should not have had one weary moment. I was there in a
terrestrial paradise; I lived in innocence and tasted of happiness.
At the journey of July, M. and Madam de Luxembourg showed me
so much attention, and were so extremely kind, that, lodged in their
house, and overwhelmed with their goodness, I could not do less
than make them a proper return in assiduous respect near their
persons; I scarcely quitted them; I went in the morning to pay my
court to Madam la Marechale; after dinner I walked with the
marechal; but did not sup at the castle on account of the numerous
guests, and because they supped too late for me. Thus far
everything was as it should be, and no harm would have been done
could I have remained at this point. But I have never known how to
preserve a medium in my attachments, and simply fulfil the duties of
society. I have ever been everything or nothing. I was soon
everything; and receiving the most polite attention from persons of
the highest rank, I passed the proper bounds, and conceived for
them a friendship not permitted except among equals. Of these I had
all the familiarity in my manners, whilst they still preserved in theirs
the same politeness to which they had accustomed me. Yet I was
never quite at my ease with Madam de Luxembourg. Although I was
not quite relieved from my fears relative to her character, I
apprehended less danger from it than from her wit. It was by this
especially that she impressed me with awe. I knew she was difficult
as to conversation, and she had a right to be so. I knew women,
especially those of her rank, would absolutely be amused, that it was
better to offend than to weary them, and I judged by her
commentaries upon what the people who went away had said what
she must think of my blunders. I thought of an expedient to spare me
with her the embarrassment of speaking; this was reading. She had

heard of my Eloisa, and knew it was in the press; she expressed a
desire to see the work; I offered to read it to her, and she accepted
my offer. I went to her every morning at ten o'clock; M. de
Luxembourg was present, and the door was shut. I read by the side
of her bed, and so well proportioned my readings that there would
have been sufficient for the whole time she had to stay, had they
even not been interrupted.
[The loss of a great battle, which much afflicted the King,
obliged M. de Luxembourg precipitately to return to court.]
The success of this expedient surpassed my expectation. Madam
de Luxembourg took a great liking to Julia and the author; she spoke
of nothing but me, thought of nothing else, said civil things to me
from morning till night, and embraced me ten times a day. She
insisted on me always having my place by her side at table, and
when any great lords wished it she told them it was mine, and made
them sit down somewhere else. The impression these charming
manners made upon me, who was subjugated by the least mark of
affection, may easily be judged of. I became really attached to her in
proportion to the attachment she showed me. All my fear in
perceiving this infatuation, and feeling the want of agreeableness in
myself to support it, was that it would be changed into disgust; and
unfortunately this fear was but too well founded.
There must have been a natural opposition between her turn of
mind and mine, since, independently of the numerous stupid things
which at every instant escaped me in conversation, and even in my
letters, and when I was upon the best terms with her, there were
certain other things with which she was displeased without my being
able to imagine the reason. I will quote one instance from among
twenty. She knew I was writing for Madam d'Houdetot a copy of the
New Eloisa. She was desirous to have one on the same footing. This
I promised her, and thereby making her one of my customers, I wrote
her a polite letter upon the subject, at least such was my intention.
Her answer, which was as follows, stupefied me with surprise.
VERSAILLES, Tuesday.

"I am ravished, I am satisfied: your letter has given me infinite
pleasure, and I take the earliest moment to acquaint you with, and
thank you for it.
"These are the exact words of your letter: 'Although you are
certainly a very good customer, I have some pain in receiving your
money: according to regular order I ought to pay for the pleasure I
should have in working for you.' I will say nothing more on the
subject. I have to complain of your not speaking of your state of
health: nothing interests me more. I love you with all my heart: and
be assured that I write this to you in a very melancholy mood, for I
should have much pleasure in telling it to you myself. M. de
Luxembourg loves and embraces you with all his heart.
"On receiving the letter I hastened to answer it, reserving to myself
more fully to examine the matter, protesting against all disobliging
interpretation, and after having given several days to this
examination with an inquietude which may easily be conceived, and
still without being able to discover in what I could have erred, what
follows was my final answer on the subject.
"MONTMORENCY, th December,

.

"Since my last letter I have examined a hundred times the
passage in question. I have considered it in its proper and natural
meaning, as well as in every other which may be given to it, and I
confess to you, madam, that I know not whether it be I who owe to
you excuses, or you from whom they are due to me."
It is now ten years since these letters were written. I have since
that time frequently thought of the subject of them; and such is still
my stupidity that I have hitherto been unable to discover what in the
passages, quoted from my letter, she could find offensive, or even
displeasing.
I must here mention, relative to the manuscript copy of Eloisa
Madam de Luxembourg wished to have, in what manner I thought to
give it some marked advantage which should distinguish it from all
others. I had written separately the adventures of Lord Edward, and
had long been undetermined whether I should insert them wholly, or
in extracts, in the work in which they seemed to be wanting. I at

length determined to retrench them entirely, because, not being in
the manner of the rest, they would have spoiled the interesting
simplicity, which was its principal merit. I had still a stronger reason
when I came to know Madam de Luxembourg: There was in these
adventures a Roman marchioness, of a bad character, some parts of
which, without being applicable, might have been applied to her by
those to whom she was not particularly known. I was therefore,
highly pleased with the determination to which I had come, and
resolved to abide by it. But in the ardent desire to enrich her copy
with something which was not in the other, what should I fall upon
but these unfortunate adventures, and I concluded on making an
extract from them to add to the work; a project dictated by madness,
of which the extravagance is inexplicable, except by the blind fatality
which led me on to destruction.
'Quos vult perdere Jupiter dementet.'
I was stupid enough to make this extract with the greatest care
and pains, and to send it her as the finest thing in the world; it is true,
I at the same time informed her the original was burned, which was
really the case, that the extract was for her alone, and would never
be seen, except by herself, unless she chose to show it; which, far
from proving, to her my prudence and discretion, as it was my
intention to do, clearly intimated what I thought of the application by
which she might be offended. My stupidity was such, that I had no
doubt of her being delighted with what I had done. She did not make
me the compliment upon it which I expected, and, to my great
surprise, never once mentioned the paper I had sent her. I was so
satisfied with myself, that it was not until a long time afterwards, I
judged, from other indications, of the effect it had produced.
I had still, in favor of her manuscript, another idea more
reasonable, but which, by more distant effects, has not been much
less prejudicial to me; so much does everything concur with the work
of destiny, when that hurries on a man to misfortune. I thought of
ornamenting the manuscript with the engravings of the New Eloisa,
which were of the same size. I asked Coindet for these engravings,
which belonged to me by every kind of title, and the more so as I had

given him the produce of the plates, which had a considerable sale.
Coindet is as cunning as I am the contrary. By frequently asking him
for the engravings he came to the knowledge of the use I intended to
make of them. He then, under pretence of adding some new
ornament, still kept them from me; and at length presented them
himself.
'Ego versiculos feci, tulit alter honores.'
This gave him an introduction upon a certain footing to the Hotel
de Luxembourg. After my establishment at the little castle he came
rather frequently to see me, and always in the morning, especially
when M. and Madam de Luxembourg were at Montmorency.
Therefore that I might pass the day with him, I did not go the castle.
Reproaches were made me on account of my absence; I told the
reason of them. I was desired to bring with me M. Coindet; I did so.
This was, what he had sought after. Therefore, thanks to the
excessive goodness M. and Madam de Luxembourg had for me, a
clerk to M. Thelusson, who was sometimes pleased to give him his
table when he had nobody else to dine with him, was suddenly
placed at that of a marechal of France, with princes, duchesses, and
persons of the highest rank at court. I shall never forget, that one day
being obliged to return early to Paris, the marechal said, after dinner,
to the company, "Let us take a walk upon the road to St. Denis, and
we will accompany M. Coindet." This was too much for the poor
man; his head was quite turned. For my part, my heart was so
affected that I could not say a word. I followed the company, weeping
like a child, and having the strongest desire to kiss the foot of the
good marechal; but the continuation of the history of the manuscript
has made me anticipate. I will go a little back, and, as far as my
memory will permit, mark each event in its proper order.
As soon as the little house of Mont Louis was ready, I had it neatly
furnished and again established myself there. I could not break
through the resolution I had made on quitting the Hermitage of
always having my apartment to myself; but I found a difficulty in
resolving to quit the little castle. I kept the key of it, and being
delighted with the charming breakfasts of the peristyle, frequently

went to the castle to sleep, and stayed three or four days as at a
country-house. I was at that time perhaps better and more agreeably
lodged than any private individual in Europe. My host, M. Mathas,
one of the best men in the world, had left me the absolute direction
of the repairs at Mont Louis, and insisted upon my disposing of his
workmen without his interference. I therefore found the means of
making of a single chamber upon the first story, a complete set of
apartments consisting of a chamber, antechamber, and a water
closet. Upon the ground-floor was the kitchen and the chamber of
Theresa. The alcove served me for a closet by means of a glazed
partition and a chimney I had made there. After my return to this
habitation, I amused myself in decorating the terrace, which was
already shaded by two rows of linden trees; I added two others to
make a cabinet of verdure, and placed in it a table and stone
benches: I surrounded it with lilies, syringa and woodbines, and had
a beautiful border of flowers parallel with the two rows of trees. This
terrace, more elevated than that of the castle, from which the view
was at least as fine, and where I had tamed a great number of birds,
was my drawing-room, in which I received M. and Madam de
Luxembourg, the Duke of Villeroy, the Prince of Tingry, the Marquis
of Armentieres, the Duchess of Montmorency, the Duchess of
Bouffiers, the Countess of Valentinois, the Countess of Boufflers,
and other persons of the first rank; who, from the castle disdained
not to make, over a very fatiguing mountain, the pilgrimage of Mont
Louis. I owed all these visits to the favor of M. and Madam de
Luxembourg; this I felt, and my heart on that account did them all
due homage. It was with the same sentiment that I once said to M.
de Luxembourg, embracing him: "Ah! Monsieur le Marechal, I hated
the great before I knew you, and I have hated them still more since
you have shown me with what ease they might acquire universal
respect." Further than this I defy any person with whom I was then
acquainted, to say I was ever dazzled for an instant with splendor, or
that the vapor of the incense I received ever affected my head; that I
was less uniform in my manner, less plain in my dress, less easy of
access to people of the lowest rank, less familiar with neighbors, or
less ready to render service to every person when I had it in my
power so to do, without ever once being discouraged by the

numerous and frequently unreasonable importunities with which I
was incessantly assailed.
Although my heart led me to the castle of Montmorency, by my
sincere attachment to those by whom it was inhabited, it by the same
means drew me back to the neighborhood of it, there to taste the
sweets of the equal and simple life, in which my only happiness
consisted. Theresa had contracted a friendship with the daughter of
one of my neighbors, a mason of the name of Pilleu; I did the same
with the father, and after having dined at the castle, not without some
constraint, to please Madam de Luxembourg, with what eagerness
did I return in the evening to sup with the good man Pilleu and his
family, sometimes at his own house and at others, at mine.
Besides my two lodgings in the country, I soon had a third at the
Hotel de Luxembourg, the proprietors of which pressed me so much
to go and see them there, that I consented, notwithstanding my
aversion to Paris, where, since my retiring to the Hermitage, I had
been but twice, upon the two occasions of which I have spoken. I did
not now go there except on the days agreed upon, solely to supper,
and the next morning I returned to the country. I entered and came
out by the garden which faces the boulevard, so that I could with the
greatest truth, say I had not set my foot upon the stones of Paris.
In the midst of this transient prosperity, a catastrophe, which was
to be the conclusion of it, was preparing at a distance. A short time
after my return to Mont Louis, I made there, and as it was customary,
against my inclination, a new acquaintance, which makes another
era in my private history. Whether this be favorable or unfavorable,
the reader will hereafter be able to judge. The person with whom I
became acquainted was the Marchioness of Verdelin, my neighbor,
whose husband had just bought a country-house at Soisy, near
Montmorency. Mademoiselle d'Ars, daughter to the Comte d'Ars, a
man of fashion, but poor, had married M. de Verdelin, old, ugly, deaf,
uncouth, brutal, jealous, with gashes in his face, and blind of one
eye, but, upon the whole, a good man when properly managed, and
in possession of a fortune of from fifteen to twenty thousand a year.
This charming object, swearing, roaring, scolding, storming, and
making his wife cry all day long, ended by doing whatever she
thought proper, and this to set her in a rage, because she knew how

to persuade him that it was he who would, and she would not have it
so. M. de Margency, of whom I have spoken, was the friend of
madam, and became that of monsieur. He had a few years before let
them his castle of Margency, near Eaubonne and Andilly, and they
resided there precisely at the time of my passion for Madam
d'Houdetot. Madam d'Houdetot and Madam de Verdelin became
acquainted with each other, by means of Madam d'Aubeterre their
common friend; and as the garden of Margency was in the road by
which Madam d'Houdetot went to Mont Olympe, her favorite walk,
Madam de Verdelin gave her a key that she might pass through it.
By means of this key I crossed it several times with her; but I did not
like unexpected meetings, and when Madam de Verdelin was by
chance upon our way I left them together without speaking to her,
and went on before. This want of gallantry must have made on her
an impression unfavorable to me. Yet when she was at Soisy she
was anxious to have my company. She came several times to see
me at Mont Louis, without finding me at home, and perceiving I did
not return her visit, took it into her head, as a means of forcing me to
do it, to send me pots of flowers for my terrace. I was under the
necessity of going to thank her; this was all she wanted, and we thus
became acquainted.
This connection, like every other I formed; or was led into contrary
to my inclination, began rather boisterously. There never reigned in it
a real calm. The turn of mind of Madam de Verdelinwas too opposite
to mine. Malignant expressions and pointed sarcasms came from
her with so much simplicity, that a continual attention too fatiguing for
me was necessary to perceive she was turning into ridicule the
person to whom she spoke. One trivial circumstance which occurs to
my recollection will be sufficient to give an idea of her manner. Her
brother had just obtained the command of a frigate cruising against
the English. I spoke of the manner of fitting out this frigate without
diminishing its swiftness of sailing. "Yes," replied she, in the most
natural tone of voice, "no more cannon are taken than are necessary
for fighting." I seldom have heard her speak well of any of her absent
friends without letting slip something to their prejudice. What she did
not see with an evil eye she looked upon with one of ridicule, and her
friend Margency was not excepted. What I found most insupportable

in her was the perpetual constraint proceeding from her little
messages, presents and billets, to which it was a labor for me to
answer, and I had continual embarrassments either in thanking or
refusing. However, by frequently seeing this lady I became attached
to her. She had her troubles as well as I had mine. Reciprocal
confidence rendered our conversations interesting. Nothing so
cordially attaches two persons as the satisfaction of weeping
together. We sought the company of each other for our reciprocal
consolation, and the want of this has frequently made me pass over
many things. I had been so severe in my frankness with her, that
after having sometimes shown so little esteem for her character, a
great deal was necessary to be able to believe she could sincerely
forgive me.
The following letter is a specimen of the epistles I sometimes
wrote to her, and it is to be remarked that she never once in any of
her answers to them seemed to be in the least degree piqued.
MONTMORENCY, th November,

.

"You tell me, madam, you have not well explained yourself, in
order to make me understand I have explained myself ill. You speak
of your pretended stupidity for the purpose of making me feel my
own. You boast of being nothing more than a good kind of woman,
as if you were afraid to being taken at your word, and you make me
apologies to tell me I owe them to you. Yes, madam, I know it; it is I
who am a fool, a good kind of man; and, if it be possible, worse than
all this; it is I who make a bad choice of my expressions in the
opinion of a fine French lady, who pays as much attention to words,
and speak as well as you do. But consider that I take them in the
common meaning of the language without knowing or troubling my
head about the polite acceptations in which they are taken in the
virtuous societies of Paris. If my expressions are sometimes
equivocal, I endeavored by my conduct to determine their meaning,"
etc. The rest of the letter is much the same.
Coindet, enterprising, bold, even to effrontery, and who was upon
the watch after all my friends, soon introduced himself in my name to
the house of Madam de Verdelin, and, unknown to me, shortly

became there more familiar than myself. This Coindet was an
extraordinary man. He presented himself in my name in the houses
of all my acquaintance, gained a footing in them, and eat there
without ceremony. Transported with zeal to do me service, he never
mentioned my name without his eyes being suffused with tears; but,
when he came to see me, he kept the most profound silence on the
subject of all these connections, and especially on that in which he
knew I must be interested. Instead of telling me what he had heard,
said, or seen, relative to my affairs, he waited for my speaking to
him, and even interrogated me. He never knew anything of what
passed in Paris, except that which I told him: finally, although
everybody spoke to me of him, he never once spoke to me of any
person; he was secret and mysterious with his friend only; but I will
for the present leave Coindet and Madam de Verdelin, and return to
them at a proper time.
Sometime after my return to Mont Louis, La Tour, the painter,
came to see me, and brought with him my portrait in crayons, which
a few years before he had exhibited at the salon. He wished to give
me this portrait, which I did not choose to accept. But Madam
d'Epinay, who had given me hers, and would have had this,
prevailed upon me to ask him for it. He had taken some time to
retouch the features. In the interval happened my rupture with
Madam d'Epinay; I returned her her portrait; and giving her mine
being no longer in question, I put it into my chamber, in the castle. M.
de Luxembourg saw it there, and found it a good one; I offered it
him, he accepted it, and I sent it to the castle. He and his lady
comprehended I should be very glad to have theirs. They had them
taken in miniature by a very skilful hand, set in a box of rock crystal,
mounted with gold, and in a very handsome manner, with which I
was delighted, made me a present of both. Madam de Luxenbourg
would never consent that her portrait should be on the upper part of
the box. She had reproached me several times with loving M. de
Luxembourg better than I did her; I had not denied it because it was
true. By this manner of placing her portrait she showed very politely,
but very clearly, she had not forgotten the preference.
Much about this time I was guilty of a folly which did not contribute
to preserve me to her good graces. Although I had no knowledge of

M. de Silhoutte, and was not much disposed to like him, I had a
great opinion of his administration. When he began to let his hand
fall rather heavily upon financiers, I perceived he did not begin his
operation in a favorable moment, but he had my warmest wishes for
his success; and as soon as I heard he was displaced I wrote to him,
in my intrepid, heedless manner, the following letter, which I certainly
do not undertake to justify.
MONTMORENCY, d December,

.

"Vouchsafe, sir, to receive the homage of a solitary man, who is
not known to you, but who esteems you for your talents, respects
you for your administration, and who did you the honor to believe
you would not long remain in it. Unable to save the State, except at
the expense of the capital by which it has been ruined, you have
braved the clamors of the gainers of money. When I saw you crush
these wretches, I envied you your place; and at seeing you quit it
without departing from your system, I admire you. Be satisfied with
yourself, sir; the step you have taken will leave you an honor you will
long enjoy without a competitor. The malediction of knaves is the
glory of an honest man."
Madam de Luxembourg, who knew I had written this letter, spoke
to me of it when she came into the country at Easter. I showed it to
her and she was desirous of a copy; this I gave her, but when I did it
I did not know she was interested in under-farms, and the displacing
of M. de Silhoutte. By my numerous follies any person would have
imagined I wilfully endeavored to bring on myself the hatred of an
amiable woman who had power, and to whom, in truth, I daily
became more attached, and was far from wishing to occasion her
displeasure, although by my awkward manner of proceeding, I did
everything proper for that purpose. I think it superfluous to remark
here, that it is to her the history of the opiate of M. Tronchin, of which
I have spoken in the first part of my memoirs, relates; the other lady
was Madam de Mirepoix. They have never mentioned to me the
circumstance, nor has either of them, in the least, seemed to have
preserved a remembrance of it; but to presume that Madam de
Luxembourg can possibly have forgotten it appears to me very

difficult, and would still remain so, even were the subsequent events
entirely unknown. For my part, I fell into a deceitful security relative
to the effects of my stupid mistakes, by an internal evidence of my
not having taken any step with an intention to offend; as if a woman
could ever forgive what I had done, although she might be certain
the will had not the least part in the matter.
Although she seemed not to see or feel anything, and that I did not
immediately find either her warmth of friendship diminished or the
least change in her manner, the continuation and even increase of a
too well founded foreboding made me incessantly tremble, lest
disgust should succeed to infatuation. Was it possible for me to
expect in a lady of such high rank, a constancy proof against my
want of address to support it? I was unable to conceal from her this
secret foreboding, which made me uneasy, and rendered me still
more disagreeable. This will be judged of by the following letter,
which contains a very singular prediction.
N. B. This letter, without date in my rough copy, was written in
October,
, at latest.
"How cruel is your goodness? Why disturb the peace of a solitary
mortal who had renounced the pleasures of life, that he might no
longer suffer the fatigues of them. I have passed my days in vainly
searching for solid attachments. I have not been able to form any in
the ranks to which I was equal; is it in yours that I ought to seek for
them? Neither ambition nor interest can tempt me: I am not vain, but
little fearful; I can resist everything except caresses. Why do you
both attack me by a weakness which I must overcome, because in
the distance by which we are separated, the over-flowings of
susceptible hearts cannot bring mine near to you? Will gratitude be
sufficient for a heart which knows not two manners of bestowing its
affections, and feels itself incapable of everything except friendship?
Of friendship, madam la marechale! Ah! there is my misfortune! It is
good in you and the marechal to make use of this expression; but I
am mad when I take you at your word. You amuse yourselves, and I
become attached; and the end of this prepares for me new regrets.
How I do hate all your titles, and pity you on account of your being
obliged to bear them? You seem to me to be so worthy of tasting the
charms of private life! Why do not you reside at Clarens? I would go

there in search of happiness; but the castle of Montmorency, and the
Hotel de Luxembourg! Is it in these places Jean Jacques ought to be
seen? Is it there a friend to equality ought to carry the affections of a
sensible heart, and who thus paying the esteem in which he is held,
thinks he returns as much as he receives? You are good and
susceptible also: this I know and have seen; I am sorry I was not
sooner convinced of it; but in the rank you hold, in the manner of
living, nothing can make a lasting impression; a succession of new
objects efface each other so that not one of them remains. You will
forget me, madam, after having made it impossible for me to imitate,
you. You have done a great deal to make me unhappy, to be
inexcusable."
I joined with her the marechal, to render the compliment less
severe; for I was moreover so sure of him, that I never had a doubt
in my mind of the continuation of his friendship. Nothing that
intimidated me in madam la marechale, ever for a moment extended
to him. I never have had the least mistrust relative to his character,
which I knew to be feeble, but constant. I no more feared a coldness
on his part than I expected from him an heroic attachment. The
simplicity and familiarity of our manners with each other proved how
far dependence was reciprocal. We were both always right: I shall
ever honor and hold dear the memory of this worthy man, and,
notwithstanding everything that was done to detach him from me, I
am as certain of his having died my friend as if I had been present in
his last moments.
At the second journey to Montmorency, in the year
, the
reading of Eloisa being finished, I had recourse to that of Emilius, to
support myself in the good graces of Madam de Luxembourg; but
this, whether the subject was less to her taste; or that so much
reading at length fatigued her, did not succeed so well. However, as
she reproached me with suffering myself to be the dupe of
booksellers, she wished me to leave to her care the printing the
work, that I might reap from it a greater advantage. I consented to
her doing it, on the express condition of its not being printed in
France, on which we had along dispute; I affirming that it was
impossible to obtain, and even imprudent to solicit, a tacit
permission; and being unwilling to permit the impression upon any

other terms in the kingdom; she, that the censor could not make the
least difficulty, according to the system government had adopted.
She found means to make M. de Malesherbes enter into her views.
He wrote to me on the subject a long letter with his own hand, to
prove the profession of faith of the Savoyard vicar to be a
composition which must everywhere gain the approbation of its
readers and that of the court, as things were then circumstanced. I
was surprised to see this magistrate, always so prudent, become so
smooth in the business, as the printing of a book was by that alone
legal, I had no longer any objection to make to that of the work. Yet,
by an extraordinary scruple, I still required it should be printed in
Holland, and by the bookseller Neaulme, whom, not satisfied with
indicating him, I informed of my wishes, consenting the edition
should be brought out for the profit of a French bookseller, and that
as soon as it was ready it should be sold at Paris, or wherever else it
might be thought proper, as with this I had no manner of concern.
This is exactly what was agreed upon between Madam de
Luxembourg and myself, after which I gave her my manuscript.
Madam de Luxembourg was this time accompanied by her
granddaughter Mademoiselle de Boufflers, now Duchess of Lauzun.
Her name was Amelia. She was a charming girl. She really had a
maiden beauty, mildness and timidity. Nothing could be more lovely
than her person, nothing more chaste and tender than the
sentiments she inspired. She was, besides, still a child under eleven
years of age. Madam de Luxembourg, who thought her too timid,
used every endeavor to animate her. She permitted me several
times to give her a kiss, which I did with my usual awkwardness.
Instead of saying flattering things to her, as any other person would
have done, I remained silent and disconcerted, and I know not which
of the two, the little girl or myself, was most ashamed.

I met her one day alone in the staircase of the little castle. She had
been to see Theresa, with whom her governess still was. Not
knowing what else to say, I proposed to her a kiss, which, in the
innocence of her heart, she did not refuse; having in the morning
received one from me by order of her grandmother, and in her
presence. The next day, while reading Emilius by the side of the bed
of Madam de Luxembourg, I came to a passage in which I justly
censure that which I had done the preceding evening. She thought
the reflection extremely just, and said some very sensible things
upon the subject which made me blush. How was I enraged at my

incredible stupidity, which has frequently given me the appearance of
guilt when I was nothing more than a fool and embarrassed! A
stupidity, which in a man known to be endowed with some wit, is
considered as a false excuse. I can safely swear that in this kiss, as
well as in the others, the heart and thoughts of Mademoiselle Amelia
were not more pure than my own, and that if I could have avoided
meeting her I should have done it; not that I had not great pleasure
in seeing her, but from the embarrassment of not finding a word
proper to say. Whence comes it that even a child can intimidate a
man, whom the power of kings has never inspired with fear? What is
to be done? How, without presence of mind, am I to act? If I strive to
speak to the persons I meet, I certainly say some stupid thing to
them; if I remain silent, I am a misanthrope, an unsociable animal, a
bear. Total imbecility would have been more favorable to me; but the
talents which I have failed to improve in the world have become the
instruments of my destruction, and of that of the talents I possessed.
At the latter end of this journey, Madam de Luxembourg did a
good action in which I had some share. Diderot having very
imprudently offended the Princess of Robeck, daughter of M. de
Luxembourg, Palissot, whom she protected, took up the quarrel, and
revenged her by the comedy of 'The Philosophers', in which I was
ridiculed, and Diderot very roughly handled. The author treated me
with more gentleness, less, I am of opinion, on account of the
obligation he was under to me, than from the fear of displeasing the
father of his protectress, by whom he knew I was beloved. The
bookseller Duchesne, with whom I was not at that time acquainted,
sent me the comedy when it was printed, and this I suspect was by
the order of Palissot, who, perhaps, thought I should have a pleasure
in seeing a man with whom I was no longer connected defamed. He
was greatly deceived. When I broke with Diderot, whom I thought
less ill-natured than weak and indiscreet, I still always preserved for
his person an attachment, an esteem even, and a respect for our
ancient friendship, which I know was for a long time as sincere on
his part as on mine. The case was quite different with Grimm; a man
false by nature, who never loved me, who is not even capable of
friendship, and a person who, without the least subject of complaint,
and solely to satisfy his gloomy jealousy, became, under the mask of

friendship, my most cruel calumniator. This man is to me a cipher;
the other will always be my old friend.
My very bowels yearned at the sight of this odious piece: the
reading of it was insupportable to me, and, without going through the
whole, I returned the copy to Duchesne with the following letter:
MONTMORENCY,

st, May,

.

"In casting my eyes over the piece you sent me, I trembled at
seeing myself well spoken of in it. I do not accept the horrid present.
I am persuaded that in sending it me, you did not intend an insult;
but you do not know, or have forgotten, that I have the honor to be
the friend of a respectable man, who is shamefully defamed and
calumniated in this libel."
Duchense showed the letter. Diderot, upon whom it ought to have
had an effect quite contrary, was vexed at it. His pride could not
forgive me the superiority of a generous action, and I was informed
his wife everywhere inveighed against me with a bitterness with
which I was not in the least affected, as I knew she was known to
everybody to be a noisy babbler.
Diderot in his turn found an avenger in the Abbe Morrellet, who
wrote against Palissot a little work, imitated from the 'Petit Prophete',
and entitled the Vision. In this production he very imprudently
offended Madam de Robeck, whose friends got him sent to the
Bastile; though she, not naturally vindictive, and at that time in a
dying state, I am certain had nothing to do with the affair.
D'Alembert, who was very intimately connected with Morrellet,
wrote me a letter, desiring I would beg of Madam de Luxembourg to
solicit his liberty, promising her in return encomiums in the
'Encyclopedie'; my answer to this letter was as follows:
"I did not wait the receipt of your letter before I expressed to
Madam de Luxembourg the pain the confinement of the Abbe
Morrellet gave me. She knows my concern, and shall be made
acquainted with yours, and her knowing that the abbe is a man of
merit will be sufficient to make her interest herself in his behalf.
However, although she and the marechal honor me with a
benevolence which is my greatest consolation, and that the name of

your friend be to them a recommendation in favor of the Abbe
Morrellet, I know not how far, on this occasion, it may be proper for
them to employ the credit attached to the rank they hold, and the
consideration due to their persons. I am not even convinced that the
vengeance in question relates to the Princess Robeck so much as
you seem to imagine; and were this even the case, we must not
suppose that the pleasure of vengeance belongs to philosophers
exclusively, and that when they choose to become women, women
will become philosophers.
"I will communicate to you whatever Madam de Luxembourg may
say to me after having shown her your letter. In the meantime, I think
I know her well enough to assure you that, should she have the
pleasure of contributing to the enlargement of the Abbe Morrellet,
she will not accept the tribute of acknowledgment you promise her in
the Encyclopedie, although she might think herself honored by it,
because she does not do good in the expectation of praise, but from
the dictates of her heart."
I made every effort to excite the zeal and commiseration of
Madam de Luxembourg in favor of the poor captive, and succeeded
to my wishes. She went to Versailles on purpose to speak to M. de
St. Florentin, and this journey shortened the residence at
Montmorency, which the marechal was obliged to quit at the same
time to go to Rouen, whither the king sent him as governor of
Normandy, on account of the motions of the parliament, which
government wished to keep within bounds. Madam de Luxembourg
wrote me the following letter the day after her departure:
VERSAILLES, Wednesday.
"M. de Luxembourg set off yesterday morning at six o'clock. I do
not yet know that I shall follow him. I wait until he writes to me, as he
is not yet certain of the stay it will be necessary for him to make. I
have seen M. de St. Florentin, who is as favorably disposed as
possible towards the Abbe Morrellet; but he finds some obstacles to
his wishes which however, he is in hopes of removing the first time
he has to do business with the king, which will be next week. I have
also desired as a favor that he might not be exiled, because this was

intended; he was to be sent to Nancy. This, sir, is what I have been
able to obtain; but I promise you I will not let M. de St. Florentin rest
until the affair is terminated in the manner you desire. Let me now
express to you how sorry I am on account of my being obliged to
leave you so soon, of which I flatter myself you have not the least
doubt. I love you with all my heart, and shall do so for my whole life."
A few days afterwards I received the following note from
D'Alembert, which gave me real joy.
August st.
"Thanks to your cares, my dear philosopher, the abbe has left the
Bastile, and his imprisonment will have no other consequence. He is
setting off for the country, and, as well as myself, returns you a
thousand thanks and compliments. 'Vale et me ama'."
The abbe also wrote to me a few days afterwards a letter of
thanks, which did not, in my opinion, seem to breathe a certain
effusion of the heart, and in which he seemed in some measure to
extenuate the service I had rendered him. Some time afterwards, I
found that he and D'Alembert had, to a certain degree, I will not say
supplanted, but succeeded me in the good graces of Madam de
Luxembourg, and that I Had lost in them all they had gained.
However, I am far from suspecting the Abbe Morrellet of having
contributed to my disgrace; I have too much esteem for him to
harbor any such suspicion. With respect to D'Alembert, I shall at
present leave him out of the question, and hereafter say of him what
may seem necessary.
I had, at the same time, another affair which occasioned the last
letter I wrote to Voltaire; a letter against which he vehemently
exclaimed, as an abominable insult, although he never showed it to
any person. I will here supply the want of that which he refused to
do.
The Abbe Trublet, with whom I had a slight acquaintance, but
whom I had but seldom seen, wrote to me on the th of June,
,
informing me that M. Formey, his friend and correspondent, had
printed in his journal my letter to Voltaire upon the disaster at Lisbon.
The abbe wished to know how the letter came to be printed, and in

his jesuitical manner, asked me my opinion, without giving me his
own on the necessity of reprinting it. As I most sovereignly hate this
kind of artifice and strategem, I returned such thanks as were proper,
but in a manner so reserved as to make him feel it, although this did
not prevent him from wheedling me in two or three other letters until
he had gathered all he wished to know.
I clearly understood that, not withstanding all Trublet could say,
Formey had not found the letter printed, and that the first impression
of it came from himself. I knew him to be an impudent pilferer, who,
without ceremony, made himself a revenue by the works of others.
Although he had not yet had the incredible effrontery to take from a
book already published the name of the author, to put his own in the
place of it, and to sell the book for his own profit.
[In this manner he afterwards appropriated to himself
Emilius.]

But by what means had this manuscript fallen into his hands? That
was a question not easy to resolve, but by which I had the weakness
to be embarrassed. Although Voltaire was excessively honored by
the letter, as in fact, notwithstanding his rude proceedings, he would
have had a right to complain had I had it printed without his consent,
I resolved to write to him upon the subject. The second letter was as
follows, to which he returned no answer, and giving greater scope to
his brutality, he feigned to be irritated to fury.
MONTMORENCY,

th June,

.

"I did not think, sir, I should ever have occasion to correspond with
you. But learning the letter I wrote to you in
had been printed at
Berlin, I owe you an account of my conduct in that respect, and will
fulfil this duty with truth and simplicity.
"The letter having really been addressed to you was not intended
to be printed. I communicated the contents of it, on certain
conditions, to three persons, to whom the right of friendship did not
permit me to refuse anything of the kind, and whom the same rights
still less permitted to abuse my confidence by betraying their
promise. These persons are Madam de Chenonceaux, daughter-in-

law to Madam Dupin, the Comtesse d'Houdetot, and a German of
the name of Grimm. Madam de Chenonceaux was desirous the
letter should be printed, and asked my consent. I told her that
depended upon yours. This was asked of you which you refused,
and the matter dropped.
"However, the Abbe Trublet, with whom I have not the least
connection, has just written to me from a motive of the most polite
attention that having received the papers of the journal of M. Formey,
he found in them this same letter with an advertisement, dated on
the d of October,
, in which the editor states that he had a few
weeks before found it in the shops of the booksellers of Berlin, and,
as it is one of those loose sheets which shortly disappear, he thought
proper to give it a place in his journal.
"This, sir, is all I know of the matter. It is certain the letter had not
until lately been heard of at Paris. It is also as certain that the copy,
either in manuscript or print, fallen into the hands of M. de Formey,
could never have reached them except by your means (which is not
probable) or of those of one of the three persons I have mentioned.
Finally, it is well known the two ladies are incapable of such a perfidy.
I cannot, in my retirement learn more relative to the affair. You have
a correspondence by means of which you may, if you think it worth
the trouble, go back to the source and verify the fact.
"In the same letter the Abbe' Trublet informs me that he keeps the
paper in reserve, and will not lend it without my consent, which most
assuredly I will not give. But it is possible this copy may not be the
only one in Paris. I wish, sir, the letter may not be printed there, and I
will do all in my power to prevent this from happening; but if I cannot
succeed, and that, timely perceiving it, I can have the preference, I
will not then hesitate to have it immediately printed. This to me
appears just and natural.
"With respect to your answer to the same letter, it has not been
communicated to anyone, and you may be assured it shall not be
printed without your consent, which I certainly shall not be indiscreet
enough to ask of you, well knowing that what one man writes to
another is not written to the public. But should you choose to write
one you wish to have published, and address it to me, I promise you

faithfully to add to it my letter and not to make to it a single word of
reply.
"I love you not, sir; you have done me, your disciple and
enthusiastic admirer; injuries which might have caused me the most
exquisite pain. You have ruined Geneva, in return for the asylum it
has afforded you; you have alienated from me my fellow-citizens, in
return for eulogiums I made of you amongst them; it is you who
render to me the residence of my own country insupportable; it is
you who will oblige me to die in a foreign land, deprived of all the
consolations usually administered to a dying person; and cause me,
instead of receiving funeral rites, to be thrown to the dogs, whilst all
the honors a man can expect will accompany you in my country.
Finally I hate you because you have been desirous I should but I
hate you as a man more worthy of loving you had you chosen it. Of
all the sentiments with which my heart was penetrated for you,
admiration, which cannot be refused your fine genius, and a partiality
to your writings, are those you have not effaced. If I can honor
nothing in you except your talents, the fault is not mine. I shall never
be wanting in the respect due to them, nor in that which this respect
requires."
In the midst of these little literary cavillings, which still fortified my
resolution, I received the greatest honor letters ever acquired me,
and of which I was the most sensible, in the two visits the Prince of
Conti deigned to make to me, one at the Little Castle and the other
at Mont Louis. He chose the time for both of these when M. de
Luxembourg was not at Montmorency, in order to render it more
manifest that he came there solely on my account. I have never had
a doubt of my owing the first condescensions of this prince to
Madam de Luxembourg and Madam de Boufflers; but I am of opinion
I owe to his own sentiments and to myself those with which he has
since that time continually honored me.
[Remark the perseverance of this blind and stupid
confidence in the
midst of all the treatment which should soonest have
undeceived me.
It continued until my return to Paris in
.]

My apartments at Mont Louis being small, and the situation of the
alcove charming, I conducted the prince to it, where, to complete the
condescension he was pleased to show me, he chose I should have
the honor of playing with him a game of chess. I knew he beat the
Chevalier de Lorenzy, who played better than I did. However,
notwithstanding the signs and grimace of the chevalier and the
spectators, which I feigned not to see, I won the two games we
played: When they were ended, I said to him in a respectful but very
grave manner: "My lord, I honor your serene highness too much not
to beat you always at chess." This great prince, who had real wit,
sense, and knowledge, and so was worthy not to be treated with
mean adulation, felt in fact, at least I think so, that I was the only
person present who treated him like a man, and I have every reason
to believe he was not displeased with me for it.
Had this even been the case, I should not have reproached myself
with having been unwilling to deceive him in anything, and I certainly
cannot do it with having in my heart made an ill return for his
goodness, but solely with having sometimes done it with an ill grace,
whilst he himself accompanied with infinite gracefulness the manner
in which he showed me the marks of it. A few days afterwards he
ordered a hamper of game to be sent me, which I received as I
ought. This in a little time was succeeded by another, and one of his
gamekeepers wrote me, by order of his highness, that the game it
contained had been shot by the prince himself. I received this
second hamper, but I wrote to Madam de Boufflers that I would not
receive a third. This letter was generally blamed, and deservedly so.
Refusing to accept presents of game from a prince of the blood, who
moreover sends it in so polite a manner, is less the delicacy of a
haughty man, who wishes to preserve his independence, than the
rusticity of a clown, who does not know himself. I have never read
this letter in my collection without blushing and reproaching myself
for having written it. But I have not undertaken my Confession with
an intention of concealing my faults, and that of which I have just
spoken is too shocking in my own eyes to suffer me to pass it over in
silence.
If I were not guilty of the offence of becoming his rival I was very
near doing it; for Madam de Boufflers was still his mistress, and I

knew nothing of the matter. She came rather frequently to see me
with the Chevalier de Lorenzy. She was yet young and beautiful,
affected to be whimsical, and my mind was always romantic, which
was much of the same nature. I was near being laid hold of; I believe
she perceived it; the chevalier saw it also, at least he spoke to me
upon the subject, and in a manner not discouraging. But I was this
time reasonable, and at the age of fifty it was time I should be so.
Full of the doctrine I had just preached to graybeards in my letter to
D'Alembert, I should have been ashamed of not profiting by it myself;
besides, coming to the knowledge of that of which I had been
ignorant, I must have been mad to have carried my pretensions so
far as to expose myself to such an illustrious rivalry. Finally, ill cured
perhaps of my passion for Madam de Houdetot, I felt nothing could
replace it in my heart, and I bade adieu to love for the rest of my life.
I have this moment just withstood the dangerous allurements of a
young woman who had her views; and if she feigned to forget my
twelve lustres I remember them. After having thus withdrawn myself
from danger, I am no longer afraid of a fall, and I answer for myself
for the rest of my days.
Madam de Boufflers, perceiving the emotion she caused in me,
might also observe I had triumphed over it. I am neither mad nor vain
enough to believe I was at my age capable of inspiring her with the
same feelings; but, from certain words which she let drop to
Theresa, I thought I had inspired her with a curiosity; if this be the
case, and that she has not forgiven me the disappointment she met
with, it must be confessed I was born to be the victim of my
weaknesses, since triumphant love was so prejudicial to me, and
love triumphed over not less so.
Here finishes the collection of letters which has served me as a
guide in the last two books. My steps will in future be directed by
memory only; but this is of such a nature, relative to the period to
which I am now come, and the strong impression of objects has
remained so perfectly upon my mind, that lost in the immense sea of
my misfortunes, I cannot forget the detail of my first shipwreck,
although the consequences present to me but a confused
remembrance. I therefore shall be able to proceed in the succeeding

book with sufficient confidence. If I go further it will be groping in the
dark.

Although Eloisa, which for a long time had been in the press, did not
yet, at the end of the year,
, appear, the work already began to
make a great noise. Madam de Luxembourg had spoken of it at
court, and Madam de Houdetot at Paris. The latter had obtained
from me permission for Saint Lambert to read the manuscript to the
King of Poland, who had been delighted with it. Duclos, to whom I
had also given the perusal of the work, had spoken of it at the
academy. All Paris was impatient to see the novel; the booksellers of
the Rue Saint Jacques, and that of the Palais Royal, were beset with
people who came to inquire when it was to be published. It was at
length brought out, and the success it had, answered, contrary to
custom, to the impatience with which it had been expected. The
dauphiness, who was one of the first who read it, spoke of it to, M.
de Luxembourg as a ravishing performance. The opinions of men of
letters differed from each other, but in those of any other class
approbation was general, especially with the women, who became
so intoxicated with the book and the author, that there was not one in
high life with whom I might not have succeeded had I undertaken to
do it. Of this I have such proofs as I will not commit to paper, and
which without the aid of experience, authorized my opinion. It is
singular that the book should have succeeded better in France than
in the rest of Europe, although the French, both men and women,
are severely treated in it. Contrary to my expectation it was least
successful in Switzerland, and most so in Paris. Do friendship, love
and virtue reign in this capital more than elsewhere? Certainly not;
but there reigns in it an exquisite sensibility which transports the
heart to their image, and makes us cherish in others the pure, tender

and virtuous sentiments we no longer possess. Corruption is
everywhere the same; virtue and morality no longer exist in Europe;
but if the least love of them still remains, it is in Paris that this will be
found.--[I wrote this in
.]
In the midst of so many prejudices and feigned passions, the real
sentiments of nature are not to be distinguished from others, unless
we well know to analyze the human heart. A very nice discrimination,
not to be acquired except by the education of the world, is necessary
to feel the finesses of the heart, if I dare use the expression, with
which this work abounds. I do not hesitate to place the fourth part of
it upon an equality with the Princess of Cleves; nor to assert that had
these two works been read nowhere but in the provinces, their merit
would never have been discovered. It must not, therefore, be
considered as a matter of astonishment, that the greatest success of
my work was at court. It abounds with lively but veiled touches of the
pencil, which could not but give pleasure there, because the persons
who frequent it are more accustomed than others to discover them.
A distinction must, however, be made. The work is by no means
proper for the species of men of wit who have nothing but cunning,
who possess no other kind of discernment than that which
penetrates evil, and see nothing where good only is to be found. If,
for instance, Eloisa had been published in a certain country, I am
convinced it would not have been read through by a single person,
and the work would have been stifled in its birth.
I have collected most of the letters written to me on the subject of
this publication, and deposited them, tied up together, in the hands of
Madam de Nadillac. Should this collection ever be given to the world,
very singular things will be seen, and an opposition of opinion, which
shows what it is to have to do with the public. The thing least kept in
view, and which will ever distinguish it from every other work, is the
simplicity of the subject and the continuation of the interest, which,
confined to three persons, is kept up throughout six volumes, without
episode, romantic adventure, or anything malicious either in the
persons or actions. Diderot complimented Richardson on the
prodigious variety of his portraits and the multiplicity of his persons.
In fact, Richardson has the merit of having well characterized them
all; but with respect to their number, he has that in common with the

most insipid writers of novels who attempt to make up for the sterility
of their ideas by multiplying persons and adventures. It is easy to
awaken the attention by incessantly presenting unheard of
adventures and new faces, which pass before the imagination as the
figures in a magic lanthorn do before the eye; but to keep up that
attention to the same objects, and without the aid of the wonderful, is
certainly more difficult; and if, everything else being equal, the
simplicity of the subject adds to the beauty of the work, the novels of
Richardson, superior in so many other respects, cannot in this be
compared to mine. I know it is already forgotten, and the cause of its
being so; but it will be taken up again. All my fear was that, by an
extreme simplicity, the narrative would be fatiguing, and that it was
not sufficiently interesting to engage the attention throughout the
whole. I was relieved from this apprehension by a circumstance
which alone was more flattering to my pride than all the compliments
made me upon the work.
It appeared at the beginning of the carnival; a hawker carried it to
the Princess of Talmont--[It was not the princess, but some other
lady, whose name I do not know.]--on the evening of a ball night at
the opera. After supper the Princess dressed herself for the ball, and
until the hour of going there, took up the new novel. At midnight she
ordered the horses to be put into the carriage, and continued to read.
The servant returned to tell her the horses were put to; she made no
answer. Her people perceiving she forgot herself, came to tell her it
was two o'clock. "There is yet no hurry," replied the princess, still
reading on. Some time afterwards, her watch having stopped, she
rang to know the hour. She was told it was four o'clock. "That being
the case," she said, "it is too late to go to the ball; let the horses be
taken off." She undressed herself and passed the rest of the night in
reading.
Ever since I came to the knowledge of this circumstance, I have
had a constant desire to see the lady, not only to know from herself
whether or not what I have related be exactly true, but because I
have always thought it impossible to be interested in so lively a
manner in the happiness of Julia, without having that sixth and moral
sense with which so few hearts are endowed, and without which no
person whatever can understand the sentiments of mine.

What rendered the women so favorable to me was, their being
persuaded that I had written my own history, and was myself the
hero of the romance. This opinion was so firmly established, that
Madam de Polignac wrote to Madam de Verdelin, begging she would
prevail upon me to show her the portrait of Julia. Everybody thought
it was impossible so strongly to express sentiments without having
felt them, or thus to describe the transports of love, unless
immediately from the feelings of the heart. This was true, and I
certainly wrote the novel during the time my imagination was
inflamed to ecstasy; but they who thought real objects necessary to
this effect were deceived, and far from conceiving to what a degree I
can at will produce it for imaginary beings. Without Madam
d'Houdetot, and the recollection of a few circumstances in my youth,
the amours I have felt and described would have been with fairy
nymphs. I was unwilling either to confirm or destroy an error which
was advantageous to me. The reader may see in the preface a
dialogue, which I had printed separately, in what manner I left the
public in suspense. Rigorous people say, I ought to have explicity
declared the truth. For my part I see no reason for this, nor anything
that could oblige me to it, and am of opinion there would have been
more folly than candor in the declaration without necessity.
Much about the same time the 'Paix Perpetuelle' made its
appearance, of this I had the year before given the manuscript to a
certain M. de Bastide, the author of a journal called Le Monde, into
which he would at all events cram all my manuscripts. He was
known to M. Duclos, and came in his name to beg I would help him
to fill the Monde. He had heard speak of Eloisa, and would have me
put this into his journal; he was also desirous of making the same
use of Emilius; he would have asked me for the Social Contract for
the same purpose, had he suspected it to be written. At length,
fatigued with his importunities, I resolved upon letting him have the
Paix Perpetuelle, which I gave him for twelve louis. Our agreement
was, that he should print it in his journal; but as soon as he became
the proprietor of the manuscript, he thought proper to print it
separately, with a few retrenchments, which the censor required him
to make. What would have happened had I joined to the work my
opinion of it, which fortunately I did not communicate to M. de

Bastide, nor was it comprehended in our agreement? This remains
still in manuscript amongst my papers. If ever it be made public, the
world will see how much the pleasantries and self-sufficient manner
of M. de Voltaire on the subject must have made me, who was so
well acquainted with the short-sightedness of this poor man in
political matters, of which he took it into his head to speak, shake my
sides with laughter.
In the midst of my success with the women and the public, I felt I
lost ground at the Hotel de Luxembourg, not with the marechal,
whose goodness to me seemed daily to increase, but with his lady.
Since I had had nothing more to read to her, the door of her
apartment was not so frequently open to me, and during her stay at
Montmorency, although I regularly presented myself, I seldom saw
her except at table. My place even there was not distinctly marked
out as usual. As she no longer offered me that by her side, and
spoke to me but seldom, not having on my part much to say to her, I
was well satisfied with another, where I was more at my ease,
especially in the evening; for I mechanically contracted the habit of
placing myself nearer and nearer to the marechal.
Apropos of the evening: I recollect having said I did not sup at the
castle, and this was true, at the beginning of my acquaintance there;
but as M. de Luxembourg did not dine, nor even sit down to table, it
happened that I was for several months, and already very familiar in
the family, without ever having eaten with him. This he had the
goodness to remark, upon which I determined to sup there from time
to time, when the company was not numerous; I did so, and found
the suppers very agreeable, as the dinners were taken almost
standing; whereas the former were long, everybody remaining
seated with pleasure after a long walk; and very good and
agreeable, because M. de Luxembourg loved good eating, and the
honors of them were done in a charming manner by madam de
marechale. Without this explanation it would be difficult to
understand the end of a letter from M. de Luxembourg, in which he
says he recollects our walks with the greatest pleasure; especially,
adds he, when in the evening we entered the court and did not find
there the traces of carriages. The rake being every morning drawn
over the gravel to efface the marks left by the coach wheels, I judged

by the number of ruts of that of the persons who had arrived in the
afternoon.
This year,
, completed the heavy losses this good man had
suffered since I had had the honor of being known to him. As if it had
been ordained that the evils prepared for me by destiny should begin
by the man to whom I was most attached, and who was the most
worthy of esteem. The first year he lost his sister, the Duchess of
Villeroy; the second, his daughter, the Princess of Robeck; the third,
he lost in the Duke of Montmorency his only son; and in the Comte
de Luxembourg, his grandson, the last two supporters of the branch
of which he was, and of his name. He supported all these losses with
apparent courage, but his heart incessantly bled in secret during the
rest of his life, and his health was ever after upon the decline. The
unexpected and tragical death of his son must have afflicted him the
more, as it happened immediately after the king had granted him for
his child, and given him the promise for his grandson, the reversion
of the commission he himself then held of the captain of the Gardes
de Corps. He had the mortification to see the last, a most promising
young man, perish by degrees from the blind confidence of the
mother in the physician, who giving the unhappy youth medicines for
food, suffered him to die of inanition. Alas! had my advice been
taken, the grandfather and the grandson would both still have been
alive. What did not I say and write to the marechal, what
remonstrances did I make to Madam de Montmorency, upon the
more than severe regimen, which, upon the faith of physicians, she
made her son observe! Madam de Luxembourg, who thought as I
did, would not usurp the authority of the mother; M. de Luxembourg,
a man of mild and easy character, did not like to contradict her.
Madam de Montmorency had in Borden a confidence to which her
son at length became a victim. How delighted was the poor creature
when he could obtain permission to come to Mont Louis with Madam
de Boufflers, to ask Theresa for some victuals for his famished
stomach! How did I secretly deplore the miseries of greatness in
seeing this only heir to a immense fortune, a great name, and so
many dignified titles, devour with the greediness of a beggar a
wretched morsel of bread! At length, notwithstanding all I could say
and do, the physician triumphed, and the child died of hunger.

The same confidence in quacks, which destroyed the grandson,
hastened the dissolution of the grandfather, and to this he added the
pusillanimity of wishing to dissimulate the infirmities of age. M. de
Luxembourg had at intervals a pain in the great toe; he was seized
with it at Montmorency, which deprived him of sleep, and brought on
slight fever. I had courage enough to pronounce the word gout.
Madam de Luxembourg gave me a reprimand. The surgeon, valet de
chambre of the marechal, maintained it was not the gout, and
dressed the suffering part with beaume tranquille. Unfortunately the
pain subsided, and when it returned the same remedy was had
recourse to. The constitution of the marechal was weakened, and his
disorder increased, as did his remedies in the same proportion.
Madam de Luxembourg, who at length perceived the primary
disorder to be the gout, objected to the dangerous manner of treating
it. Things were afterwards concealed from her, and M. de
Luxembourg in a few years lost his life in consequence of his
obstinate adherence to what he imagined to be a method of cure.
But let me not anticipate misfortune: how many others have I to
relate before I come to this!
It is singular with what fatality everything I could say and do
seemed of a nature to displease Madam de Luxembourg, even when
I had it most at heart to preserve her friendship. The repeated
afflictions which fell upon M. de Luxembourg still attached me to him
the more, and consequently to Madam de Luxembourg; for they
always seemed to me to be so sincerely united, that the sentiments
in favor of the one necessarily extended to the other. The marechal
grew old. His assiduity at court, the cares this brought on, continually
hunting, fatigue, and especially that of the service during the quarter
he was in waiting, required the vigor of a young man, and I did not
perceive anything that could support his in that course of life; since,
besides after his death, his dignities were to be dispersed and his
name extinct, it was by no means necessary for him to continue a
laborious life of which the principal object had been to dispose the
prince favorably to his children. One day when we three were
together, and he complained of the fatigues of the court, as a man
who had been discouraged by his losses, I took the liberty to speak
of retirement, and to give him the advice Cyneas gave to Pyrrhus.

He sighed, and returned no positive answer. But the moment Madam
de Luxembourg found me alone she reprimanded me severely for
what I had said, at which she seemed to be alarmed. She made a
remark of which I so strongly felt the justness that I determined never
again to touch upon the subject: this was, that the long habit of living
at court made that life necessary, that it was become a matter of
amusement for M. de Luxembourg, and that the retirement I
proposed to him would be less a relaxation from care than an exile,
in which inactivity, weariness and melancholy would soon put an end
to his existence. Although she must have perceived I was convinced,
and ought to have relied upon the promise I made her, and which I
faithfully kept, she still seemed to doubt of it; and I recollect that the
conversations I afterwards had with the marechal were less frequent
and almost always interrupted.
Whilst my stupidity and awkwardness injured me in her opinion,
persons whom she frequently saw and most loved, were far from
being disposed to aid me in gaining what I had lost. The Abbe de
Boufflers especially, a young man as lofty as it was possible for a
man to be, never seemed well disposed towards me; and besides
his being the only person of the society of Madam de Luxembourg
who never showed me the least attention, I thought I perceived I lost
something with her every time he came to the castle. It is true that
without his wishing this to be the case, his presence alone was
sufficient to produce the effect; so much did his graceful and elegant
manner render still more dull my stupid propositi. During the first two
years he seldom came to Montmorency, and by the indulgence of
Madam de Luxembourg I had tolerably supported myself, but as
soon as his visits began to be regular I was irretrievably lost. I
wished to take refuge under his wing, and gain his friendship; but the
same awkwardness which made it necessary I should please him
prevented me from succeeding in the attempt I made to do it, and
what I did with that intention entirely lost me with Madam de
Luxembourg, without being of the least service to me with the abbe.
With his understanding he might have succeeded in anything, but
the impossibility of applying himself, and his turn for dissipation,
prevented his acquiring a perfect knowledge of any subject. His
talents are however various, and this is sufficient for the circles in

which he wishes to distinguish himself. He writes light poetry and
fashionable letters, strums on the cithern, and pretends to draw with
crayon. He took it into his head to attempt the portrait of Madam de
Luxembourg; the sketch he produced was horrid. She said it did not
in the least resemble her and this was true. The traitorous abbe
consulted me, and I like a fool and a liar, said there was a likeness. I
wished to flatter the abbe, but I did not please the lady who noted
down what I had said, and the abbe, having obtained what he
wanted, laughed at me in his turn. I perceived by the ill success of
this my late beginning the necessity of making another attempt to
flatter 'invita Minerva'.
My talent was that of telling men useful but severe truths with
energy and courage; to this it was necessary to confine myself. Not
only I was not born to flatter, but I knew not how to commend. The
awkwardness of the manner in which I have sometimes bestowed
eulogium has done me more harm than the severity of my censure.
Of this I have to adduce one terrible instance, the consequences of
which have not only fixed my fate for the rest of my life, but will
perhaps decide on my reputation throughout all posterity.
During the residence of M. de Luxembourg at Montmorency, M. de
Choiseul sometimes came to supper at the castle. He arrived there
one day after I had left it. My name was mentioned, and M. de
Luxembourg related to him what had happened at Venice between
me and M. de Montaigu. M. de Choiseul said it was a pity I had
quitted that track, and that if I chose to enter it again he would most
willingly give me employment. M. de Luxembourg told me what had
passed. Of this I was the more sensible as I was not accustomed to
be spoiled by ministers, and had I been in a better state of health it is
not certain that I should not have been guilty of a new folly. Ambition
never had power over my mind except during the short intervals in
which every other passion left me at liberty; but one of these
intervals would have been sufficient to determine me. This good
intention of M. de Choiseul gained him my attachment and increased
the esteem which, in consequence of some operations in his
administration, I had conceived for his talents; and the family
compact in particular had appeared to me to evince a statesman of
the first order. He moreover gained ground in my estimation by the

little respect I entertained for his predecessors, not even excepting
Madam de Pompadour, whom I considered as a species of prime
minister, and when it was reported that one of these two would expel
the other, I thought I offered up prayers for the honor of France when
I wished that M. de Choiseul might triumph. I had always felt an
antipathy to Madam de Pompadour, even before her preferment; I
had seen her with Madam de la Popliniere when her name was still
Madam d'Etioles. I was afterwards dissatisfied with her silence on
the subject of Diderot, and with her proceedings relative to myself,
as well on the subject of the 'Muses Galantes', as on that of the
'Devin du Village', which had not in any manner produced me
advantages proportioned to its success; and on all occasions I had
found her but little disposed to serve me. This however did not
prevent the Chevalier de Lorenzy from proposing to me to write
something in praise of that lady, insinuating that I might acquire
some advantage by it. The proposition excited my indignation, the
more as I perceived it did not come from himself, knowing that,
passive as he was, he thought and acted according to the impulsion
he received. I am so little accustomed to constraint that it was
impossible for me to conceal from him my disdain, nor from anybody
the moderate opinion I had of the favorite; this I am sure she knew,
and thus my own interest was added to my natural inclination in the
wishes I formed for M. de Choiseul. Having a great esteem for his
talents, which was all I knew of him, full of gratitude for his kind
intentions, and moreover unacquainted in my retirement with his
taste and manner of living, I already considered him as the avenger
of the public and myself; and being at that time writing the conclusion
of my Social Contract, I stated in it, in a single passage, what I
thought of preceding ministers, and of him by whom they began to
be eclipsed. On this occasion I acted contrary to my most constant
maxim; and besides, I did not recollect that, in bestowing praise and
strongly censuring in the same article, without naming the persons,
the language must be so appropriated to those to whom it is
applicable, that the most ticklish pride cannot find in it the least thing
equivocal. I was in this respect in such an imprudent security, that I
never once thought it was possible any one should make a false
application. It will soon appear whether or not I was right.

One of my misfortunes was always to be connected with some
female author. This I thought I might avoid amongst the great. I was
deceived; it still pursued me. Madam de Luxembourg was not,
however; at least that I know of, attacked with the mania of writing;
but Madam de Boufflers was. She wrote a tragedy in prose, which, in
the first place, was read, handed about, and highly spoken of in the
society of the Prince Conti, and upon which, not satisfied with the
encomiums she received, she would absolutely consult me for the
purpose of having mine. This she obtained, but with that moderation
which the work deserved. She besides had with it the information I
thought it my duty to give her, that her piece, entitled 'L'Esclave
Genereux', greatly resembled the English tragedy of 'Oroonoko', but
little known in France, although translated into the French language.
Madam de Bouffiers thanked me for the remark, but, however,
assured me there was not the least resemblance between her piece
and the other. I never spoke of the plagiarisms except to herself, and
I did it to discharge a duty she had imposed on me; but this has not
since prevented me from frequently recollecting the consequences of
the sincerity of Gil Blas to the preaching archbishop.
Besides the Abbe de Bouffiers, by whom I was not beloved, and
Madam de Bouffiers, in whose opinion I was guilty of that which
neither women nor authors ever pardon, the other friends of Madam
de Luxembourg never seemed much disposed to become mine,
particularly the President Henault, who, enrolled amongst authors,
was not exempt from their weaknesses; also Madam du Deffand,
and Mademoiselle de Lespinasse, both intimate with Voltaire and the
friends of D'Alembert, with whom the latter at length lived, however
upon an honorable footing, for it cannot be understood I mean
otherwise. I first began to interest myself for Madam du Deffand,
whom the loss of her eyes made an object of commiseration in mine;
but her manner of living so contrary to my own, that her hour of
going to bed was almost mine for rising; her unbounded passion for
low wit, the importance she gave to every kind of printed trash, either
complimentary or abusive, the despotism and transports of her
oracles, her excessive admiration or dislike of everything, which did
not permit her to speak upon any subject without convulsions, her
inconceivable prejudices, invincible obstinacy, and the enthusiasm of

folly to which this carried her in her passionate judgments; all
disgusted me and diminished the attention I wished to pay her. I
neglected her and she perceived it; this was enough to set her in a
rage, and, although I was sufficiently aware how much a woman of
her character was to be feared, I preferred exposing myself to the
scourge of her hatred rather than to that of her friendship.
My having so few friends in the society of Madam de Luxembourg
would not have been in the least dangerous had I had no enemies in
the family. Of these I had but one, who, in my then situation, was as
powerful as a hundred. It certainly was not M. de Villeroy, her
brother; for he not only came to see me, but had several times
invited me to Villeroy; and as I had answered to the invitation with all
possible politeness and respect, he had taken my vague manner of
doing it as a consent, and arranged with Madam de Luxembourg a
journey of a fortnight, in which it was proposed to me to make one of
the party. As the cares my health then required did not permit me to
go from home without risk, I prayed Madam de Luxembourg to have
the goodness to make my apologies. Her answer proves this was
done with all possible ease, and M. de Villeroy still continued to
show me his usual marks of goodness. His nephew and heir, the
young Marquis of Villeroy, had not for me the same benevolence, nor
had I for him the respect I had for his uncle. His harebrained manner
rendered him insupportable to me, and my coldness drew upon me
his aversion. He insultingly attacked me one evening at table, and I
had the worst of it because I am a fool, without presence of mind;
and because anger, instead of rendering my wit more poignant,
deprives me of the little I have. I had a dog which had been given me
when he was quite young, soon after my arrival at the Hermitage,
and which I had called Duke. This dog, not handsome, but rare of his
kind, of which I had made my companion and friend, a title which he
certainly merited much more than most of the persons by whom it
was taken, became in great request at the castle of Montmorency for
his good nature and fondness, and the attachment we had for each
other; but from a foolish pusillanimity I had changed his name to
Turk, as if there were not many dogs called Marquis, without giving
the least offence to any marquis whatsoever. The Marquis of Villeroy,
who knew of the change of name, attacked me in such a manner

that I was obliged openly at table to relate what I had done.
Whatever there might be offensive in the name of duke, it was not in
my having given but in my having taken it away. The worst of it all
was, there were many dukes present, amongst others M. de
Luxembourg and his son; and the Marquis de Villeroy, who was one
day to have, and now has the title, enjoyed in the most cruel manner
the embarrassment into which he had thrown me. I was told the next
day his aunt had severely reprimanded him, and it may be judged
whether or not, supposing her to have been serious, this put me
upon better terms with him.
To enable me to support his enmity I had no person, neither at the
Hotel de Luxembourg nor at the Temple, except the Chevalier de
Lorenzy, who professed himself my friend; but he was more that of
D'Alembert, under whose protection he passed with women for a
great geometrician. He was more, over the cicisbe, or rather the
complaisant chevalier of the Countess of Boufflers, a great friend
also to D'Alembert, and the Chevalier de Lorenzy was the most
passive instrument in her hands. Thus, far from having in that circle
any counter-balance to my inaptitude, to keep me in the good graces
of Madam de Luxembourg, everybody who approached her seemed
to concur in injuring me in her good opinion. Yet, besides Emilius,
with which she charged herself, she gave me at the same time
another mark of her benevolence, which made me imagine that,
although wearied with my conversation, she would still preserve for
me the friendship she had so many times promised me for life.
As soon as I thought I could depend upon this, I began to ease my
heart, by confessing to her all my faults, having made it an inviolable
maxim to show myself to my friends such as I really was, neither
better nor worse. I had declared to her my connection with Theresa,
and everything that had resulted from it, without concealing the
manner in which I had disposed of my children. She had received my
confessions favorably, and even too much so, since she spared me
the censures I so much merited; and what made the greatest
impression upon me was her goodness to Theresa, making her
presents, sending for her, and begging her to come and see her,
receiving her with caresses, and often embracing her in public. This
poor girl was in transports of joy and gratitude, of which I certainly

partook; the friendship Madam de Luxembourg showed me in her
condescensions to Theresa affected me much more than if they had
been made immediately to myself.
Things remained in this state for a considerable time; but at length
Madam de Luxembourg carried her goodness so far as to have a
desire to take one of my children from the hospital. She knew I had
put a cipher into the swaddling clothes of the eldest; she asked me
for the counterpart of the cipher, and I gave it to her. In this research
she employed La Roche, her valet de chambre and confidential
servant, who made vain inquiries, although after only about twelve or
fourteen years, had the registers of the foundling hospital been in
order, or the search properly made, the original cipher ought to have
been found. However this may be, I was less sorry for his want of
success than I should have been had I from time to time continued to
see the child from its birth until that moment. If by the aid of the
indications given, another child had been presented as my own, the
doubt of its being so in fact, and the fear of having one thus
substituted for it, would have contracted my affections, and I should
not have tasted of the charm of the real sentiment of nature. This
during infancy stands in need of being supported by habit. The long
absence of a child whom the father has seen but for an instant,
weakens, and at length annihilates paternal sentiment, and parents
will never love a child sent to nurse, like that which is brought up
under their eyes. This reflection may extenuate my faults in their
effects, but it must aggravate them in their source.
It may not perhaps be useless to remark that by the means of
Theresa, the same La Roche became acquainted with Madam le
Vasseur, whom Grimm still kept at Deuil, near La Chevrette, and not
far from Montmorency.
After my departure it was by means of La Roche that I continued
to send this woman the money I had constantly sent her at stated
times, and I am of opinion he often carried her presents from Madam
de Luxembourg; therefore she certainly was not to be pitied,
although she constantly complained. With respect to Grimm, as I am
not fond of speaking of persons whom I ought to hate, I never
mentioned his name to Madam de Luxembourg, except when I could
not avoid it; but she frequently made him the subject of conversation,

without telling me what she thought of the man, or letting me
discover whether or not he was of her acquaintance. Reserve with
people I love and who are open with me being contrary to my nature,
especially in things relating to themselves, I have since that time
frequently thought of that of Madam de Luxembourg; but never,
except when other events rendered the recollection natural.
Having waited a long time without hearing speak of Emilius, after I
had given it to Madam de Luxembourg, I at last heard the agreement
was made at Paris, with the bookseller Duchesne, and by him with
Neaulme, of Amsterdam. Madam de Luxembourg sent me the
original and the duplicate of my agreement with Duchesne, that I
might sign them. I discovered the writing to be by the same hand as
that of the letters of M. de Malesherbes, which he himself did not
write. The certainty that my agreement was made by the consent,
and under the eye of that magistrate, made me sign without
hesitation. Duchesne gave me for the manuscript six thousand
livres(two hundred and fifty pounds), half in specie, and one or two
hundred copies. After having signed the two parts, I sent them both
to Madam de Luxembourg, according to her desire; she gave one to
Duchesne, and instead of returning the other kept it herself, so that I
never saw it afterwards.
My acquaintance with M. and Madam de Luxembourg, though it
diverted me a little from my plan of retirement, did not make me
entirely renounce it. Even at the time I was most in favor with Madam
de Luxembourg, I always felt that nothing but my sincere attachment
to the marechal and herself could render to me supportable the
people with whom they were connected, and all the difficulty I had
was in conciliating this attachment with a manner of life more
agreeable to my inclination, and less contrary to my health, which
constraint and late suppers continually deranged, notwithstanding all
the care taken to prevent it; for in this, as in everything else, attention
was carried as far as possible; thus, for instance, every evening after
supper the marechal, who went early to bed, never failed,
notwithstanding everything that could be said to the contrary, to
make me withdraw at the same time. It was not until some little time
before my catastrophe that, for what reason I know not, he ceased to
pay me that attention. Before I perceived the coolness of Madam de

Luxembourg, I was desirous, that I might not expose myself to it, to
execute my old project; but not having the means to that effect, I was
obliged to wait for the conclusion of the agreement for 'Emilius', and
in the time I finished the 'Social Contract', and sent it to Rey, fixing
the price of the manuscript at a thousand livres (forty-one pounds),
which he paid me.
I ought not perhaps to omit a trifling circumstance relative to this
manuscript. I gave it, well sealed up, to Du Voisin, a minister in the
pays de Vaud and chaplain at the Hotel de Hollande, who sometimes
came to see me, and took upon himself to send the packet to Rey,
with whom he was connected. The manuscript, written in a small
letter, was but very trifling, and did not fill his pocket. Yet, in passing
the barriere, the packet fell, I know not by what means, into the
hands of the Commis, who opened and examined it, and afterwards
returned it to him, when he had reclaimed it in the name of the
ambassador. This gave him an opportunity of reading it himself,
which he ingeniously wrote me he had done, speaking highly of the
work, without suffering a word of criticism or censure to escape him;
undoubtedly reserving to himself to become the avenger of
Christianity as soon as the work should appear. He resealed the
packet and sent it to Rey. Such is the substance of his narrative in
the letter in which he gave an account of the affair, and is all I ever
knew of the matter.
Besides these two books and my dictionary of music, at which I
still did something as opportunity offered, I had other works of less
importance ready to make their appearance, and which I proposed to
publish either separately or in my general collection, should I ever
undertake it. The principal of these works, most of which are still in
manuscript in the hands of De Peyrou, was an essay on the origin of
Languages, which I had read to M. de Malesherbes and the
Chevalier de Lorenzy, who spoke favorably of it. I expected all the
productions together would produce me a net capital of from eight to
ten thousand livres (three to four hundred pounds), which I intended
to sink in annuities for my life and that of Theresa; after which, our
design, as I have already mentioned, was to go and live together in
the midst of some province, without further troubling the public about
me, or myself with any other project than that of peacefully ending

my days and still continuing to do in my neighborhood all the good in
my power, and to write at leisure the memoirs which I intended.
Such was my intention, and the execution of it was facilitated by
an act of generosity in Rey, upon which I cannot be silent. This
bookseller, of whom so many unfavorable things were told me in
Paris, is, notwithstanding, the only one with whom I have always had
reason to be satisfied. It is true, we frequently disagreed as to the
execution of my works. He was heedless and I was choleric; but in
matters of interest which related to them, although I never made with
him an agreement in form, I always found in him great exactness
and probity. He is also the only person of his profession who frankly
confessed to me he gained largely by my means; and he frequently,
when he offered me a part of his fortune, told me I was the author of
it all. Not finding the means of exercising his gratitude immediately
upon myself, he wished at least to give me proofs of it in the person
of my governante, upon whom he settled an annuity of three
hundred livres (twelve pounds), expressing in the deed that it was an
acknowledgment for the advantages I had procured him. This he did
between himself and me, without ostentation, pretension, or noise,
and had not I spoken of it to anybody, not a single person would ever
have known anything of the matter. I was so pleased with this action
that I became attached to Rey, and conceived for him a real
friendship. Sometime afterwards he desired I would become
godfather to one of his children; I consented, and a part of my regret
in the situation to which I am reduced, is my being deprived of the
means of rendering in future my attachment of my goddaughter
useful to her and her parents. Why am I, who am so sensible of the
modest generosity of this bookseller, so little so of the noisy
eagerness of many persons of the highest rank, who pompously fill
the world with accounts of the services they say they wished to
render me, but the good effects of which I never felt? Is it their fault
or mine? Are they nothing more than vain; is my insensibility purely
ingratitude? Intelligent reader weigh and determine; for my part I say
no more.
This pension was a great resource to Theresa and considerable
alleviation to me, although I was far from receiving from it a direct
advantage, any more than from the presents that were made her.

She herself has always disposed of everything. When I kept her
money I gave her a faithful account of it, without ever applying any
part of the deposit to our common expenses, not even when she was
richer than myself. "What is mine is ours," said I to her; "and what is
thine is thine." I never departed from this maxim. They who have had
the baseness to accuse me of receiving by her hands that which I
refused to take with mine, undoubtedly judged of my heart by their
own, and knew but little of me. I would willingly eat with her the
bread she should have earned, but not that she should have had
given her. For a proof of this I appeal to herself, both now and
hereafter, when, according to the course of nature, she shall have
survived me. Unfortunately, she understands but little of economy in
any respect, and is, besides, careless and extravagant, not from
vanity nor gluttony, but solely from negligence. No creature is perfect
here below, and since the excellent qualities must be accompanied
with some detects; I prefer these to vices; although her defects are
more prejudicial to us both. The efforts I have made, as formerly I did
for mamma, to accumulate something in advance which might some
day be to her a never-failing resource, are not to be conceived; but
my cares were always ineffectual.
Neither of these women ever called themselves to an account,
and, notwithstanding all my efforts, everything I acquired was
dissipated as fast as it came. Notwithstanding the great simplicity of
Theresa's dress, the pension from Rey has never been sufficient to
buy her clothes, and I have every year been under the necessity of
adding something to it for that purpose. We are neither of us born to
be rich, and this I certainly do not reckon amongst our misfortunes.
The 'Social Contract' was soon printed. This was not the case with
'Emilius', for the publication of which I waited to go into the
retirement I meditated. Duchesne, from time to time, sent me
specimens of impression to choose from; when I had made my
choice, instead of beginning he sent me others. When, at length, we
were fully determined on the size and letter, and several sheets were
already printed off, on some trifling alteration I made in a proof, he
began the whole again; and at the end of six months we were in less
forwardness than on the first day. During all these experiments I
clearly perceived the work was printing in France as well as in

Holland, and that two editions of it were preparing at the same time.
What could I do? The manuscript was no longer mine. Far from
having anything to do with the edition in France, I was always
against it; but since, at length, this was preparing in spite of all
opposition, and was to serve as a model to the other, it was
necessary I should cast my eyes over it and examine the proofs, that
my work might not be mutilated. It was, besides, printed so much by
the consent of the magistrate, that it was he who, in some measure,
directed the undertaking; he likewise wrote to me frequently, and
once came to see me and converse on the subject upon an occasion
of which I am going to speak.
Whilst Duchesne crept like a snail, Neaulme, whom he withheld,
scarcely moved at all. The sheets were not regularly sent him as
they were printed. He thought there was some trick in the
manoeuvre of Duchesne, that is, of Guy who acted for him; and
perceiving the terms of the agreement to be departed from, he wrote
me letter after letter full of complaints, and it was less possible for
me to remove the subject of them than that of those I myself had to
make. His friend Guerin, who at that time came frequently to see my
house, never ceased speaking to me about the work, but always with
the greatest reserve. He knew and he did not know that it was
printing in France, and that the magistrate had a hand in it. In
expressing his concern for my embarrassment, he seemed to
accuse me of imprudence without ever saying in what this consisted;
he incessantly equivocated, and seemed to speak for no other
purpose than to hear what I had to say. I thought myself so secure
that I laughed at his mystery and circumspection as at a habit he had
contracted with ministers and magistrates whose offices he much
frequented. Certain of having conformed to every rule with the work,
and strongly persuaded that I had not only the consent and
protection of the magistrate, but that the book merited and had
obtained the favor of the minister, I congratulated myself upon my
courage in doing good, and laughed at my pusillanimous friends who
seemed uneasy on my account. Duclos was one of these, and I
confess my confidence in his understanding and uprightness might
have alarmed me, had I had less in the utility of the work and in the
probity of those by whom it was patronized. He came from the house

of M. Baille to see me whilst 'Emilius' was in the press; he spoke to
me concerning it; I read to him the 'Profession of Faith of the
Savoyard Vicar', to which he listened attentively and, as it seemed to
me with pleasure. When I had finished he said: "What! citizen, this is
a part of a work now printing in Paris?"--"Yes," answered I, and it
ought to be printed at the Louvre by order of the king."--I confess it,"
replied he; "but pray do not mention to anybody your having read to
me this fragment."
This striking manner of expressing himself surprised without
alarming me. I knew Duclos was intimate with M. de Malesherbes,
and I could not conceive how it was possible he should think so
differently from him upon the same subject.
I had lived at Montmorency for the last four years without ever
having had there one day of good health. Although the air is
excellent, the water is bad, and this may possibly be one of the
causes which contributed to increase my habitual complaints.
Towards the end of the autumn of
, I fell quite ill, and passed the
whole winter in suffering almost without intermission. The physical ill,
augmented by a thousand inquietudes, rendered these terrible. For
some time past my mind had been disturbed by melancholy
forebodings without my knowing to what these directly tended. I
received anonymous letters of an extraordinary nature, and others,
that were signed, much of the same import. I received one from a
counsellor of the parliament of Paris, who, dissatisfied with the
present constitution of things, and foreseeing nothing but
disagreeable events, consulted me upon the choice of an asylum at
Geneva or in Switzerland, to retire to with his family. An other was
brought me from M. de -----, 'president a mortier' of the parliament of
-----, who proposed to me to draw up for this Parliament, which was
then at variance with the court, memoirs and remonstrances, and
offering to furnish me with all the documents and materials
necessary for that purpose.
When I suffer I am subject to ill humor. This was the case when I
received these letters, and my answers to them, in which I flatly
refused everything that was asked of me, bore strong marks of the
effect they had had upon my mind. I do not however reproach myself
with this refusal, as the letters might be so many snares laid by my

enemies, and what was required of me was contrary to the principles
from which I was less willing than ever to swerve. But having it within
my power to refuse with politeness I did it with rudeness, and in this
consists my error.
[I knew, for instance, the President de ----- to be connected
with
the Encyclopedists and the Holbachiens]
The two letters of which I have just spoken will be found amongst
my papers. The letter from the chancellor did not absolutely surprise
me, because I agreed with him in opinion, and with many others, that
the declining constitution of France threatened an approaching
destruction. The disasters of an unsuccessful war, all of which
proceeded from a fault in the government; the incredible confusion in
the finances; the perpetual drawings upon the treasury by the
administration, which was then divided between two or three
ministers, amongst whom reigned nothing but discord, and who, to
counteract the operations of each other, let the kingdom go to ruin;
the discontent of the people, and of every other rank of subjects; the
obstinacy of a woman who, constantly sacrificing her judgment, if
she indeed possessed any, to her inclinations, kept from public
employment persons capable of discharging the duties of them, to
place in them such as pleased her best; everything occurred in
justifying the foresight of the counsellor, that of the public, and my
own. This, made me several times consider whether or not I myself
should seek an asylum out of the kingdom before it was torn by the
dissensions by which it seemed to be threatened; but relieved from
my fears by my insignificance, and the peacefulness of my
disposition, I thought that in the state of solitude in which I was
determined to live, no public commotion could reach me. I was sorry
only that, in this state of things, M. de Luxembourg should accept
commissions which tended to injure him in the opinion of the persons
of the place of which he was governor. I could have wished he had
prepared himself a retreat there, in case the great machine had
fallen in pieces, which seemed much to be apprehended; and still
appears to me beyond a doubt, that if the reins of government had

not fallen into a single hand, the French monarchy would now be at
the last gasp.
Whilst my situation became worse the printing of 'Emilius' went on
more slowly, and was at length suspended without my being able to
learn the reason why; Guy did not deign to answer my letter of
inquiry, and I could obtain no information from any person of what
was going forward. M. de Malesherbes being then in the country. A
misfortune never makes me uneasy provided I know in what it
consists; but it is my nature to be afraid of darkness, I tremble at the
appearance of it; mystery always gives me inquietude, it is too
opposite to my natural disposition, in which there is an openness
bordering on imprudence. The sight of the most hideous monster
would, I am of opinion, alarm me but little; but if by night I were to
see a figure in a white sheet I should be afraid of it. My imagination,
wrought upon by this long silence, was now employed in creating
phantoms. I tormented myself the more in endeavoring to discover
the impediment to the printing of my last and best production, as I
had the publication of it much at heart; and as I always carried
everything to an extreme, I imagined that I perceived in the
suspension the suppression of the work. Yet, being unable to
discover either the cause or manner of it, I remained in the most
cruel state of suspense. I wrote letter after letter to Guy, to M. de
Malesherbes and to Madam de Luxembourg, and not receiving
answers, at least when I expected them, my head became so
affected that I was not far from a delirium. I unfortunately heard that
Father Griffet, a Jesuit, had spoken of 'Emilius' and repeated from it
some passages. My imagination instantly unveiled to me the mystery
of iniquity; I saw the whole progress of it as clearly as if it had been
revealed to me. I figured to myself that the Jesuits, furious on
account of the contemptuous manner in which I had spoken of
colleges, were in possession of my work; that it was they who had
delayed the publication; that, informed by their friend Guerin of my
situation, and foreseeing my approaching dissolution, of which I
myself had no manner of doubt, they wished to delay the
appearance of the work until after that event, with an intention to
curtail and mutilate it, and in favor of their own views, to attribute to
me sentiments not my own. The number of facts and circumstances

which occurred to my mind, in confirmation of this silly proposition,
and gave it an appearance of truth supported by evidence and
demonstration, is astonishing. I knew Guerin to be entirely in the
interest of the Jesuits. I attributed to them all the friendly advances
he had made me; I was persuaded he had, by their entreaties,
pressed me to engage with Neaulme, who had given them the first
sheets of my work; that they had afterwards found means to stop the
printing of it by Duchesne, and perhaps to get possession of the
manuscript to make such alterations in it as they should think proper,
that after my death they might publish it disguised in their own
manner. I had always perceived, notwithstanding the wheedling of
Father Berthier, that the Jesuits did not like me, not only as an
Encyclopedist, but because all my principles were more in opposition
to their maxims and influence than the incredulity of my colleagues,
since atheistical and devout fanaticism, approaching each other by
their common enmity to toleration, may become united; a proof of
which is seen in China, and in the cabal against myself; whereas
religion, both reasonable and moral, taking away all power over the
conscience, deprives those who assume that power of every
resource. I knew the chancellor was a great friend to the Jesuits, and
I had my fears less the son, intimidated by the father, should find
himself under the necessity of abandoning the work he had
protected. I besides imagined that I perceived this to be the case in
the chicanery employed against me relative to the first two volumes,
in which alterations were required for reasons of which I could not
feel the force; whilst the other two volumes were known to contain
things of such a nature as, had the censor objected to them in the
manner he did to the passages he thought exceptionable in the
others, would have required their being entirely written over again. I
also understood, and M. de Malesherbes himself told me of it, that
the Abbe de Grave, whom he had charged with the inspection of this
edition, was another partisan of the Jesuits. I saw nothing but
Jesuits, without considering that, upon the point of being
suppressed, and wholly taken up in making their defence, they had
something which interested them much more than the cavillings
relative to a work in which they were not in question. I am wrong,
however, in saying this did not occur to me; for I really thought of it,

and M. de Malesherbes took care to make the observation to me the
moment he heard of my extravagant suspicions. But by another of
those absurdities of a man, who, from the bosom of obscurity, will
absolutely judge of the secret of great affairs, with which he is totally
unacquainted. I never could bring myself to believe the Jesuits were
in danger, and I considered the rumor of their suppression as an
artful manoeuvre of their own to deceive their adversaries. Their past
successes, which had been uninterrupted, gave me so terrible an
idea of the power, that I already was grieved at the overthrow of the
parliament. I knew M. de Choiseul had prosecuted his studies under
the Jesuits, that Madam de Pompadour was not upon bad terms with
them, and that their league with favorites and ministers had
constantly appeared advantageous to their order against their
common enemies. The court seemed to remain neuter, and
persuaded as I was that should the society receive a severe check it
would not come from the parliament, I saw in the inaction of
government the ground of their confidence and the omen of their
triumph.
In fine, perceiving in the rumors of the day nothing more than art
and dissimulation on their part, and thinking they, in their state of
security, had time to watch over all their interests, I had had not the
least doubt of their shortly crushing Jansenism, the parliament and
the Encyclopedists, with every other association which should not
submit to their yoke; and that if they ever suffered my work to
appear, this would not happen until it should be so transformed as to
favor their pretensions, and thus make use of my name the better to
deceive my readers.
I felt my health and strength decline; and such was the horror with
which my mind was filled, at the idea of dishonor to my memory in
the work most worthy of myself, that I am surprised so many
extravagant ideas did not occasion a speedy end to my existence. I
never was so much afraid of death as at this time, and had I died
with the apprehensions I then had upon my mind, I should have died
in despair. At present, although I perceived no obstacle to the
execution of the blackest and most dreadful conspiracy ever formed
against the memory of a man, I shall die much more in peace,

certain of leaving in my writings a testimony in my favor, and one
which, sooner or later, will triumph over the calumnies of mankind.
M. de Malesherbes, who discovered the agitation of my mind, and
to whom I acknowledged it, used such endeavors to restore me to
tranquility as proved his excessive goodness of heart. Madam de
Luxembourg aided him in his good work, and several times went to
Duchesne to know in what state the edition was. At length the
impression was again begun, and the progress of it became more
rapid than ever, without my knowing for what reason it had been
suspended. M. de Malesherbes took the trouble to come to
Montmorency to calm my mind; in this he succeeded, and the full
confidence I had in his uprightness having overcome the
derangement of my poor head, gave efficacy to the endeavors he
made to restore it. After what he had seen of my anguish and
delirium, it was natural he should think I was to be pitied; and he
really commiserated my situation. The expressions, incessantly
repeated, of the philosophical cabal by which he was surrounded,
occurred to his memory. When I went to live at the Hermitage, they,
as I have already remarked, said I should not remain there long.
When they saw I persevered, they charged me with obstinacy and
pride, proceeding from a want of courage to retract, and insisted that
my life was there a burden to me; in short, that I was very wretched.
M. de Malesherbes believed this really to be the case, and wrote to
me upon the subject. This error in a man for whom I had so much
esteem gave me some pain, and I wrote to him four letters
successively, in which I stated the real motives of my conduct, and
made him fully acquainted with my taste, inclination and character,
and with the most interior sentiments of my heart. These letters,
written hastily, almost without taking pen from paper, and which I
neither copied, corrected, nor even read, are perhaps the only things
I ever wrote with facility, which, in the midst of my sufferings, was, I
think, astonishing. I sighed, as I felt myself declining, at the thought
of leaving in the midst of honest men an opinion of me so far from
truth; and by the sketch hastily given in my four letters, I endeavored,
in some measure, to substitute them to the memoirs I had proposed
to write. They are expressive of my grief to M. de Malesherbes, who
showed them in Paris, and are, besides, a kind of summary of what I

here give in detail, and, on this account, merit preservation. The
copy I begged of them some years afterwards will be found amongst
my papers.
The only thing which continued to give me pain, in the idea of my
approaching dissolution, was my not having a man of letters for a
friend, to whom I could confide my papers, that after my death he
might take a proper choice of such as were worthy of publication.
After my journey to Geneva, I conceived a friendship for Moulton;
this young man pleased me, and I could have wished him to receive
my last breath. I expressed to him this desire, and am of opinion he
would readily have complied with it, had not his affairs prevented him
from so doing. Deprived of this consolation, I still wished to give him
a mark of my confidence by sending him the 'Profession of Faith of
the Savoyard Vicar' before it was published. He was pleased with the
work, but did not in his answer seem so fully to expect from it the
effect of which I had but little doubt. He wished to receive from me
some fragment which I had not given to anybody else. I sent him the
funeral oration of the late Duke of Orleans; this I had written for the
Abbe Darty, who had not pronounced it, because, contrary to his
expectation, another person was appointed to perform that
ceremony.
The printing of Emilius, after having been again taken in hand, was
continued and completed without much difficulty; and I remarked this
singularity, that after the curtailings so much insisted upon in the first
two volumes, the last two were passed over without an objection,
and their contents did not delay the publication for a moment. I had,
however, some uneasiness which I must not pass over in silence.
After having been afraid of the Jesuits, I begun to fear the Jansenists
and philosophers. An enemy to party, faction and cabal, I never
heard the least good of parties concerned in them. The gossips had
quitted their old abode and taken up their residence by the side of
me, so that in their chamber, everything said in mine, and upon the
terrace, was distinctly heard; and from their garden it would have
been easy to scale the low wall by which it was separated from my
alcove. This was become my study; my table was covered with
proofsheets of Emilius and the Social Contract and stitching these
sheets as they were sent to me, I had all my volumes a long time

before they were published. My negligence and the confidence I had
in M. Mathas, in whose garden I was shut up, frequently made me
forget to lock the door at night, and in the morning I several times
found it wide open; this, however, would not have given me the least
inquietude had I not thought my papers seemed to have been
deranged. After having several times made the same remark, I
became more careful, and locked the door. The lock was a bad one,
and the key turned in it no more than half round. As I became more
attentive, I found my papers in a much greater confusion than they
were when I left everything open. At length I missed one of my
volumes without knowing what was become of it until the morning of
the third day, when I again found it upon the table. I never suspected
either M. Mathas or his nephew M. du Moulin, knowing myself to be
beloved by both, and my confidence in them was unbounded. That I
had in the gossips began to diminish. Although they were
Jansenists, I knew them to have some connection with D' Alembert,
and moreover they all three lodged in the same house. This gave me
some uneasiness, and put me more upon my guard. I removed my
papers from the alcove to my chamber, and dropped my
acquaintance with these people, having learned they had shown in
several houses the first volume of 'Emilius', which I had been
imprudent enough to lend them. Although they continued until my
departure to be my neighbors I never, after my first suspicions, had
the least communication with them. The 'Social Contract' appeared a
month or two before 'Emilius'. Rey, whom I had desired never
secretly to introduce into France any of my books, applied to the
magistrate for leave to send this book by Rouen, to which place he
sent his package by sea. He received no answer, and his bales, after
remaining at Rouen several months, were returned to him, but not
until an attempt had been made to confiscate them; this, probably,
would have been done had not he made a great clamor. Several
persons, whose curiosity the work had excited, sent to Amsterdam
for copies, which were circulated without being much noticed.
Maulion, who had heard of this, and had, I believe, seen the work,
spoke to me on the subject with an air of mystery which surprised
me, and would likewise have made me uneasy if, certain of having
conformed to every rule, I had not by virtue of my grand maxim, kept

my mind calm. I moreover had no doubt but M. de Choiseul, already
well disposed towards me, and sensible of the eulogium of his
administration, which my esteem for him had induced me to make in
the work, would support me against the malevolence of Madam de
Pompadour.
I certainly had then as much reason as ever to hope for the
goodness of M. de Luxembourg, and even for his assistance in case
of need; for he never at any time had given me more frequent and
more pointed marks of his friendship. At the journey of Easter, my
melancholy state no longer permitting me to go to the castle, he
never suffered a day to pass without coming to see me, and at
length, perceiving my sufferings to be incessant, he prevailed upon
me to determine to see Friar Come. He immediately sent for him,
came with him, and had the courage, uncommon to a man of his
rank, to remain with me during the operation which was cruel and
tedious. Upon the first examination, Come thought he found a great
stone, and told me so; at the second, he could not find it again. After
having made a third attempt with so much care and circumspection
that I thought the time long, he declared there was no stone, but that
the prostate gland was schirrous and considerably thickened. He
besides added, that I had a great deal to suffer, and should live a
long time. Should the second prediction be as fully accomplished as
the first, my sufferings are far from being at an end.
It was thus I learned after having been so many years treated for
disorders which I never had, that my incurable disease, without
being mortal, would last as long as myself. My imagination,
repressed by this information, no longer presented to me in
prospective a cruel death in the agonies of the stone.
Delivered from imaginary evils, more cruel to me than those which
were real, I more patiently suffered the latter. It is certain I have since
suffered less from my disorder than I had done before, and every
time I recollect that I owe this alleviation to M. de Luxembourg, his
memory becomes more dear to me.
Restored, as I may say, to life, and more than ever occupied with
the plan according to which I was determined to pass the rest of my
days, all the obstacle to the immediate execution of my design was
the publication of 'Emilius'. I thought of Touraine where I had already

been and which pleased me much, as well on account of the
mildness of the climate, as on that of the character of the inhabitants.
'La terra molle lieta a dilettosa
Simile a se l'habitator produce.'
I had already spoken of my project to M. de Luxembourg, who
endeavored to dissuade me from it; I mentioned it to him a second
time as a thing resolved upon. He then offered me the castle of
Merlon, fifteen leagues from Paris, as an asylum which might be
agreeable to me, and where he and Madam de Luxembourg would
have a real pleasure in seeing me settled. The proposition made a
pleasing impression on my mind. But the first thing necessary was to
see the place, and we agreed upon a day when the marechal was to
send his valet de chambre with a carriage to take me to it. On the
day appointed, I was much indisposed; the journey was postponed,
and different circumstances prevented me from ever making it. I
have since learned the estate of Merlou did not belong to the
marechal but to his lady, on which account I was the less sorry I had
not gone to live there.
'Emilius' was at length given to the public, without my having heard
further of retrenchments or difficulties. Previous to the publication,
the marechal asked me for all the letters M. de Malesherbes had
written to me on the subject of the work. My great confidence in both,
and the perfect security in which I felt myself, prevented me from
reflecting upon this extraordinary and even alarming request. I
returned all the letters excepting one or two which, from inattention,
were left between the leaves of a book. A little time before this, M. de
Malesherbes told me he should withdraw the letters I had written to
Duchesne during my alarm relative to the Jesuits, and, it must be
confessed, these letters did no great honor to my reason. But in my
answer I assured him I would not in anything pass for being better
than I was, and that he might leave the letters where they were. I
know not what he resolved upon.
The publication of this work was not succeeded by the applause
which had followed that of all my other writings. No work was ever
more highly spoken of in private, nor had any literary production ever

had less public approbation. What was said and written to me upon
the subject by persons most capable of judging, confirmed me in my
opinion that it was the best, as well as the most important of all the
works I had produced. But everything favorable was said with an air
of the most extraordinary mystery, as if there had been a necessity
of keeping it a secret. Madam de Boufflers, who wrote to me that the
author of the work merited a statue, and the homage of mankind, at
the end of her letter desired it might be returned to her. D'Alembert,
who in his note said the work gave me a decided superiority, and
ought to place me at the head of men of letters, did not sign what he
wrote, although he had signed every note I had before received from
him. Duclos, a sure friend, a man of veracity, but circumspect,
although he had a good opinion of the work, avoided mentioning it in
his letters to me. La Condomine fell upon the Confession of Faith,
and wandered from the subject. Clairaut confined himself to the
same part; but he was not afraid of expressing to me the emotion
which the reading of it had caused in him, and in the most direct
terms wrote to me that it had warmed his old imagination: of all those
to whom I had sent my book, he was the only person who spoke
freely what he thought of it.
Mathas, to whom I also had given a copy before the publication,
lent it to M. de Blaire, counsellor in the parliament of Strasbourg. M.
de Blaire had a country-house at St. Gratien, and Mathas, his old
acquaintance, sometimes went to see him there. He made him read
Emilius before it was published. When he returned it to him, M. de
Blaire expressed himself in the following terms, which were repeated
to me the same day: "M. Mathas, this is a very fine work, but it will in
a short time be spoken of more than, for the author might be
wished." I laughed at the prediction, and saw in it nothing more than
the importance of a man of the robe, who treats everything with an
air of mystery. All the alarming observations repeated to me made no
impression upon my mind, and, far from foreseeing the catastrophe
so near at hand, certain of the utility and excellence of my work, and
that I had in every respect conformed to established rules;
convinced, as I thought I was that I should be supported by all the
credit of M. de Luxembourg and the favor of the ministry, I was
satisfied with myself for the resolution I had taken to retire in the

midst of my triumphs, and at my return to crush those by whom I was
envied.
One thing in the publication of the work alarmed me, less on
account of my safety than for the unburdening of my mind. At the
Hermitage and at Montmorency I had seen with indignation the
vexations which the jealous care of the pleasures of princes causes
to be exercised on wretched peasants, forced to suffer the havoc
made by game in their fields, without daring to take any other
measure to prevent this devastation than that of making a noise,
passing the night amongst the beans and peas, with drums, kettles
and bells, to keep off the wild boars. As I had been a witness to the
barbarous cruelty with which the Comte de Charolois treated these
poor people, I had toward the end of Emilius exclaimed against it.
This was another infraction of my maxims, which has not remained
unpunished. I was informed that the people of the Prince of Conti
were but little less severe upon his, estates; I trembled less that
prince, for whom I was penetrated with respect and gratitude, should
take to his own account what shocked humanity had made me say
on that of others, and feel himself offended. Yet, as my conscience
fully acquitted me upon this article, I made myself easy, and by so
doing acted wisely: at least, I have not heard that this great prince
took notice of the passage, which, besides, was written long before I
had the honor of being known to him.
A few days either before or after the publication of my work, for I
do not exactly recollect the time, there appeared another work upon
the same subject, taken verbatim from my first volume, except a few
stupid things which were joined to the extract. The book bore the
name of a Genevese, one Balexsert, and, according to the title-page,
had gained the premium in the Academy of Harlem. I easily
imagined the academy and the premium to be newly founded, the
better to conceal the plagiarism from the eyes of the public; but I
further perceived there was some prior intrigue which I could not
unravel; either by the lending of my manuscript, without which the
theft could not have been committed, or for the purpose of forging
the story of the pretended premium, to which it was necessary to
give some foundation. It was not until several years afterwards, that

by a word which escaped D'Ivernois, I penetrated the mystery and
discovered those by whom Balexsert had been brought forward.
The low murmurings which precede a storm began to be heard,
and men of penetration clearly saw there was something gathering,
relative to me and my book, which would shortly break over my
head. For my part my stupidity was such, that, far from foreseeing
my misfortune, I did not suspect even the cause of it after I had felt
its effect. It was artfully given out that while the Jesuits were treated
with severity, no indulgence could be shown to books nor the authors
of them in which religion was attacked. I was reproached with having
put my name to Emilius, as if I had not put it to all my other works of
which nothing was said. Government seemed to fear it should be
obliged to take some steps which circumstances rendered necessary
on account of my imprudence. Rumors to this effect reached my
ears, but gave me not much uneasiness: it never even came into my
head, that there could be the least thing in the whole affair which
related to me personally, so perfectly irreproachable and well
supported did I think myself; having besides conformed to every
ministerial regulation, I did not apprehend Madam de Luxembourg
would leave me in difficulties for an error, which, if it existed,
proceeded entirely from herself. But knowing the manner of
proceeding in like cases, and that it was customary to punish
booksellers while authors were favored; I had some uneasiness on
account of poor Duchesne, whom I saw exposed to danger, should
M. de Malesherbes abandon him.
My tranquility still continued. Rumors increased and soon changed
their nature. The public, and especially the parliament, seemed
irritated by my composure. In a few days the fermentation became
terrible, and the object of the menaces being changed, these were
immediately addressed to me. The parliamentarians were heard to
declare that burning books was of no effect, the authors also should
be burned with them; not a word was said of the booksellers. The
first time these expressions, more worthy of an inquisitor of Goa than
a senator, were related to me, I had no doubt of their coming from
the Holbachiques with an intention to alarm me and drive me from
France. I laughed at their puerile manoeuvre, and said they would,
had they known the real state of things, have thought of some other

means of inspiring me with fear; but the rumor at length became
such that I perceived the matter was serious. M. and Madam de
Luxembourg had this year come to Montmorency in the month of
June, which, for their second journey, was more early than common.
I heard but little there of my new books, notwithstanding the noise
they made in Paris; neither the marechal nor his lady said a single
word to me on the subject. However, one morning, when M. de
Luxembourg and I were together, he asked me if, in the 'Social
Contract', I had spoken ill of M. de Choiseul. "I?" said I, retreating a
few steps with surprise; "no, I swear to you I have not; but on the
contrary, I have made on him, and with a pen not given to praise, the
finest eulogium a minister ever received." I then showed him the
passage. "And in Emilius?" replied he. "Not a word," said I; "there is
not in it a single word which relates to him."--"Ah!" said he, with more
vivacity than was common to him, "you should have taken the same
care in the other book, or have expressed yourself more clearly!" "I
thought," replied I, "what I wrote could not be misconstrued; my
esteem for him was such as to make me extremely cautious not to
be equivocal."
He was again going to speak; I perceived him ready to open his
mind: he stopped short and held his tongue. Wretched policy of a
courtier, which in the best of hearts, subjugates friendship itself!
This conversation although short, explained to me my situation, at
least in certain respects, and gave me to understand that it was
against myself the anger of administration was raised. The unheard
of fatality, which turned to my prejudice all the good I did and wrote,
afflicted my heart. Yet, feeling myself shielded in this affair by Madam
de Luxembourg and M. de Malesherbes, I did not perceive in what
my persecutors could deprive me of their protection. However, I,
from that moment was convinced equity and judgment were no
longer in question, and that no pains would be spared in examining
whether or not I was culpable. The storm became still more
menacing. Neaulme himself expressed to me, in the excess of his
babbling, how much he repented having had anything to do in the
business, and his certainty of the fate with which the book and the
author were threatened. One thing, however, alleviated my fears:
Madam de Luxembourg was so calm, satisfied and cheerful, that I

concluded she must necessarily be certain of the sufficiency of her
credit, especially if she did not seem to have the least apprehension
on my account; moreover, she said not to me a word either of
consolation or apology, and saw the turn the affair took with as much
unconcern as if she had nothing to do with it or anything else that
related to me. What surprised me most was her silence. I thought
she should have said something on the subject. Madam de Boufflers
seemed rather uneasy. She appeared agitated, strained herself a
good deal, assured me the Prince of Conti was taking great pains to
ward off the blow about to be directed against my person, and which
she attributed to the nature of present circumstances, in which it was
of importance to the parliament not to leave the Jesuits an opening
whereby they might bring an accusation against it as being
indifferent with respect to religion. She did not, however, seem to
depend much either upon the success of her own efforts or even
those of the prince. Her conversations, more alarming than
consolatory, all tended to persuade me to leave the kingdom and go
to England, where she offered me an introduction to many of her
friends, amongst others one to the celebrated Hume, with whom she
had long been upon a footing of intimate friendship. Seeing me still
unshaken, she had recourse to other arguments more capable of
disturbing my tranquillity. She intimated that, in case I was arrested
and interrogated, I should be under the necessity of naming Madam
de Luxembourg, and that her friendship for me required, on my part,
such precautions as were necessary to prevent her being exposed.
My answer was, that should what she seemed to apprehend come to
pass, she need not be alarmed; that I should do nothing by which the
lady she mentioned might become a sufferer. She said such a
resolution was more easily taken than adhered to, and in this she
was right, especially with respect to me, determined as I always
have been neither to prejudice myself nor lie before judges,
whatever danger there might be in speaking the truth.
Perceiving this observation had made some impression upon my
mind, without however inducing me to resolve upon evasion, she
spoke of the Bastile for a few weeks, as a means of placing me
beyond the reach of the jurisdiction of the parliament, which has
nothing to do with prisoners of state. I had no objection to this

singular favor, provided it were not solicited in my name. As she
never spoke of it a second time, I afterwards thought her proposition
was made to sound me, and that the party did not think proper to
have recourse to an expedient which would have put an end to
everything.
A few days afterwards the marechal received from the Cure de
Dueil, the friend of Grimm and Madam d'Epinay, a letter informing
him, as from good authority, that the parliament was to proceed
against me with the greatest severity, and that, on a day which he
mentioned, an order was to be given to arrest me. I imagined this
was fabricated by the Holbachiques; I knew the parliament to be very
attentive to forms, and that on this occasion, beginning by arresting
me before it was juridically known I avowed myself the author of the
book was violating them all. I observed to Madam de Boufflers that
none but persons accused of crimes which tend to endanger the
public safety were, on a simple information ordered to be arrested
lest they should escape punishment. But when government wish to
punish a crime like mine, which merits honor and recompense, the
proceedings are directed against the book, and the author is as
much as possible left out of the question.
Upon this she made some subtle distinction, which I have
forgotten, to prove that ordering me to be arrested instead of
summoning me to be heard was a matter of favor. The next day I
received a letter from Guy, who informed me that having in the
morning been with the attorney-general, he had seen in his office a
rough draft of a requisition against Emilius and the author. Guy, it is
to be remembered, was the partner of Duchesne, who had printed
the work, and without apprehensions on his own account, charitably
gave this information to the author. The credit I gave to him maybe
judged of.
It was, no doubt, a very probable story, that a bookseller, admitted
to an audience by the attorney-general, should read at ease
scattered rough drafts in the office of that magistrate! Madam de
Boufflers and others confirmed what he had said. By the absurdities
which were incessantly rung in my ears, I was almost tempted to
believe that everybody I heard speak had lost their senses.

Clearly perceiving that there was some mystery, which no one
thought proper to explain to me, I patiently awaited the event,
depending upon my integrity and innocence, and thinking myself
happy, let the persecution which awaited me be what it would, to be
called to the honor of suffering in the cause of truth. Far from being
afraid and concealing myself, I went every day to the castle, and in
the afternoon took my usual walk. On the eighth of June, the evening
before the order was concluded on, I walked in company with two
professors of the oratory, Father Alamanni and Father Mandard. We
carried to Champeaux a little collation, which we ate with a keen
appetite. We had forgotten to bring glasses, and supplied the want of
them by stalks of rye, through which we sucked up the wine from the
bottle, piquing ourselves upon the choice of large tubes to vie with
each other in pumping up what we drank. I never was more cheerful
in my life.
I have related in what manner I lost my sleep during my youth. I
had since that time contracted a habit of reading every night in my
bed, until I found my eyes begin to grow heavy. I then extinguished
my wax taper, and endeavored to slumber for a few moments, which
were in general very short. The book I commonly read at night was
the Bible, which, in this manner I read five or six times from the
beginning to the end. This evening, finding myself less disposed to
sleep than ordinary, I continued my reading beyond the usual hour,
and read the whole book which finishes at the Levite of Ephraim, the
Book of judges, if I mistake not, for since that time I have never once
seen it. This history affected me exceedingly, and, in a kind of a
dream, my imagination still ran on it, when suddenly I was roused
from my stupor by a noise and light. Theresa carrying a candle,
lighted M. la Roche, who perceiving me hastily raise myself up, said:
"Do not be alarmed; I come from Madam de Luxembourg, who, in
her letter incloses you another from the Prince of Conti." In fact, in
the letter of Madam de Luxembourg I found another, which an
express from the prince had brought her, stating that,
notwithstanding all his efforts, it was determined to proceed against
me with the utmost rigor. "The fermentation," said he, "is extreme;
nothing can ward off the blow; the court requires it, and the
parliament will absolutely proceed; at seven o'clock in the morning

an order will be made to arrest him, and persons will immediately be
sent to execute it. I have obtained a promise that he shall not be
pursued if he makes his escape; but if he persists in exposing
himself to be taken this will immediately happen." La Roche conjured
me in behalf of Madam de Luxembourg to rise and go and speak to
her. It was two o'clock and she had just retired to bed. "She expects
you," added he, "and will not go to sleep without speaking to you." I
dressed myself in haste and ran to her.
She appeared to be agitated; this was for the first time. Her
distress affected me. In this moment of surprise and in the night, I
myself was not free from emotion; but on seeing her I forgot my own
situation, and thought of nothing but the melancholy part she would
have to act should I suffer myself to be arrested; for feeling I had
sufficient courage strictly to adhere to truth, although I might be
certain of its being prejudicial or even destructive to me, I was
convinced I had not presence of mind, address, nor perhaps
firmness enough, not to expose her should I be closely pressed. This
determined me to sacrifice my reputation to her tranquillity, and to do
for her that which nothing could have prevailed upon me to do for
myself. The moment I had come to this resolution, I declared it,
wishing not to diminish the magnitude of the sacrifice by giving her
the least trouble to obtain it. I am sure she could not mistake my
motive, although she said not a word, which proved to me she was
sensible of it. I was so much shocked at her indifference that I, for a
moment, thought of retracting; but the marechal came in, and
Madam de Bouffiers arrived from Paris a few moments afterwards.
They did what Madam de Luxembourg ought to have done. I
suffered myself to be flattered; I was ashamed to retract; and the
only thing that remained to be determined upon was the place of my
retreat and the time of my departure. M. de Luxembourg proposed to
me to remain incognito a few days at the castle, that we might
deliberate at leisure, and take such measures as should seem most
proper; to this I would not consent, no more than to go secretly to the
temple. I was determined to set off the same day rather than remain
concealed in any place whatever.
Knowing I had secret and powerful enemies in the kingdom, I
thought, notwithstanding my attachment to France, I ought to quit it,

the better to insure my future tranquillity. My first intention was to
retire to Geneva, but a moment of reflection was sufficient to
dissuade me from committing that act of folly; I knew the ministry of
France, more powerful at Geneva than at Paris, would not leave me
more at peace in one of these cities than in the other, were a
resolution taken to torment me. I was also convinced the 'Discourse
upon Inequality' had excited against me in the council a hatred the
more dangerous as the council dared not make it manifest. I had
also learned, that when the New Eloisa appeared, the same council
had immediately forbidden the sale of that work, upon the solicitation
of Doctor Tronchin; but perceiving the example not to be imitated,
even in Paris, the members were ashamed of what they had done,
and withdrew the prohibition.
I had no doubt that, finding in the present case a more favorable
opportunity, they would be very careful to take advantage of it.
Notwithstanding exterior appearances, I knew there reigned against
me in the heart of every Genevese a secret jealousy, which, in the
first favorable moment, would publicly show itself. Nevertheless, the
love of my country called me to it, and could I have flattered myself I
should there have lived in peace, I should not have hesitated; but
neither honor nor reason permitting me to take refuge as a fugitive in
a place of which I was a citizen, I resolved to approach it only, and to
wait in Switzerland until something relative to me should be
determined upon in Geneva. This state of uncertainty did not, as it
will soon appear, continue long.
Madam de Boufflers highly disapproved this resolution, and
renewed her efforts to induce me to go to England, but all she could
say was of no effect; I had never loved England nor the English, and
the eloquence of Madam de Boufflers, far from conquering my
repugnancy, seemed to increase it without my knowing why.
Determined to set off the same day, I was from the morning
inaccessible to everybody, and La Roche, whom I sent to fetch my
papers, would not tell Theresa whether or not I was gone. Since I
had determined to write my own memoirs, I had collected a great
number of letters and other papers, so that he was obliged to return
several times. A part of these papers, already selected, were laid
aside, and I employed the morning in sorting the rest, that I might

take with me such only as were necessary and destroy what
remained.
M. de Luxembourg, was kind enough to assist me in this business,
which we could not finish before it was necessary I should set off,
and I had not time to burn a single paper. The marechal offered to
take upon himself to sort what I should leave behind me, and throw
into the fire every sheet that he found useless, without trusting to any
person whomsoever, and to send me those of which he should make
choice. I accepted his offer, very glad to be delivered from that care,
that I might pass the few hours I had to remain with persons so dear
to me, from whom I was going to separate forever. He took the key
of the chamber in which I had left these papers; and, at my earnest
solicitation, sent for my poor aunt, who, not knowing what had
become of me, or what was to become of herself, and in momentary
expectation of the arrival of the officers of justice, without knowing
how to act or what to answer them, was miserable to an extreme. La
Roche accompanied her to the castle in silence; she thought I was
already far from Montmorency; on perceiving me, she made the
place resound with her cries, and threw herself into my arms. Oh,
friendship, affinity of sentiment, habit and intimacy.
In this pleasing yet cruel moment, the remembrance of so many
days of happiness, tenderness and peace, passed together
augmented the grief of a first separation after an union of seventeen
years during which we had scarcely lost sight of each other for a
single day.

The marechal who saw this embrace, could not suppress his
tears. He withdrew. Theresa determined never more to leave me out
of her sight. I made her feel the inconvenience of accompanying me
at that moment, and the necessity of her remaining to take care of
my effects and collect my money. When an order is made to arrest a
man, it is customary to seize his papers and put a seal upon his
effects, or to make an inventory of them and appoint a guardian to
whose care they are intrusted. It was necessary Theresa should
remain to observe what passed, and get everything settled in the
most advantageous manner possible. I promised her she should

shortly come to me; the marechal confirmed my promise; but I did
not choose to tell her to what place I was going, that, in case of
being interrogated by the persons who came to take me into custody,
she might with truth plead ignorance upon that head. In embracing
her the moment before we separated I felt within me a most
extraordinary emotion, and I said to her with an agitation which, alas!
was but too prophetic: "My dear girl, you must arm yourself with
courage. You have partaken of my prosperity; it now remains to you,
since you have chosen it, to partake of my misery. Expect nothing in
future but insult and calamity in following me. The destiny begun for
me by this melancholy day will pursue me until my latest hour."
I had now nothing to think of but my departure. The officers were
to arrive at ten o'clock. It was four in the afternoon when I set off, and
they were not yet come. It was determined I should take post. I had
no carriage, The marechal made me a present of a cabriolet, and
lent me horses and a postillion the first stage, where, in
consequence of the measures he had taken, I had no difficulty in
procuring others.
As I had not dined at table, nor made my appearance in the castle,
the ladies came to bid me adieu in the entresol where I had passed
the day. Madam de Luxembourg embraced me several times with a
melancholy air; but I did not in these embraces feel the pressing I
had done in those she had lavished upon me two or three years
before. Madam de Boufflers also embraced me, and said to me
many civil things. An embrace which surprised me more than all the
rest had done was one from Madam de Mirepoix, for she also was at
the castle. Madam la Marechale de Mirepoix is a person extremely
cold, decent, and reserved, and did not, at least as she appeared to
me, seem quite exempt from the natural haughtiness of the house of
Lorraine. She had never shown me much attention. Whether,
flattered by an honor I had not expected, I endeavored to enhance
the value of it; or that there really was in the embrace a little of that
commiseration natural to generous hearts, I found in her manner and
look something energetical which penetrated me. I have since that
time frequently thought that, acquainted with my destiny, she could
not refrain from a momentary concern for my fate.

The marechal did not open his mouth; he was as pale as death.
He would absolutely accompany me to the carriage which waited at
the watering place. We crossed the garden without uttering a single
word. I had a key of the park with which I opened the gate, and
instead of putting it again into my pocket, I held it out to the marechal
without saying a word. He took it with a vivacity which surprised me,
and which has since frequently intruded itself upon my thoughts.
I have not in my whole life had a more bitter moment than that of
this separation. Our embrace was long and silent: we both felt that
this was our last adieu.
Between Barre and Montmorency I met, in a hired carriage, four
men in black, who saluted me smilingly. According to what Theresa
has since told me of the officers of justice, the hour of their arrival
and their manner of behavior, I have no doubt, that they were the
persons I met, especially as the order to arrest me, instead of being
made out at seven o'clock, as I had been told it would, had not been
given till noon. I had to go through Paris. A person in a cabriolet is
not much concealed. I saw several persons in the streets who
saluted me with an air of familiarity but I did not know one of them.
The same evening I changed my route to pass Villeroy. At Lyons the
couriers were conducted to the commandant. This might have been
embarrassing to a man unwilling either to lie or change his name. I
went with a letter from Madam de Luxembourg to beg M. de Villeroy
would spare me this disagreeable ceremony. M. de Villeroy gave me
a letter of which I made no use, because I did not go through Lyons.
This letter still remains sealed up amongst my papers. The duke
pressed me to sleep at Villeroy, but I preferred returning to the great
road, which I did, and travelled two more stages the same evening.
My carriage was inconvenient and uncomfortable, and I was too
much indisposed to go far in a day. My appearance besides was not
sufficiently distinguished for me to be well served, and in France
post-horses feel the whip in proportion to the favorable opinion the
postillion has of his temporary master. By paying the guides
generously thought I should make up for my shabby appearance:
this was still worse. They took me for a worthless fellow who was
carrying orders, and, for the first time in my life, travelling post. From
that moment I had nothing but worn-out hacks, and I became the

sport of the postillions. I ended as I should have begun by being
patient, holding my tongue, and suffering myself to be driven as my
conductors thought proper.
I had sufficient matter of reflection to prevent me from being weary
on the road, employing myself in the recollection of that which had
just happened; but this was neither my turn of mind nor the
inclination of my heart. The facility with which I forget past evils,
however recent they may be, is astonishing. The remembrance of
them becomes feeble, and, sooner or later, effaced, in the inverse
proportion to the greater degree of fear with which the approach of
them inspires me. My cruel imagination, incessantly tormented by
the apprehension of evils still at a distance, diverts my attention, and
prevents me from recollecting those which are past. Caution is
needless after the evil has happened, and it is time lost to give it a
thought. I, in some measure, put a period to my misfortunes before
they happen: the more I have suffered at their approach the greater
is the facility with which I forget them; whilst, on the contrary,
incessantly recollecting my past happiness, I, if I may so speak,
enjoy it a second time at pleasure. It is to this happy disposition I am
indebted for an exemption from that ill humor which ferments in a
vindictive mind, by the continual remembrance of injuries received,
and torments it with all the evil it wishes to do its enemy. Naturally
choleric, I have felt all the force of anger, which in the first moments
has sometimes been carried to fury, but a desire of vengeance never
took root within me. I think too little of the offence to give myself
much trouble about the offender. I think of the injury I have received
from him on account of that he may do me a second time, but were I
certain he would never do me another the first would be instantly
forgotten. Pardon of offences is continually preached to us. I knew
not whether or not my heart would be capable of overcoming its
hatred, for it never yet felt that passion, and I give myself too little
concern about my enemies to have the merit of pardoning them. I
will not say to what a degree, in order to torment me, they torment
themselves. I am at their mercy, they have unbounded power, and
make of it what use they please. There is but one thing in which I set
them at defiance: which is in tormenting themselves about me, to
force me to give myself the least trouble about them.

The day after my departure I had so perfectly forgotten what had
passed, the parliament, Madam de Pompadour, M. de Choiseul,
Grimm, and D'Alembert, with their conspiracies, that had not it been
for the necessary precautions during the journey I should have
thought no more of them. The remembrance of one thing which
supplied the place of all these was what I had read the evening
before my departure. I recollect, also, the pastorals of Gessner,
which his translator Hubert had sent me a little time before. These
two ideas occurred to me so strongly, and were connected in such a
manner in my mind, that I was determined to endeavor to unite them
by treating after the manner of Gessner, the subject of the Levite of
Ephraim. His pastoral and simple style appeared to me but little fitted
to so horrid a subject, and it was not to be presumed the situation I
was then in would furnish me with such ideas as would enliven it.
However, I attempted the thing, solely to amuse myself in my
cabriolet, and without the least hope of success. I had no sooner
begun than I was astonished at the liveliness of my ideas, and the
facility with which I expressed them. In three days I composed the
first three cantos of the little poem I finished at Motiers, and I am
certain of not having done anything in my life in which there is a
more interesting mildness of manners, a greater brilliancy of
coloring, more simple delineations, greater exactness of proportion,
or more antique simplicity in general, notwithstanding the horror of
the subject which in itself is abominable, so that besides every other
merit I had still that of a difficulty conquered. If the Levite of Ephraim
be not the best of my works, it will ever be that most esteemed. I
have never read, nor shall I ever read it again without feeling
interiorly the applause of a heart without acrimony, which, far from
being embittered by misfortunes, is susceptible of consolation in the
midst of them, and finds within itself a resource by which they are
counterbalanced. Assemble the great philosophers, so superior in
their books to adversity which they do not suffer, place them in a
situation similar to mine, and, in the first moments of the indignation
of their injured honor, give them a like work to compose, and it will be
seen in what manner they will acquit themselves of the task.
When I set of from Montmorency to go into Switzerland, I had
resolved to stop at Yverdon, at the house of my old friend Roguin,

who had several years before retired to that place, and had invited
me to go and see him. I was told Lyons was not the direct road, for
which reason I avoided going through it. But I was obliged to pass
through Besancon, a fortified town, and consequently subject to the
same inconvenience. I took it into my head to turn about and to go to
Salins, under the pretense of going to see M. de Marian, the nephew
of M. Dupin, who had an employment at the salt-works, and formerly
had given me many invitations to his house. The expedition
succeeded: M. de Marian was not in the way, and, happily, not being
obliged to stop, I continued my journey without being spoken to by
anybody.
The moment I was within the territory of Berne, I ordered the
postillion to stop; I got out of my carriage, prostrated myself, kissed
the ground, and exclaimed in a transport of joy: "Heaven, the
protector of virtue be praised, I touch a land of liberty!" Thus blind
and unsuspecting in my hopes, have I ever been passionately
attached to that which was to make me unhappy. The man thought
me mad. I got into the carriage, and a few hours afterwards I had the
pure and lively satisfaction of feeling myself pressed within the arms
of the respectable Rougin. Ah! let me breathe for a moment with this
worthy host! It is necessary I should gain strength and courage
before I proceed further. I shall soon find that in my way which will
give employment to them both. It is not without reason that I have
been diffuse in the recital of all the circumstances I have been able
to recollect. Although they may seem uninteresting, yet, when once
the thread of the conspiracy is got hold of, they may throw some light
upon the progress of it; and, for instance, without giving the first idea
of the problem I am going to propose, afford some aid in solving it.
Suppose that, for the execution of the conspiracy of which I was
the object, my absence was absolutely necessary, everything
tending to that effect could not have happened otherwise than it did;
but if without suffering myself to be alarmed by the nocturnal
embassy of Madam de Luxembourg, I had continued to hold out,
and, instead of remaining at the castle, had returned to my bed and
quietly slept until morning, should I have equally had an order of
arrest made out against me? This is a great question upon which the
solution of many others depends, and for the examination of it, the

hour of the comminatory decree of arrest, and that of the real decree
may be remarked to advantage. A rude but sensible example of the
importance of the least detail in the exposition of facts, of which the
secret causes are sought for to discover them by induction.

With this book begins the work of darkness, in which I have for the
last eight years been enveloped, though it has not by any means
been possible for me to penetrate the dreadful obscurity. In the
abyss of evil into which I am plunged, I feel the blows reach me,
without perceiving the hand by which they are directed or the means
it employs. Shame and misfortune seem of themselves to fall upon
me. When in the affliction of my heart I suffer a groan to escape me,
I have the appearance of a man who complains without reason, and
the authors of my ruin have the inconceivable art of rendering the
public unknown to itself, or without its perceiving the effects of it,
accomplice in their conspiracy. Therefore, in my narrative of
circumstances relative to myself, of the treatment I have received,
and all that has happened to me, I shall not be able to indicate the
hand by which the whole has been directed, nor assign the causes,
while I state the effect. The primitive causes are all given in the
preceding books; and everything in which I am interested, and all the
secret motives pointed out. But it is impossible for me to explain,
even by conjecture, that in which the different causes are combined
to operate the strange events of my life. If amongst my readers one
even of them should be generous enough to wish to examine the
mystery to the bottom, and discover the truth, let him carefully read
over a second time the three preceding books, afterwards at each
fact he shall find stated in the books which follow, let him gain such
information as is within his reach, and go back from intrigue to
intrigue, and from agent to agent, until he comes to the first mover of
all. I know where his researches will terminate; but in the meantime I

lose myself in the crooked and obscure subterraneous path through
which his steps must be directed.
During my stay at Yverdon, I became acquainted with all the family
of my friend Roguin, and amongst others with his niece, Madam Boy
de la Tour, and her daughters, whose father, as I think I have already
observed, I formerly knew at Lyons. She was at Yverdon, upon a visit
to her uncle and his sister; her eldest daughter, about fifteen years of
age, delighted me by her fine understanding and excellent
disposition. I conceived the most tender friendship for the mother
and the daughter. The latter was destined by M. Rougin to the
colonel, his nephew, a man already verging towards the decline of
life, and who showed me marks of great esteem and affection; but
although the heart of the uncle was set upon this marriage, which
was much wished for by the nephew also, and I was greatly desirous
to promote the satisfaction of both, the great disproportion of age,
and the extreme repugnancy of the young lady, made me join with
the mother in postponing the ceremony, and the affair was at length
broken off. The colonel has since married Mademoiselle Dillan, his
relation, beautiful, and amiable as my heart could wish, and who has
made him the happiest of husbands and fathers. However, M.
Rougin has not yet forgotten my opposition to his wishes. My
consolation is in the certainty of having discharged to him, and his
family, the duty of the most pure friendship, which does not always
consist in being agreeable, but in advising for the best.
I did not remain long in doubt about the reception which awaited
me at Geneva, had I chosen to return to that city. My book was
burned there, and on the th of June, nine days after an order to
arrest me had been given at Paris, another to the same effect was
determined upon by the republic. So many incredible absurdities
were stated in this second decree, in which the ecclesiastical edict
was formally violated, that I refused to believe the first accounts I
heard of it, and when these were well confirmed, I trembled lest so
manifest an infraction of every law, beginning with that of commonsense, should create the greatest confusion in the city. I was,
however, relieved from my fears; everything remained quiet. If there
was any rumor amongst the populace, it was unfavorable to me, and

I was publicly treated by all the gossips and pedants like a scholar
threatened with a flogging for not having said his catechism.
These two decrees were the signal for the cry of malediction,
raised against me with unexampled fury in every part of Europe. All
the gazettes, journals and pamphlets, rang the alarm-bell. The
French especially, that mild, generous, and polished people, who so
much pique themselves upon their attention and proper
condescension to the unfortunate, instantly forgetting their favorite
virtues, signalized themselves by the number and violence of the
outrages with which, while each seemed to strive who should afflict
me most, they overwhelmed me. I was impious, an atheist, a
madman, a wild beast, a wolf. The continuator of the Journal of
Trevoux was guilty of a piece of extravagance in attacking my
pretended Lycanthropy, which was by no means proof of his own. A
stranger would have thought an author in Paris was afraid of
incurring the animadversion of the police, by publishing a work of
any kind without cramming into it some insult to me. I sought in vain
the cause of this unanimous animosity, and was almost tempted to
believe the world was gone mad. What! said I to myself, the editor of
the 'Perpetual Peace', spread discord; the author of the 'Confession
of the Savoyard Vicar', impious; the writer of the 'New Eloisa', a wolf;
the author of 'Emilius', a madman! Gracious God! what then should I
have been had I published the 'Treatise de l'Esprit', or any similar
work? And yet, in the storm raised against the author of that book,
the public, far from joining the cry of his persecutors, revenged him
of them by eulogium. Let his book and mine, the receptions the two
works met with, and the treatment of the two authors in the different
countries of Europe, be compared; and for the difference let causes
satisfactory to, a man of sense be found, and I will ask no more.
I found the residence of Yverdon so agreeable that I resolved to
yield to the solicitations of M. Roguin and his family, who, were
desirous of keeping me there. M. de Moiry de Gingins, bailiff of that
city, encouraged me by his goodness to remain within his
jurisdiction. The colonel pressed me so much to accept for my
habitation a little pavilion he had in his house between the court and
the garden, that I complied with his request, and he immediately

furnished it with everything necessary for my little household
establishment.
The banneret Roguin, one of the persons who showed me the
most assiduous attention, did not leave me for an instant during the
whole day. I was much flattered by his civilities, but they sometimes
importuned me. The day on which I was to take possession of my
new habitation was already fixed, and I had written to Theresa to
come to me, when suddenly a storm was raised against me in
Berne, which was attributed to the devotees, but I have never been
able to learn the cause of it. The senate, excited against me, without
my knowing by whom, did not seem disposed to suffer me to remain
undisturbed in my retreat. The moment the bailiff was informed of the
new fermentation, he wrote in my favor to several of the members of
the government, reproaching them with their blind intolerance, and
telling them it was shameful to refuse to a man of merit, under
oppression, the asylum which such a numerous banditti found in
their states. Sensible people were of opinion the warmth of his
reproaches had rather embittered than softened the minds of the
magistrates. However this may be, neither his influence nor
eloquence could ward off the blow. Having received an intimation of
the order he was to signify to me, he gave me a previous
communication of it; and that I might wait its arrival, I resolved to set
off the next day. The difficulty was to know where to go, finding
myself shut out from Geneva and all France, and foreseeing that in
the affair each state would be anxious to imitate its neighbor.
Madam Boy de la Tour proposed to me to go and reside in an
uninhabited but completely furnished house, which belonged to her
son in the village of Motiers, in the Val de Travers, in the county of
Neuchatel. I had only a mountain to cross to arrive at it. The offer
came the more opportunely, as in the states of the King of Prussia I
should naturally be sheltered from all persecution, at least religion
could not serve as a pretext for it. But a secret difficulty: improper for
me at that moment to divulge, had in it that which was very sufficient
to make me hesitate. The innnate love of justice, to which my heart
was constantly subject, added to my secret inclination to France, had
inspired me with an aversion to the King of Prussia, who by his
maxims and conduct, seemed to tread under foot all respect for

natural law and every duty of humanity. Amongst the framed
engravings, with which I had decorated my alcove at Montmorency,
was a portrait of this prince, and under it a distich, the last line of
which was as follows:
[Il pense en philosophe, et se conduit en roi.
[He thinks like a philosopher, and acts like a king.]
This verse, which from any other pen would have been a fine
eulogium, from mine had an unequivocal meaning, and too clearly
explained the verse by which it was preceded. The distich had been,
read by everybody who came to see me, and my visitors were
numerous. The Chevalier de Lorenzy had even written it down to
give it to D'Alembert, and I had no doubt but D' Alembert had taken
care to make my court with it to the prince. I had also aggravated this
first fault by a passage in 'Emilius', where under the name of
Adrastus, king of the Daunians, it was clearly seen whom I had in
view, and the remark had not escaped critics, because Madam de
Boufflers had several times mentioned the subject to me. I was,
therefore, certain of being inscribed in red ink in the registers of the
King of Prussia, and besides, supposing his majesty to have the
principles I had dared to attribute to him, he, for that reason, could
not but be displeased with my writings and their author; for
everybody knows the worthless part of mankind, and tyrants have
never failed to conceive the most mortal hatred against me, solely on
reading my works, without being acquainted with my person.
However, I had presumption enough to depend upon his mercy,
and was far from thinking I ran much risk. I knew none but weak men
were slaves to the base passions, and that these had but little power
over strong minds, such as I had always thought his to be. According
to his art of reigning, I thought he could not but show himself
magnanimous on this occasion, and that being so in fact was not
above his character. I thought a mean and easy vengeance would
not for a moment counterbalance his love of glory, and putting myself
in his place, his taking advantage of circumstances to overwhelm

with the weight of his generosity a man who had dared to think ill of
him, did not appear to me impossible. I therefore went to settle at
Motiers, with a confidence of which I imagined he would feel all the
value, and said to myself: When Jean Jacques rises to the elevation
of Coriolanus, will Frederick sink below the General of the Volsci?
Colonel Roguin insisted on crossing the mountain with me, and
installing me at Moiters. A sister-in-law to Madam Boy de la Tour,
named Madam Girardier, to whom the house in which I was going to
live was very convenient, did not see me arrive there with pleasure;
however, she with a good grace put me in possession of my
lodgings, and I eat with her until Theresa came, and my little
establishment was formed.
Perceiving at my departure from Montmorency I should in future
be a fugitive upon the earth, I hesitated about permitting her to come
to me and partake of the wandering life to which I saw myself
condemned. I felt the nature of our relation to each other was about
to change, and that what until then had on my part been favor and
friendship, would in future become so on hers. If her attachment was
proof against my misfortunes, to this I knew she must become a
victim, and that her grief would add to my pain. Should my disgrace
weaken her affections, she would make me consider her constancy
as a sacrifice, and instead of feeling the pleasure I had in dividing
with her my last morsel of bread, she would see nothing but her own
merit in following me wherever I was driven by fate.
I must say everything; I have never concealed the vices either of
my poor mamma or myself; I cannot be more favorable to Theresa,
and whatever pleasure I may have in doing honor to a person who is
dear to me, I will not disguise the truth, although it may discover in
her an error, if an involuntary change of the affections of the heart be
one. I had long perceived hers to grow cooler towards me, and that
she was no longer for me what she had been in our younger days.
Of this I was the more sensible, as for her I was what I had always
been. I fell into the same inconvenience as that of which I had felt
the effect with mamma, and this effect was the same now I was with
Theresa. Let us not seek for perfection, which nature never
produces; it would be the same thing with any other woman. The
manner in which I had disposed of my children, however reasonable

it had appeared to me, had not always left my heart at ease. While
writing my 'Treatise on Education', I felt I had neglected duties with
which it was not possible to dispense. Remorse at length became so
strong that it almost forced from me a public confession of my fault at
the beginning of my 'Emilius', and the passage is so clear, that it is
astonishing any person should, after reading it, have had the
courage to reproach me with my error. My situation was however still
the same, or something worse, by the animosity of my enemies, who
sought to find me in a fault. I feared a relapse, and unwilling to run
the risk, I preferred abstinence to exposing Theresa to a similar
mortification. I had besides remarked that a connection with women
was prejudicial to my health; this double reason made me form
resolutions to which I had but sometimes badly kept, but for the last
three or four years I had more constantly adhered to them. It was in
this interval I had remarked Theresa's coolness; she had the same
attachment to me from duty, but not the least from love. Our
intercourse naturally became less agreeable, and I imagined that,
certain of the continuation of my cares wherever she might be, she
would choose to stay at Paris rather than to wander with me. Yet she
had given such signs of grief at our parting, had required of me such
positive promises that we should meet again, and, since my
departure, had expressed to the Prince de Conti and M. de
Luxembourg so strong a desire of it, that, far from having the
courage to speak to her of separation, I scarcely had enough to think
of it myself; and after having felt in my heart how impossible it was
for me to do without her, all I thought of afterwards was to recall her
to me as soon as possible. I wrote to her to this effect, and she
came. It was scarcely two months since I had quitted her; but it was
our first separation after a union of so many years. We had both of
us felt it most cruelly. What emotion in our first embrace! O how
delightful are the tears of tenderness and joy! How does my heart
drink them up! Why have I not had reason to shed them more
frequently?
On my arrival at Motiers I had written to Lord Keith, marshal of
Scotland and governor of Neuchatel, informing him of my retreat into
the states of his Prussian majesty, and requesting of him his
protection. He answered me with his well-known generosity, and in

the manner I had expected from him. He invited me to his house. I
went with M. Martinet, lord of the manor of Val de Travers, who was
in great favor with his excellency. The venerable appearance of this
illustrious and virtuous Scotchman, powerfully affected my heart, and
from that instant began between him and me the strong attachment,
which on my part still remains the same, and would be so on his, had
not the traitors, who have deprived me of all the consolation of life,
taken advantage of my absence to deceive his old age and
depreciate me in his esteem.
George Keith, hereditary marshal of Scotland, and brother to the
famous General Keith, who lived gloriously and died in the bed of
honor, had quitted his country at a very early age, and was
proscribed on account of his attachment to the house of Stuart. With
that house, however, he soon became disgusted with the unjust and
tyrannical spirit he remarked in the ruling character of the Stuart
family. He lived a long time in Spain, the climate of which pleased
him exceedingly, and at length attached himself, as his brother had
done, to the service of the King of Prussia, who knew men and gave
them the reception they merited. His majesty received a great return
for this reception, in the services rendered him by Marshal Keith, and
by what was infinitely more precious, the sincere friendship of his
lordship. The great mind of this worthy man, haughty and republican,
could stoop to no other yoke than that of friendship, but to this it was
so obedient, that with very different maxims he saw nothing but
Frederic the moment he became attached to him. The king charged
the marshal with affairs of importance, sent him to Paris, to Spain,
and at length, seeing he was already advanced in years, let him
retire with the government of Neuchatel, and the delightful
employment of passing there the remainder of his life in rendering
the inhabitants happy.
The people of Neuchatel, whose manners are trivial, know not how
to distinguish solid merit, and suppose wit to consist in long
discourses. When they saw a sedate man of simple manners appear
amongst them, they mistook his simplicity for haughtiness, his
candor for rusticity, his laconism for stupidity, and rejected his
benevolent cares, because, wishing to be useful, and not being a
sycophant, he knew not how to flatter people he did not esteem. In

the ridiculous affair of the minister Petitpierre, who was displaced by
his colleagues, for having been unwilling they should be eternally
damned, my lord, opposing the usurpations of the ministers, saw the
whole country of which he took the part, rise up against him, and
when I arrived there the stupid murmur had not entirely subsided. He
passed for a man influenced by the prejudices with which he was
inspired by others, and of all the imputations brought against him it
was the most devoid of truth. My first sentiment on seeing this
venerable old man, was that of tender commiseration, on account of
his extreme leanness of body, years having already left him little else
but skin and bone; but when I raised my eyes to his animated, open,
noble countenance, I felt a respect, mingled with confidence, which
absorbed every other sentiment. He answered the very short
compliment I made him when I first came into his presence by
speaking of something else, as if I had already been a week in his
house. He did not bid us sit down. The stupid chatelain, the lord of
the manor, remained standing. For my part I at first sight saw in the
fine and piercing eye of his lordship something so conciliating that,
feeling myself entirely at ease, I without ceremony, took my seat by
his side upon the sofa. By the familiarity of his manner I immediately
perceived the liberty I took gave him pleasure, and that he said to
himself: This is not a Neuchatelois.
Singular effect of the similarity of characters! At an age when the
heart loses its natural warmth, that of this good old man grew warm
by his attachment to me to a degree which surprised everybody. He
came to see me at Motiers under the pretence of quail shooting, and
stayed there two days without touching a gun. We conceived such a
friendship for each other that we knew not how to live separate; the
castle of Colombier, where he passed the summer, was six leagues
from Motiers; I went there at least once a fortnight, and made a stay
of twenty-four hours, and then returned like a pilgrim with my heart
full of affection for my host. The emotion I had formerly experienced
in my journeys from the Hermitage to Raubonne was certainly very
different, but it was not more pleasing than that with which I
approached Columbier.
What tears of tenderness have I shed when on the road to it, while
thinking of the paternal goodness, amiable virtues, and charming

philosophy of this respectable old man! I called him father, and he
called me son. These affectionate names give, in some measure, an
idea of the attachment by which we were united, but by no means
that of the want we felt of each other, nor of our continual desire to
be together. He would absolutely give me an apartment at the castle
of Columbier, and for a long time pressed me to take up my
residence in that in which I lodged during my visits. I at length told
him I was more free and at my ease in my own house, and that I had
rather continue until the end of my life to come and see him. He
approved of my candor, and never afterwards spoke to me on the
subject. Oh, my good lord! Oh, my worthy father! How is my heart
still moved when I think of your goodness? Ah, barbarous wretches!
how deeply did they wound me when they deprived me of your
friendship? But no, great man, you are and ever will be the same for
me, who am still the same. You have been deceived, but you are not
changed. My lord marechal is not without faults; he is a man of
wisdom, but he is still a man. With the greatest penetration, the
nicest discrimination, and the most profound knowledge of men, he
sometimes suffers himself to be deceived, and never recovers his
error. His temper is very singular and foreign to his general turn of
mind. He seems to forget the people he sees every day, and thinks
of them in a moment when they least expect it; his attention seems
ill-timed; his presents are dictated by caprice and not by propriety.
He gives or sends in an instant whatever comes into his head, be the
value of it ever so small. A young Genevese, desirous of entering
into the service of Prussia, made a personal application to him; his
lordship, instead of giving him a letter, gave him a little bag of peas,
which he desired him to carry to the king. On receiving this singular
recommendation his majesty gave a commission to the bearer of it.
These elevated geniuses have between themselves a language
which the vulgar will never understand. The whimsical manner of my
lord marechal, something like the caprice of a fine woman, rendered
him still more interesting to me. I was certain, and afterwards had
proofs, that it had not the least influence over his sentiments, nor did
it affect the cares prescribed by friendship on serious occasions, yet
in his manner of obliging there is the same singularity as in his
manners in general. Of this I will give one instance relative to a

matter of no great importance. The journey from Motiers to
Colombier being too long for me to perform in one day, I commonly
divided it by setting off after dinner and sleeping at Brot, which is half
way. The landlord of the house where I stopped, named Sandoz,
having to solicit at Berlin a favor of importance to him, begged I
would request his excellency to ask it in his behalf. "Most willingly,"
said I, and took him with me. I left him in the antechamber, and
mentioned the matter to his lordship, who returned me no answer.
After passing with him the whole morning, I saw as I crossed the hall
to go to dinner, poor Sandoz, who was fatigued to death with waiting.
Thinking the governor had forgotten what I had said to him, I again
spoke of the business before we sat down to table, but still received
no answer. I thought this manner of making me feel I was
importunate rather severe, and, pitying the poor man in waiting, held
my tongue. On my return the next day I was much surprised at the
thanks he returned me for the good dinner his excellency had given
him after receiving his paper. Three weeks afterwards his lordship
sent him the rescript he had solicited, dispatched by the minister,
and signed by the king, and this without having said a word either to
myself or Sandoz concerning the business, about which I thought he
did not wish to give himself the least concern.
I could wish incessantly to speak of George Keith; from him
proceeds my recollection of the last happy moments I have enjoyed:
the rest of my life, since our separation, has been passed in affliction
and grief of heart. The remembrance of this is so melancholy and
confused that it was impossible for me to observe the least order in
what I write, so that in future I shall be under the necessity of stating
facts without giving them a regular arrangement.
I was soon relieved from my inquietude arising from the
uncertainty of my asylum, by the answer from his majesty to the lord
marshal, in whom, as it will readily be believed, I had found an able
advocate. The king not only approved of what he had done, but
desired him, for I must relate everything, to give me twelve louis. The
good old man, rather embarrassed by the commission, and not
knowing how to execute it properly, endeavored to soften the insult
by transforming the money into provisions, and writing to me that he
had received orders to furnish me with wood and coal to begin my

little establishment; he moreover added, and perhaps from himself,
that his majesty would willingly build me a little house, such a one as
I should choose to have, provided I would fix upon the ground. I was
extremely sensible of the kindness of the last offer, which made me
forget the weakness of the other. Without accepting either, I
considered Frederic as my benefactor and protector, and became so
sincerely attached to him, that from that moment I interested myself
as much in his glory as until then I had thought his successes unjust.
At the peace he made soon after, I expressed my joy by an
illumination in a very good taste: it was a string of garlands, with
which I decorated the house I inhabited, and in which, it is true, I had
the vindictive haughtiness to spend almost as much money as he
had wished to give me. The peace ratified, I thought as he was at the
highest pinnacle of military and political fame, he would think of
acquiring that of another nature, by reanimating his states,
encouraging in them commerce and agriculture, creating a new soil,
covering it with a new people, maintaining peace amongst his
neighbors, and becoming the arbitrator, after having been the terror,
of Europe. He was in a situation to sheath his sword without danger,
certain that no sovereign would oblige him again to draw it.
Perceiving he did not disarm, I was afraid he would profit but little by
the advantages he had gained, and that he would be great only by
halves. I dared to write to him upon the subject, and with a familiarity
of a nature to please men of his character, conveying to him the
sacred voice of truth, which but few kings are worthy to hear. The
liberty I took was a secret between him and myself. I did not
communicate it even to the lord marshal, to whom I sent my letter to
the king sealed up. His lordship forwarded my dispatch without
asking what it contained. His majesty returned me no answer and
the marshal going soon after to Berlin, the king told him he had
received from me a scolding. By this I understood my letter had been
ill received, and the frankness of my zeal had been mistaken for the
rusticity of a pedant. In fact, this might possibly be the case; perhaps
I did not say what was necessary, nor in the manner proper to the
occasion. All I can answer for is the sentiment which induced me to
take up the pen.

Shortly after my establishment at Motiers, Travers having every
possible assurance that I should be suffered to remain there in
peace, I took the Armenian habit. This was not the first time I had
thought of doing it. I had formerly had the same intention, particularly
at Montmorency, where the frequent use of probes often obliging me
to keep my chamber, made me more clearly perceive the
advantages of a long robe. The convenience of an Armenian tailor,
who frequently came to see a relation he had at Montmorency,
almost tempted me to determine on taking this new dress, troubling
myself but little about what the world would say of it. Yet, before I
concluded about the matter, I wished to take the opinion of M. de
Luxembourg, who immediately advised me to follow my inclination. I
therefore procured a little Armenian wardrobe, but on account of the
storm raised against me, I was induced to postpone making use of it
until I should enjoy tranquillity, and it was not until some months
afterwards that, forced by new attacks of my disorder, I thought I
could properly, and without the least risk, put on my new dress at
Motiers, especially after having consulted the pastor of the place,
who told me I might wear it even in the temple without indecency. I
then adopted the waistcoat, caffetan, fur bonnet, and girdle; and
after having in this dress attended divine service, I saw no
impropriety in going in it to visit his lordship. His excellency in seeing
me clothed in this manner made me no other compliment than that
which consisted in saying "Salaam aliakum," i.e., "Peace be with
you;" the common Turkish salutation; after which nothing more was
said upon the subject, and I continued to wear my new dress.
Having quite abandoned literature, all I now thought of was leading
a quiet life, and one as agreeable as I could make it. When alone, I
have never felt weariness of mind, not even in complete inaction; my
imagination filling up every void, was sufficient to keep up my
attention. The inactive babbling of a private circle, where, seated
opposite to each other, they who speak move nothing but the
tongue, is the only thing I have ever been unable to support. When
walking and rambling about there is some satisfaction in
conversation; the feet and eyes do something; but to hear people
with their arms across speak of the weather, of the biting of flies, or
what is still worse, compliment each other, is to me an insupportable

torment. That I might not live like a savage, I took it into my head to
learn to make laces. Like the women, I carried my cushion with me,
when I went to make visits, or sat down to work at my door, and
chatted with passers-by. This made me the better support the
emptiness of babbling, and enabled me to pass my time with my
female neighbors without weariness. Several of these were very
amiable and not devoid of wit. One in particular, Isabella d'Ivernois,
daughter of the attorney-general of Neuchatel, I found so estimable
as to induce me to enter with her into terms of particular friendship,
from which she derived some advantage by the useful advice I gave
her, and the services she received from me on occasions of
importance, so that now a worthy and virtuous mother of a family,
she is perhaps indebted to me for her reason, her husband, her life,
and happiness. On my part, I received from her gentle consolation,
particularly during a melancholy winter, through out the whole of
which when my sufferings were most cruel, she came to pass with
Theresa and me long evenings, which she made very short for us by
her agreeable conversation, and our mutual openness of heart. She
called me papa, and I called her daughter, and these names, which
we still give to each other, will, I hope, continue to be as dear to her
as they are to me. That my laces might be of some utility, I gave
them to my young female friends at their marriages, upon condition
of their suckling their children; Isabella's eldest sister had one upon
these terms, and well deserved it by her observance of them;
Isabella herself also received another, which, by intention she as
fully merited. She has not been happy enough to be able to pursue
her inclination. When I sent the laces to the two sisters, I wrote each
of them a letter; the first has been shown about in the world; the
second has not the same celebrity: friendship proceeds with less
noise.
Amongst the connections I made in my neighborhood, of which I
will not enter into a detail, I must mention that with Colonel Pury, who
had a house upon the mountain, where he came to pass the
summer. I was not anxious to become acquainted with him, because
I knew he was upon bad terms at court, and with the lord marshal,
whom he did not visit. Yet, as he came to see me, and showed me
much attention, I was under the necessity of returning his visit; this

was repeated, and we sometimes dined with each other. At his
house I became acquainted with M. du Perou, and afterwards too
intimately connected with him to pass his name over in silence.
M. du Perou was an American, son to a commandant of Surinam,
whose successor, M. le Chambrier, of Neuchatel, married his widow.
Left a widow a second time, she came with her son to live in the
country of her second husband.
Du Perou, an only son, very rich, and tenderly beloved by his
mother, had been carefully brought up, and his education was not
lost upon him. He had acquired much knowledge, a taste for the arts,
and piqued himself upon his having cultivated his rational faculty: his
Dutch appearance, yellow complexion, and silent and close
disposition, favored this opinion. Although young, he was already
deaf and gouty. This rendered his motions deliberate and very grave,
and although he was fond of disputing, he in general spoke but little
because his hearing was bad. I was struck with his exterior, and said
to myself, this is a thinker, a man of wisdom, such a one as anybody
would be happy to have for a friend. He frequently addressed himself
to me without paying the least compliment, and this strengthened the
favorable opinion I had already formed of him. He said but little to me
of myself or my books, and still less of himself; he was not destitute
of ideas, and what he said was just. This justness and equality
attracted my regard. He had neither the elevation of mind, nor the
discrimination of the lord marshal, but he had all his simplicity: this
was still representing him in something. I did not become infatuated
with him, but he acquired my attachment from esteem; and by
degrees this esteem led to friendship, and I totally forgot the
objection I made to the Baron Holbach: that he was too rich.
For a long time I saw but little of Du Perou, because I did not go to
Neuchatel, and he came but once a year to the mountain of Colonel
Pury. Why did I not go to Neuchatel? This proceeded from a
childishness upon which I must not be silent.
Although protected by the King of Prussia and the lord marshal,
while I avoided persecution in my asylum, I did not avoid the
murmurs of the public, of municipal magistrates and ministers. After
what had happened in France it became fashionable to insult me;
these people would have been afraid to seem to disapprove of what

my persecutors had done by not imitating them. The 'classe' of
Neuchatel, that is, the ministers of that city, gave the impulse, by
endeavoring to move the council of state against me. This attempt
not having succeeded, the ministers addressed themselves to the
municipal magistrate, who immediately prohibited my book, treating
me on all occasions with but little civility, and saying, that had I
wished to reside in the city I should not have been suffered to do it.
They filled their Mercury with absurdities and the most stupid
hypocrisy, which, although, it makes every man of sense laugh,
animated the people against me. This, however, did not prevent
them from setting forth that I ought to be very grateful for their
permitting me to live at Motiers, where they had no authority; they
would willingly have measured me the air by the pint, provided I had
paid for it a dear price. They would have it that I was obliged to them
for the protection the king granted me in spite of the efforts they
incessantly made to deprive me of it. Finally, failing of success, after
having done me all the injury they could, and defamed me to the
utmost of their power, they made a merit of their impotence, by
boasting of their goodness in suffering me to stay in their country. I
ought to have laughed at their vain efforts, but I was foolish enough
to be vexed at them, and had the weakness to be unwilling to go to
Neuchatel, to which I yielded for almost two years, as if it was not
doing too much honor to such wretches, to pay attention to their
proceedings, which, good or bad, could not be imputed to them,
because they never act but from a foreign impulse. Besides, minds
without sense or knowledge, whose objects of esteem are influence,
power and money, and far from imagining even that some respect is
due to talents, and that it is dishonorable to injure and insult them.
A certain mayor of a village, who from sundry malversations had
been deprived of his office, said to the lieutenant of Val de Travers,
the husband of Isabella: "I am told this Rousseau has great wit,-bring him to me that I may see whether he has or not." The
disapprobation of such a man ought certainly to have no effect upon
those on whom it falls.
After the treatment I had received at Paris, Geneva, Berne, and
even at Neuchatel, I expected no favor from the pastor of this place.
I had, however, been recommended to him by Madam Boy de la

Tour, and he had given me a good reception; but in that country
where every new-comer is indiscriminately flattered, civilities signify
but little. Yet, after my solemn union with the reformed church, and
living in a Protestant country, I could not, without failing in my
engagements, as well as in the duty of a citizen, neglect the public
profession of the religion into which I had entered; I therefore
attended divine service. On the other hand, had I gone to the holy
table, I was afraid of exposing myself to a refusal, and it was by no
means probable, that after the tumult excited at Geneva by the
council, and at Neuchatel by the classe (the ministers), he would,
without difficulty administer to me the sacrament in his church. The
time of communion approaching, I wrote to M. de Montmollin, the
minister, to prove to him my desire of communicating, and declaring
myself heartily united to the Protestant church; I also told him, in
order to avoid disputing upon articles of faith, that I would not
hearken to any particular explanation of the point of doctrine. After
taking these steps I made myself easy, not doubting but M. de
Montmollin would refuse to admit me without the preliminary
discussion to which I refused to consent, and that in this manner
everything would be at an end without any fault of mine. I was
deceived: when I least expected anything of the kind, M. de
Montmollin came to declare to me not only that he admitted me to
the communion under the condition which I had proposed, but that
he and the elders thought themselves much honored by my being
one of their flock. I never in my whole life felt greater surprise or
received from it more consolation. Living always alone and
unconnected, appeared to me a melancholy destiny, especially in
adversity. In the midst of so many proscriptions and persecutions, I
found it extremely agreeable to be able to say to myself: I am at least
amongst my brethren; and I went to the communion with an emotion
of heart, and my eyes suffused with tears of tenderness, which
perhaps were the most agreeable preparation to Him to whose table
I was drawing near.
Sometime afterwards his lordship sent me a letter from Madam de
Boufflers, which he had received, at least I presumed so, by means
of D'Alembert, who was acquainted with the marechal. In this letter,
the first this lady had written to me after my departure from

Montmorency, she rebuked me severely for having written to M. de
Montmollin, and especially for having communicated. I the less
understood what she meant by her reproof, as after my journey to
Geneva, I had constantly declared myself a Protestant, and had
gone publicly to the Hotel de Hollande without incurring the least
censure from anybody. It appeared to me diverting enough, that
Madam de Boufflers should wish to direct my conscience in matters
of religion. However, as I had no doubt of the purity of her intention, I
was not offended by this singular sally, and I answered her without
anger, stating to her my reasons.
Calumnies in print were still industriously circulated, and their
benign authors reproached the different powers with treating me too
mildly. For my part, I let them say and write what they pleased,
without giving myself the least concern about the matter. I was told
there was a censure from the Sorbonne, but this I could not believe.
What could the Sorbonne have to do in the matter? Did the doctors
wish to know to a certainty that I was not a Catholic? Everybody
already knew I was not one. Were they desirous of proving I was not
a good Calvinist? Of what consequence was this to them? It was
taking upon themselves a singular care, and becoming the
substitutes of our ministers. Before I saw this publication I thought it
was distributed in the name of the Sorbonne, by way of mockery:
and when I had read it I was convinced this was the case. But when
at length there was not a doubt of its authenticity, all I could bring
myself to believe was, that the learned doctors would have been
better placed in a madhouse than they were in the college.
I was more affected by another publication, because it came from
a man for whom I always had an esteem, and whose constancy I
admired, though I pitied his blindness. I mean the mandatory letter
against me by the archbishop of Paris. I thought to return an answer
to it was a duty I owed myself. This I felt I could do without
derogating from my dignity; the case was something similar to that of
the King of Poland. I had always detested brutal disputes, after the
manner of Voltaire. I never combat but with dignity, and before I
deign to defend myself I must be certain that he by whom I am
attacked will not dishonor my retort. I had no doubt but this letter was
fabricated by the Jesuits, and although they were at that time in

distress, I discovered in it their old principle of crushing the wretched.
I was therefore at liberty to follow my ancient maxim, by honoring the
titulary author, and refuting the work which I think I did completely.
I found my residence at Motiers very agreeable, and nothing was
wanting to determine me to end my days there, but a certainty of the
means of subsistence. Living is dear in that neighborhood, and all
my old projects had been overturned by the dissolution of my
household arrangements at Montmorency, the establishment of
others, the sale or squandering of my furniture, and the expenses
incurred since my departure. The little capital which remained to me
daily diminished. Two or three years were sufficient to consume the
remainder without my having the means of renewing it, except by
again engaging in literary pursuits: a pernicious profession which I
had already abandoned. Persuaded that everything which concerned
me would change, and that the public, recovered from its frenzy,
would make my persecutors blush, all my endeavors tended to
prolong my resources until this happy revolution should take place,
after which I should more at my ease choose a resource from
amongst those which might offer themselves. To this effect I took up
my Dictionary of Music, which ten years' labor had so far advanced
as to leave nothing wanting to it but the last corrections. My books
which I had lately received, enabled me to finish this work; my
papers sent me by the same conveyance, furnished me with the
means of beginning my memoirs to which I was determined to give
my whole attention. I began by transcribing the letters into a book, by
which my memory might be guided in the order of fact and time. I
had already selected those I intended to keep for this purpose, and
for ten years the series was not interrupted. However, in preparing
them for copying I found an interruption at which I was surprised.
This was for almost six months, from October,
, to March
following. I recollected having put into my selection a number of
letters from Diderot, De Leyre, Madam d' Epinay, Madam de
Chenonceaux, etc., which filled up the void and were missing. What
was become of them? Had any person laid their hands upon my
papers whilst they remained in the Hotel de Luxembourg? This was
not conceivable, and I had seen M. de Luxembourg take the key of
the chamber in which I had deposited them. Many letters from

different ladies, and all those from Diderot, were without date, on
which account I had been under the necessity of dating them from
memory before they could be put in order, and thinking I might have
committed errors, I again looked them over for the purpose of seeing
whether or not I could find those which ought to fill up the void. This
experiment did not succeed. I perceived the vacancy to be real, and
that the letters had certainly been taken away. By whom and for what
purpose? This was what I could not comprehend. These letters,
written prior to my great quarrels, and at the time of my first
enthusiasm in the composition of 'Eloisa', could not be interesting to
any person. They contained nothing more than cavillings by Diderot,
jeerings from De Leyre, assurances of friendship from M. de
Chenonceaux, and even Madam d'Epinay, with whom I was then
upon the best of terms. To whom were these letters of
consequence? To what use were they to be put? It was not until
seven years afterwards that I suspected the nature of the theft. The
deficiency being no longer doubtful, I looked over my rough drafts to
see whether or not it was the only one. I found several, which on
account of the badness of my memory, made me suppose others in
the multitude of my papers. Those I remarked were that of the
'Morale Sensitive', and the extract of the adventures of Lord Edward.
The last, I confess, made me suspect Madam de Luxembourg. La
Roche, her valet de chambre, had sent me the papers, and I could
think of nobody but herself to whom this fragment could be of
consequence; but what concern could the other give her, any more
than the rest of the letters missing, with which, even with evil
intentions, nothing to my prejudice could be done, unless they were
falsified? As for the marechal, with whose friendship for me, and
invariable integrity, I was perfectly acquainted, I never could suspect
him for a moment. The most reasonable supposition, after long
tormenting my mind in endeavoring to discover the author of the
theft, that which imputed it to D'Alembert, who, having thrust himself
into the company of Madam de Luxembourg, might have found
means to turn over these papers, and take from amongst them such
manuscripts and letters as he might have thought proper, either for
the purpose of endeavoring to embroil me with the writer of them, or
to appropriate those he should find useful to his own private

purposes. I imagined that, deceived by the title of Morale Sensitive,
he might have supposed it to be the plan of a real treatise upon
materialism, with which he would have armed himself against me in
a manner easy to be imagined. Certain that he would soon be
undeceived by reading the sketch and determined to quit all literary
pursuits, these larcenies gave me but little concern. They besides
were not the first the same hand had committed upon me without
having complained of these pilferings.
[I had found in his 'Elemens de Musique' (Elements of Music)
several things taken from what I had written for the
'Encyclopedie',
and which were given to him several years before the
publication of
his elements. I know not what he may have had to do with a
book
entitled 'Dictionaire des Beaux Arts' (Dictionary of the Fine Arts)
but I found in it articles transcribed word for word from mine, and
this long before the same articles were printed in the
Encyclopedie.]
In a very little time I thought no more of the trick that had been
played me than if nothing had happened, and began to collect the
materials I had left for the purpose of undertaking my projected
confessions.
I had long thought the company of ministers, or at least the
citizens and burgesses of Geneva, would remonstrate against the
infraction of the edict in the decree made against me. Everything
remained quiet, at least to all exterior appearance; for discontent
was general, and ready, on the first opportunity, openly to manifest
itself. My friends, or persons calling themselves such, wrote letter
after letter exhorting me to come and put myself at their head,
assuring me of public separation from the council. The fear of the
disturbance and troubles which might be caused by my presence,
prevented me from acquiescing with their desires, and, faithful to the
oath I had formerly made, never to take the least part in any civil
dissension in my country, I chose rather to let the offence remain as

it was, and banish myself forever from the country, than to return to it
by means which were violent and dangerous. It is true, I expected
the burgesses would make legal remonstrances against an infraction
in which their interests were deeply concerned; but no such steps
were taken. They who conducted the body of citizens sought less the
real redress of grievances than an opportunity to render themselves
necessary. They caballed but were silent, and suffered me to be
bespattered by the gossips and hypocrites set on to render me
odious in the eyes of the populace, and pass upon them their
boistering for a zeal in favor of religion.
After having, during a whole year, vainly expected that some one
would remonstrate against an illegal proceeding, and seeing myself
abandoned by my fellow-citizens, I determined to renounce my
ungrateful country in which I never had lived, from which I had not
received either inheritance or services, and by which, in return for
the honor I had endeavored to do it, I saw myself so unworthily
treated by unanimous consent, since they, who should have spoken,
had remained silent. I therefore wrote to the first syndic for that year,
to M. Favre, if I remember right, a letter in which I solemnly gave up
my freedom of the city of Geneva, carefully observing in it, however,
that decency and moderation, from which I have never departed in
the acts of haughtiness which, in my misfortunes, the cruelty of my
enemies have frequently forced upon me,
This step opened the eyes of the citizens, who feeling they had
neglected their own interests by abandoning my defence, took my
part when it was too late. They had wrongs of their own which they
joined to mine, and made these the subject of several well-reasoned
representations, which they strengthened and extended, as the
refusal of the council, supported by the ministry of France, made
them more clearly perceive the project formed to impose on them a
yoke. These altercations produced several pamphlets which were
undecisive, until that appeared entitled 'Lettres ecrites de la
Campagne', a work written in favor of the council, with infinite art,
and by which the remonstrating party, reduced to silence, was
crushed for a time. This production, a lasting monument of the rare
talents of its author, came from the Attorney-General Tronchin, a

man of wit and an enlightened understanding, well versed in the laws
and government of the republic. 'Siluit terra'.
The remonstrators, recovered from their first overthrow, undertook
to give an answer, and in time produced one which brought them off
tolerably well. But they all looked to me, as the only person capable
of combating a like adversary with hope of success. I confess I was
of their opinion, and excited by my former fellow-citizens, who
thought it was my duty to aid them with my pen, as I had been the
cause of their embarrassment, I undertook to refute the 'Lettres
ecrites de la Campagne', and parodied the title of them by that of
'Lettres ecrites de la Montagne,' which I gave to mine. I wrote this
answer so secretly, that at a meeting I had at Thonon, with the chiefs
of the malcontents to talk of their affairs, and where they showed me
a sketch of their answer, I said not a word of mine, which was quite
ready, fearing obstacles might arise relative to the impression of it,
should the magistrate or my enemies hear of what I had done. This
work was, however known in France before the publication; but
government chose rather to let it appear, than to suffer me to guess
at the means by which my secret had been discovered. Concerning
this I will state what I know, which is but trifling: what I have
conjectured shall remain with myself.
I received, at Motiers, almost as many visits as at the Hermitage
and Montmorency; but these, for the most part were a different kind.
They who had formerly come to see me were people who, having
taste, talents, and principles, something similar to mine, alleged
them as the causes of their visits, and introduced subjects on which I
could converse. At Motiers the case was different, especially with the
visitors who came from France. They were officers or other persons
who had no taste for literature, nor had many of them read my
works, although, according to their own accounts, they had travelled
thirty, forty, sixty, and even a hundred leagues to come and see me,
and admire the illustrious man, the very celebrated, the great man,
etc. For from the time of my settling at Motiers, I received the most
impudent flattery, from which the esteem of those with whom I
associated had formerly sheltered me. As but few of my new visitors
deigned to tell me who or what they were, and as they had neither
read nor cast their eye over my works, nor had their researches and

mine been directed to the same objects, I knew not what to speak to
them upon: I waited for what they had to say, because it was for
them to know and tell me the purpose of their visit. It will naturally be
imagined this did not produce conversations very interesting to me,
although they, perhaps, were so to my visitors, according to the
information they might wish to acquire; for as I was without
suspicion, I answered without reserve, to every question they
thought proper to ask me, and they commonly went away as well
informed as myself of the particulars of my situation.
I was, for example, visited in this manner by M. de Feins, equerry
to the queen, and captain of cavalry, who had the patience to pass
several days at Motiers, and to follow me on foot even to La Ferriere,
leading his horse by the bridle, without having with me any point of
union, except our acquaintance with Mademoiselle Fel, and that we
both played at 'bilboquet'. [A kind of cup and ball.]
Before this I had received another visit much more extraordinary.
Two men arrived on foot, each leading a mule loaded with his little
baggage, lodging at the inn, taking care of their mules and asking to
see me. By the equipage of these muleteers they were taken for
smugglers, and the news that smugglers were come to see me was
instantly spread. Their manner of addressing me sufficiently showed
they were persons of another description; but without being
smugglers they might be adventurers, and this doubt kept me for
some time on my guard. They soon removed my apprehensions.
One was M. de Montauban, who had the title of Comte de la Tour du
Pin, gentleman to the dauphin; the other, M. Dastier de Carpentras,
an old officer who had his cross of St. Louis in his pocket, because
he could not display it. These gentlemen, both very amiable, were
men of sense, and their manner of travelling, so much to my own
taste, and but little like that of French gentlemen, in some measure
gained them my attachment, which an intercourse with them served
to improve. Our acquaintance did not end with the visit; it is still kept
up, and they have since been several times to see me, not on foot,
that was very well for the first time; but the more I have seen of these
gentlemen the less similarity have I found between their taste and
mine; I have not discovered their maxims to be such as I have ever
observed, that my writings are familiar to them, or that there is any

real sympathy between them and myself. What, therefore, did they
want with me? Why came they to see me with such an equipage?
Why repeat their visit? Why were they so desirous of having me for
their host? I did not at that time propose to myself these questions;
but they have sometimes occurred to me since.
Won by their advances, my heart abandoned itself without
reserve, especially to M. Dastier, with whose open countenance I
was more particularly pleased. I even corresponded with him, and
when I determined to print the 'Letters from the Mountains', I thought
of addressing myself to him, to deceive those by whom my packet
was waited for upon the road to Holland. He had spoken to me a
good deal, and perhaps purposely, upon the liberty of the press at
Avignon; he offered me his services should I have anything to print
there: I took advantage of the offer and sent him successively by the
post my first sheets. After having kept these for some time, he sent
them back to me, "Because," said he, "no bookseller dared to sell
them;" and I was obliged to have recourse to Rey taking care to
send my papers, one after the other, and not to part with those which
succeeded until I had advice of the reception of those already sent.
Before the work was published, I found it had been seen in the office
of the ministers, and D'Escherny, of Neuchatel, spoke to me of the
book, entitled 'Del' Homme de la Monlagne', which D'Holbach had
told him was by me. I assured him, and it was true, that I never had
written a book which bore that title. When the letters appeared he
became furious, and accused me of falsehood; although I had told
him truth. By this means I was certain my manuscript had been read;
as I could not doubt the fidelity of Rey, the most rational conjecture
seemed to be, that my packets had been opened at the post-house.
Another acquaintance I made much about the same time, but
which was begun by letters, was that with M. Laliand of Nimes, who
wrote to me from Paris, begging I would send him my profile; he said
he was in want of it for my bust in marble, which Le Moine was
making for him to be placed in his library. If this was a pretence
invented to deceive me, it fully succeeded. I imagined that a man
who wished to have my bust in marble in his library had his head full
of my works, consequently of my principles, and that he loved me
because his mind was in unison with mine. It was natural this idea

should seduce me. I have since seen M. Laliand. I found him very
ready to render me many trifling services, and to concern himself in
my little affairs, but I have my doubts of his having, in the few books
he ever read, fallen upon any one of those I have written. I do not
know that he has a library, or that such a thing is of any use to him;
and for the bust he has a bad figure in plaster, by Le Moine, from
which has been engraved a hideous portrait that bears my name, as
if it bore to me some resemblance.
The only Frenchman who seemed to come to see me, on account
of my sentiments, and his taste for my works, was a young officer of
the regiment of Limousin, named Seguier de St. Brisson. He made a
figure in Paris, where he still perhaps distinguishes himself by his
pleasing talents and wit. He came once to Montmorency, the winter
which preceded my catastrophe. I was pleased with his vivacity. He
afterwards wrote to me at Motiers, and whether he wished to flatter
me, or that his head was turned with Emilius, he informed me he was
about to quit the service to live independently, and had begun to
learn the trade of a carpenter. He had an elder brother, a captain in
the same regiment, the favorite of the mother, who, a devotee to
excess, and directed by I know not what hypocrite, did not treat the
youngest son well, accusing him of irreligion, and what was still
worse, of the unpardonable crime of being connected with me.
These were the grievances, on account of which he was determined
to break with his mother, and adopt the manner of life of which I have
just spoken, all to play the part of the young Emilius. Alarmed at his
petulance, I immediately wrote to him, endeavoring to make him
change his resolution, and my exhortations were as strong as I could
make them. They had their effect. He returned to his duty, to his
mother, and took back the resignation he had given the colonel, who
had been prudent enough to make no use of it, that the young man
might have time to reflect upon what he had done. St. Brisson, cured
of these follies, was guilty of another less alarming, but, to me, not
less disagreeable than the rest: he became an author. He
successively published two or three pamphlets which announced a
man not devoid of talents, but I have not to reproach myself with
having encouraged him by my praises to continue to write.

Some time afterwards he came to see me, and we made together
a pilgrimage to the island of St. Pierre. During this journey I found
him different from what I saw of him at Montmorency. He had, in his
manner, something affected, which at first did not much disgust me,
although I have since thought of it to his disadvantage. He once
visited me at the hotel de St. Simon, as I passed through Paris on
my way to England. I learned there what he had not told me, that he
lived in the great world, and often visited Madam de Luxembourg.
Whilst I was at Trie, I never heard from him, nor did he so much as
make inquiry after me, by means of his relation Mademoiselle
Seguier, my neighbor. This lady never seemed favorably disposed
towards me. In a word, the infatuation of M. de St. Brisson ended
suddenly, like the connection of M. de Feins: but this man owed me
nothing, and the former was under obligations to me, unless the
follies I prevented him from committing were nothing more than
affectation; which might very possibly be the case.
I had visits from Geneva also. The Delucs, father and son,
successively chose me for their attendant in sickness. The father
was taken ill on the road, the son was already sick when he left
Geneva; they both came to my house. Ministers, relations,
hypocrites, and persons of every description came from Geneva and
Switzerland, not like those from France, to laugh at and admire me,
but to rebuke and catechise me. The only person amongst them,
who gave me pleasure, was Moultou, who passed with me three or
four days, and whom I wished to remain much longer; the most
persevering of all, the most obstinate, and who conquered me by
importunity, was a M. d'Ivernois, a merchant at Geneva, a French
refugee, and related to the attorney-general of Neuchatel. This man
came from Geneva to Motiers twice a year, on purpose to see me,
remained with me several days together from morning to night,
accompanied me in my walks, brought me a thousand little presents,
insinuated himself in spite of me into my confidence, and
intermeddled in all my affairs, notwithstanding there was not
between him and myself the least similarity of ideas, inclination,
sentiment, or knowledge. I do not believe he ever read a book of any
kind throughout, or that he knows upon what subject mine are
written. When I began to herbalize, he followed me in my botanical

rambles, without taste for that amusement, or having anything to say
to me or I to him. He had the patience to pass with me three days in
a public house at Goumoins, whence, by wearying him and making
him feel how much he wearied me, I was in hopes of driving him
away. I could not, however, shake his incredible perseverance, nor
by any means discover the motive of it.
Amongst these connections, made and continued by force, I must
not omit the only one that was agreeable to me, and in which my
heart was really interested: this was that I had with a young
Hungarian who came to live at Neuchatel, and from that place to
Motiers, a few months after I had taken up my residence there. He
was called by the people of the country the Baron de Sauttern, by
which name he had been recommended from Zurich. He was tall,
well made, had an agreeable countenance, and mild and social
qualities. He told everybody, and gave me also to understand that he
came to Neuchatel for no other purpose, than that of forming his
youth to virtue, by his intercourse with me. His physiognomy,
manner, and behavior, seemed well suited to his conversation, and I
should have thought I failed in one of the greatest duties had I turned
my back upon a young man in whom I perceived nothing but what
was amiable, and who sought my acquaintance from so respectable
a motive. My heart knows not how to connect itself by halves. He
soon acquired my friendship, and all my confidence, and we were
presently inseparable. He accompanied me in all my walks, and
become fond of them. I took him to the marechal, who received him
with the utmost kindness. As he was yet unable to explain himself in
French, he spoke and wrote to me in Latin, I answered in French,
and this mingling of the two languages did not make our
conversations either less smooth or lively. He spoke of his family, his
affairs, his adventures, and of the court of Vienna, with the domestic
details of which he seemed well acquainted. In fine, during two years
which we passed in the greatest intimacy, I found in him a mildness
of character proof against everything, manners not only polite but
elegant, great neatness of person, an extreme decency in his
conversation, in a word, all the marks of a man born and educated a
gentleman, and which rendered him in my eyes too estimable not to
make him dear to me.

At the time we were upon the most intimate and friendly terms, D'
Ivernois wrote to me from Geneva, putting me upon my guard
against the young Hungarian who had taken up his residence in my
neighborhood; telling me he was a spy whom the minister of France
had appointed to watch my proceedings. This information was of a
nature to alarm me the more, as everybody advised me to guard
against the machinations of persons who were employed to keep an
eye upon my actions, and to entice me into France for the purpose of
betraying me. To shut the mouths, once for all, of these foolish
advisers, I proposed to Sauttern, without giving him the least
intimation of the information I had received, a journey on foot to
Pontarlier, to which he consented. As soon as we arrived there I put
the letter from D'Ivernois into his hands, and after giving him an
ardent embrace, I said: "Sauttern has no need of a proof of my
confidence in him, but it is necessary I should prove to the public that
I know in whom to place it." This embrace was accompanied with a
pleasure which persecutors can neither feel themselves, nor take
away from the oppressed.
I will never believe Sauttern was a spy, nor that he betrayed me:
but I was deceived by him. When I opened to him my heart without
reserve, he constantly kept his own shut, and abused me by lies. He
invented I know not what kind of story, to prove to me his presence
was necessary in his own country. I exhorted him to return to it as
soon as possible. He setoff, and when I thought he was in Hungary, I
learned he was at Strasbourgh. This was not the first time he had
been there. He had caused some disorder in a family in that city; and
the husband knowing I received him in my house, wrote to me. I
used every effort to bring the young woman back to the paths of
virtue, and Sauttern to his duty.
When I thought they were perfectly detached from each other, they
renewed their acquaintance, and the husband had the complaisance
to receive the young man at his house; from that moment I had
nothing more to say. I found the pretended baron had imposed upon
me by a great number of lies. His name was not Sauttern, but
Sauttersheim. With respect to the title of baron, given him in
Switzerland, I could not reproach him with the impropriety, because
he had never taken it; but I have not a doubt of his being a

gentleman, and the marshal, who knew mankind, and had been in
Hungary, always considered and treated him as such.
He had no sooner left my neighborhood, than the girl at the inn
where he eat, at Motiers, declared herself with child by him. She was
so dirty a creature, and Sauttern, generally esteemed in the country
for his conduct and purity of morals, piqued himself so much upon
cleanliness, that everybody was shocked at this impudent
pretension. The most amiable women of the country, who had vainly
displayed to him their charms, were furious: I myself was almost
choked with indignation. I used every effort to get the tongue of this
impudent woman stopped, offering to pay all expenses, and to give
security for Sauttersheim. I wrote to him in the fullest persuasion, not
only that this pregnancy could not relate to him, but that it was
feigned, and the whole a machination of his enemies and mine. I
wished him to return and confound the strumpet, and those by whom
she was dictated to. The pusillanimity of his answer surprised me.
He wrote to the master of the parish to which the creature belonged,
and endeavored to stifle the matter. Perceiving this, I concerned
myself no more about it, but I was astonished that a man who could
stoop so low should have been sufficiently master of himself to
deceive me by his reserve in the closest familiarity.
From Strasbourgh, Sauttersheim went to seek his fortune in Paris,
and found there nothing but misery. He wrote to me acknowledging
his error. My compassion was excited by the recollection of our
former friendship, and I sent him a sum of money. The year
following, as I passed through Paris, I saw him much in the same
situation; but he was the intimate friend of M. de Laliand, and I could
not learn by what means he had formed this acquaintance, or
whether it was recent or of long standing. Two years afterwards
Sauttersheim returned to Strasbourgh, whence he wrote to me and
where he died. This, in a few words, is the history of our connection,
and what I know of his adventures; but while I mourn the fate of the
unhappy young man, I still, and ever shall, believe he was the son of
people of distinction, and the impropriety of his conduct was the
effect of the situations to which he was reduced.
Such were the connections and acquaintance I acquired at
Motiers. How many of these would have been necessary to

compensate the cruel losses I suffered at the same time.
The first of these was that of M. de Luxembourg, who, after having
been long tormented by the physicians, at length became their
victim, by being treated for the gout which they would not
acknowledge him to have, as for a disorder they thought they could
cure.
According to what La Roche, the confidential servant of Madam de
Luxembourg, wrote to me relative to what had happened, it is by this
cruel and memorable example that the miseries of greatness are to
be deplored.
The loss of this good nobleman afflicted me the more, as he was
the only real friend I had in France, and the mildness of his character
was such as to make me quite forget his rank, and attach myself to
him as his equal. Our connection was not broken off on account of
my having quitted the kingdom; he continued to write to me as usual.
I nevertheless thought I perceived that absence, or my misfortune,
had cooled his affection for me. It is difficult to a courtier to preserve
the same attachment to a person whom he knows to be in disgrace
with courts. I moreover suspected the great ascendancy Madam de
Luxembourg had over his mind, had been unfavorable to me, and
that she had taken advantage of our separation to injure me in his
esteem. For her part, notwithstanding a few affected marks of
regard, which daily became less frequent, she less concealed the
change in her friendship. She wrote to me four or five times into
Switzerland, after which she never wrote to me again, and nothing
but my prejudice, confidence and blindness, could have prevented
my discovering in her something more than a coolness towards me.
Guy the bookseller, partner with Duchesne, who, after I had left
Montmorency, frequently went to the hotel de Luxembourg, wrote to
me that my name was in the will of the marechal. There was nothing
in this either incredible or extraordinary, on which account I had no
doubt of the truth of the information. I deliberated within myself
whether or not I should receive the legacy. Everything well
considered, I determined to accept it, whatever it might be, and to do
that honor to the memory of an honest man, who, in a rank in which
friendship is seldom found, had had a real one for me. I had not this
duty to fulfill. I heard no more of the legacy, whether it were true or

false; and in truth I should have felt some pain in offending against
one of the great maxims of my system of morality, in profiting by
anything at the death of a person whom I had once held dear. During
the last illness of our friend Mussard, Leneips proposed to me to
take advantage of the grateful sense he expressed for our cares, to
insinuate to him dispositions in our favor. "Ah! my dear Leneips,"
said I, "let us not pollute by interested ideas the sad but sacred
duties we discharge towards our dying friend. I hope my name will
never be found in the testament of any person, at least not in that of
a friend." It was about this time that my lord marshal spoke to me of
his, of what he intended to do in it for me, and that I made him the
answer of which I have spoken in the first part of my memoirs.
My second loss, still more afflicting and irreparable, was that of the
best of women and mothers, who, already weighed down with years,
and overburthened with infirmities and misery, quitted this vale of
tears for the abode of the blessed, where the amiable remembrance
of the good we have done here below is the eternal reward of our
benevolence. Go, gentle and beneficent shade, to those of Fenelon,
Berneg, Catinat, and others, who in a more humble state have, like
them, opened their hearts to pure charity; go and taste of the fruit of
your own benevolence, and prepare for your son the place he hopes
to fill by your side. Happy in your misfortunes that Heaven, in putting
to them a period, has spared you the cruel spectacle of his! Fearing,
lest I should fill her heart with sorrow by the recital of my first
disasters, I had not written to her since my arrival in Switzerland; but
I wrote to M. de Conzie, to inquire after her situation, and it was from
him I learned she had ceased to alleviate the sufferings of the
afflicted, and that her own were at an end. I myself shall not suffer
long; but if I thought I should not see her again in the life to come,
my feeble imagination would less delight in the idea of the perfect
happiness I there hope to enjoy.
My third and last loss, for since that time I have not had a friend to
lose, was that of the lord marshal. He did not die but tired of serving
the ungratful, he left Neuchatel, and I have never seen him since. He
still lives, and will, I hope, survive me: he is alive, and thanks to him
all my attachments on earth are not destroyed. There is one man still
worthy of my friendship; for the real value of this consists more in

what we feel than in that which we inspire; but I have lost the
pleasure I enjoyed in his, and can rank him in the number of those
only whom I love, but with whom I am no longer connected. He went
to England to receive the pardon of the king, and acquired the
possession of the property which formerly had been confiscated. We
did not separate without an intention of again being united, the idea
of which seemed to give him as much pleasure as I received from it.
He determined to reside at Keith Hall, near Aberdeen, and I was to
join him as soon as he was settled there: but this project was too
flattering to my hopes to give me any of its success. He did not
remain in Scotland. The affectionate solicitations of the King of
Prussia induced him to return to Berlin, and the reason of my not
going to him there will presently appear.
Before this departure, foreseeing the storm which my enemies
began to raise against me, he of his own accord sent me letters of
naturalization, which seemed to be a certain means of preventing me
from being driven from the country. The community of the Convent of
Val de Travers followed the example of the governor, and gave me
letters of Communion, gratis, as they were the first. Thus, in every
respect, become a citizen, I was sheltered from legal expulsion, even
by the prince; but it has never been by legitimate means, that the
man who, of all others, has shown the greatest respect for the laws,
has been persecuted. I do not think I ought to enumerate, amongst
the number of my losses at this time, that of the Abbe Malby. Having
lived sometime at the house of his mother, I have been acquainted
with the abbe, but not very intimately, and I have reason to believe
the nature of his sentiments with respect to me changed after I
acquired a greater celebrity than he already had. But the first time I
discovered his insincerity was immediately after the publication of
the 'Letters from the Mountain'. A letter attributed to him, addressed
to Madam Saladin, was handed about in Geneva, in which he spoke
of this work as the seditious clamors of a furious demagogue.
The esteem I had for the Abbe Malby, and my great opinion of his
understanding, did not permit me to believe this extravagant letter
was written by him. I acted in this business with my usual candor. I
sent him a copy of the letter, informing him he was said to be the
author of it. He returned me no answer. This silence astonished me:

but what was my surprise when by a letter I received from Madam de
Chenonceaux, I learned the Abbe was really the author of that which
was attributed to him, and found himself greatly embarrassed by
mine. For even supposing for a moment that what he stated was
true, how could he justify so public an attack, wantonly made,
without obligation or necessity, for the sole purpose of overwhelming
in the midst of his greatest misfortunes, a man to whom he had
shown himself a well-wisher, and who had not done anything that
could excite his enmity? In a short time afterwards the 'Dialogues of
Phocion', in which I perceived nothing but a compilation, without
shame or restraint, from my writings, made their appearance.
In reading this book I perceived the author had not the least regard
for me, and that in future I must number him among my most bitter
enemies. I do not believe he has ever pardoned me for the Social
Contract, far superior to his abilities, or the Perpetual Peace; and I
am, besides, of opinion that the desire he expressed that I should
make an extract from the Abby de St. Pierre, proceeded from a
supposition in him that I should not acquit myself of it so well.
The further I advance in my narrative, the less order I feel myself
capable of observing. The agitation of the rest of my life has
deranged in my ideas the succession of events. These are too
numerous, confused, and disagreeable to be recited in due order.
The only strong impression they have left upon my mind is that of the
horrid mystery by which the cause of them is concealed, and of the
deplorable state to which they have reduced me. My narrative will in
future be irregular, and according to the events which, without order,
may occur to my recollection. I remember about the time to which I
refer, full of the idea of my confessions, I very imprudently spoke of
them to everybody, never imagining it could be the wish or interest,
much less within the power of any person whatsoever, to throw an
obstacle in the way of this undertaking, and had I suspected it, even
this would not have rendered me more discreet, as from the nature
of my disposition it is totally impossible for me to conceal either my
thoughts or feelings. The knowledge of this enterprise was, as far as
I can judge, the cause of the storm that was raised to drive me from
Switzerland, and deliver me into the hands of those by whom I might
be prevented from executing it.

I had another project in contemplation which was not looked upon
with a more favorable eye by those who were afraid of the first: this
was a general edition of my works. I thought this edition of them
necessary to ascertain what books, amongst those to which my
name was affixed, were really written by me, and to furnish the
public with the means of distinguishing them from the writings falsely
attributed to me by my enemies, to bring me to dishonor and
contempt. This was besides a simple and an honorable means of
insuring to myself a livelihood, and the only one that remained to me.
As I had renounced the profession of an author, my memoirs not
being of a nature to appear during my lifetime; as I no longer gained
a farthing in any manner whatsoever, and constantly lived at a
certain expense, I saw the end of my resources in that of the
produce of the last things I had written. This reason had induced me
to hasten the finishing of my Dictionary of Music, which still was
incomplete. I had received for it a hundred louis(guineas) and a life
annuity of three hundred livres; but a hundred louis could not last
long in the hands of a man who annually expended upwards of sixty,
and three-hundred livres (twelve guineas) a year was but a trifling
sum to one upon whom parasites and beggarly visitors lighted like a
swarm of flies.
A company of merchants from Neuchatel came to undertake the
general edition, and a printer or bookseller of the name of Reguillat,
from Lyons, thrust himself, I know not by what means, amongst them
to direct it. The agreement was made upon reasonable terms, and
sufficient to accomplish my object. I had in print and manuscript,
matter for six volumes in quarto. I moreover agreed to give my
assistance in bringing out the edition. The merchants were, on their
part, to pay me a thousand crowns (one hundred and twenty-five
pounds) down, and to assign me an annuity of sixteen hundred livres
(sixty-six pounds) for life.
The agreement was concluded but not signed, when the Letters
from the Mountain appeared. The terrible explosion caused by this
infernal work, and its abominable author, terrified the company, and
the undertaking was at an end.
I would compare the effect of this last production to that of the
Letter on French Music, had not that letter, while it brought upon me

hatred, and exposed me to danger, acquired me respect and
esteem. But after the appearance of the last work, it was a matter of
astonishment at Geneva and Versailles that such a monster as the
author of it should be suffered to exist. The little council, excited by
Resident de France, and directed by the attorney-general, made a
declaration against my work, by which, in the most severe terms, it
was declared to be unworthy of being burned by the hands of the
hangman, adding, with an address which bordered upon the
burlesque, there was no possibility of speaking of or answering it
without dishonor. I would here transcribe the curious. piece of
composition, but unfortunately I have it not by me. I ardently wish
some of my readers, animated by the zeal of truth and equity, would
read over the Letters from the Mountain: they will, I dare hope, feel
the stoical moderation which reigns throughout the whole, after all
the cruel outrages with which the author was loaded. But unable to
answer the abuse, because no part of it could be called by that name
nor to the reasons because these were unanswerable, my enemies
pretended to appear too much enraged to reply: and it is true, if they
took the invincible arguments it contains, for abuse, they must have
felt themselves roughly treated.
The remonstrating party, far from complaining of the odious
declaration, acted according to the spirit of it, and instead of making
a trophy of the Letters from the Mountain, which they veiled to make
them serve as a shield, were pusillanimous enough not to do justice
or honor to that work, written to defend them, and at their own
solicitation. They did not either quote or mention the letters, although
they tacitly drew from them all their arguments, and by exactly
following the advice with which they conclude, made them the sole
cause of their safety and triumph. They had imposed on me this
duty: I had fulfilled it, and unto the end had served their cause and
the country. I begged of them to abandon me, and in their quarrels to
think of nobody but themselves. They took me at my word, and I
concerned myself no more about their affairs, further than constantly
to exhort them to peace, not doubting, should they continue to be
obstinate, of their being crushed by France; this however did not
happen; I know the reason why it did not, but this is not the place to
explain what I mean.

The effect produced at Neuchatel by the Letters from the Mountain
was at first very mild. I sent a copy of them to M. de Montmollin, who
received it favorably, and read it without making any objection. He
was ill as well as myself; as soon as he recovered he came in a
friendly manner to see me, and conversed on general subjects. A
rumor was however begun; the book was burned I know not where.
From Geneva, Berne, and perhaps from Versailles, the
effervescence quickly passed to Neuchatel, and especially to Val de
Travers, where, before even the ministers had taken any apparent
Steps, an attempt was secretly made to stir up the people, I ought, I
dare assert, to have been beloved by the people of that country in
which I have lived, giving alms in abundance, not leaving about me
an indigent person without assistance, never refusing to do any
service in my power, and which was consistent with justice, making
myself perhaps too familiar with everybody, and avoiding, as far as it
was possible for me to do it, all distinction which might excite the
least jealousy. This, however, did not prevent the populace, secretly
stirred up against me, by I know not whom, from being by degrees
irritated against me, even to fury, nor from publicly insulting me, not
only in the country and upon the road, but in the street. Those to
whom I had rendered the greatest services became most irritated
against me, and even people who still continued to receive my
benefactions, not daring to appear, excited others, and seemed to
wish thus to be revenged of me for their humiliation, by the
obligations they were under for the favors I had conferred upon
them. Montmollin seemed to pay no attention to what was passing,
and did not yet come forward. But as the time of communion
approached, he came to advise me not to present myself at the holy
table, assuring me, however, he was not my enemy, and that he
would leave me undisturbed. I found this compliment whimsical
enough; it brought to my recollection the letter from Madam de
Boufflers, and I could not conceive to whom it could be a matter of
such importance whether I communicated or not. Considering this
condescension on my part as an act of cowardice, and moreover,
being unwilling to give to the people a new pretext under which they
might charge me with impiety, I refused the request of the minister,

and he went away dissatisfied, giving me to understand I should
repent of my obstinacy.
He could not of his own authority forbid me the communion: that of
the Consistory, by which I had been admitted to it, was necessary,
and as long as there was no objection from that body I might present
myself without the fear of being refused. Montmollin procured from
the Classe (the ministers) a commission to summon me to the
Consistory, there to give an account of the articles of my faith, and to
excommunicate me should I refuse to comply. This excommunication
could not be pronounced without the aid of the Consistory also, and
a majority of the voices. But the peasants, who under the appellation
of elders, composed this assembly, presided over and governed by
their minister, might naturally be expected to adopt his opinion,
especially in matters of the clergy, which they still less understood
than he did. I was therefore summoned, and I resolved to appear.
What a happy circumstance and triumph would this have been to
me could I have spoken, and had I, if I may so speak, had my pen in
my mouth! With what superiority, with what facility even, should I
have overthrown this poor minister in the midst of his six peasants!
The thirst after power having made the Protestant clergy forget all
the principles of the reformation, all I had to do to recall these to their
recollection and to reduce them to silence, was to make comments
upon my first 'Letters from the Mountain', upon which they had the
folly to animadvert.
My text was ready, and I had only to enlarge on it, and my
adversary was confounded. I should not have been weak enough to
remain on the defensive; it was easy to me to become an assailant
without his even perceiving it, or being able to shelter himself from
my attack. The contemptible priests of the Classe, equally careless
and ignorant, had of themselves placed me in the most favorable
situation I could desire to crush them at pleasure. But what of this? It
was necessary I should speak without hesitation, and find ideas, turn
of expression, and words at will, preserving a presence of mind, and
keeping myself collected, without once suffering even a momentary
confusion. For what could I hope, feeling as I did, my want of
aptitude to express myself with ease? I had been reduced to the
most mortifying silence at Geneva, before an assembly which was

favorable to me, and previously resolved to approve of everything I
should say. Here, on the contrary, I had to do with a cavalier who,
substituting cunning to knowledge, would spread for me a hundred
snares before I could perceive one of them, and was resolutely
determined to catch me in an error let the consequence be what it
would. The more I examined the situation in which I stood, the
greater danger I perceived myself exposed to, and feeling the
impossibility of successfully withdrawing from it, I thought of another
expedient. I meditated a discourse which I intended to pronounce
before the Consistory, to exempt myself from the necessity of
answering. The thing was easy. I wrote the discourse and began to
learn it by memory, with an inconceivable ardor. Theresa laughed at
hearing me mutter and incessantly repeat the same phrases, while
endeavoring to cram them into my head. I hoped, at length, to
remember what I had written: I knew the chatelain as an officer
attached to the service of the prince, would be present at the
Consistory, and that notwithstanding the manoeuvres and bottles of
Montmollin, most of the elders were well disposed towards me. I
had, moreover, in my favor, reason, truth, and justice, with the
protection of the king, the authority of the council of state, and the
good wishes of every real patriot, to whom the establishment of this
inquisition was threatening. In fine, everything contributed to
encourage me.
On the eve of the day appointed, I had my discourse by rote, and
recited it without missing a word. I had it in my head all night: in the
morning I had forgotten it. I hesitated at every word, thought myself
before the assembly, became confused, stammered, and lost my
presence of mind. In fine, when the time to make my appearance
was almost at hand, my courage totally failed me. I remained at
home and wrote to the Consistory, hastily stating my reasons, and
pleaded my disorder, which really, in the state to which apprehension
had reduced me, would scarcely have permitted me to stay out the
whole sitting.
The minister, embarrassed by my letter, adjourned the Consistory.
In the interval, he of himself, and by his creatures, made a thousand
efforts to seduce the elders, who, following the dictates of their
consciences, rather than those they received from him, did not vote

according to his wishes, or those of the class. Whatever power his
arguments drawn from his cellar might have over this kind of people,
he could not gain one of them, more than the two or three who were
already devoted to his will, and who were called his 'ames
damnees'.--[damned souls]--The officer of the prince, and the
Colonel Pury, who, in this affair, acted with great zeal, kept the rest to
their duty, and when Montmollin wished to proceed to
excommunication, his Consistory, by a majority of voices, flatly
refused to authorize him to do it. Thus reduced to the last expedient,
that of stirring up the people against me, he, his colleagues, and
other persons, set about it openly, and were so successful, that notwithstanding the strong and frequent rescripts of the king, and the
orders of the council of state, I was at length obliged to quit the
country, that I might not expose the officer of the king to be himself
assassinated while he protected me.
The recollection of the whole of this affair is so confused, that it is
impossible for me to reduce to or connect the circumstances of it. I
remember a kind of negotiation had been entered into with the class,
in which Montmollin was the mediator. He feigned to believe it was
feared I should, by my writings, disturb the peace of the country, in
which case, the liberty I had of writing would be blamed. He had
given me to understand that if I consented to lay down my pen, what
was past would be forgotten. I had already entered into this
engagement with myself, and did not hesitate in doing it with the
class, but conditionally and solely in matters of religion. He found
means to have a duplicate of the agreement upon some change
necessary to be made in it. The condition having been rejected by
the class; I demanded back the writing, which was returned to me,
but he kept the duplicate, pretending it was lost. After this, the
people, openly excited by the ministers, laughed at the rescripts of
the king, and the orders of the council of state, and shook off all
restraint. I was declaimed against from the pulpit, called antichrist,
and pursued in the country like a mad wolf. My Armenian dress
discovered me to the populace; of this I felt the cruel inconvenience,
but to quit it in such circumstances, appeared to me an act of
cowardice. I could not prevail upon myself to do it, and I quietly
walked through the country with my caffetan and fur bonnet in the

midst of the hootings of the dregs of the people, and sometimes
through a shower of stones. Several times as I passed before
houses, I heard those by whom they were inhabited call out: "Bring
me my gun that I may fire at him." As I did not on this account hasten
my pace, my calmness increased their fury, but they never went
further than threats, at least with respect to firearms.
During the fermentation I received from two circumstances the
most sensible pleasure. The first was my having it in my power to
prove my gratitude by means of the lord marshal. The honest part of
the inhabitants of Neuchatel, full of indignation at the treatment I
received, and the manoeuvres of which I was the victim, held the
ministers in execration, clearly perceiving they were obedient to a
foreign impulse, and the vile agents of people, who, in making them
act, kept themselves concealed; they were moreover afraid my case
would have dangerous consequences, and be made a precedent for
the purpose of establishing a real inquisition.
The magistrates, and especially M. Meuron, who had succeeded
M. d' Ivernois in the office of attorney-general, made every effort to
defend me. Colonel Pury, although a private individual, did more and
succeeded better. It was the colonel who found means to make
Montmollin submit in his Consistory, by keeping the elders to their
duty. He had credit, and employed it to stop the sedition; but he had
nothing more than the authority of the laws, and the aid of justice
and reason, to oppose to that of money and wine: the combat was
unequal, and in this point Montmollin was triumphant. However,
thankful for his zeal and cares, I wished to have it in my power to
make him a return of good offices, and in some measure discharge a
part of the obligations I was under to him. I knew he was very
desirous of being named a counsellor of state; but having displeased
the court by his conduct in the affair of the minister Petitpierre, he
was in disgrace with the prince and governor. I however undertook,
at all risks, to write to the lord marshal in his favor: I went so far as
even to mention the employment of which he was desirous, and my
application was so well received that, contrary to the expectations of
his most ardent well wishers, it was almost instantly conferred upon
him by the king. In this manner fate, which has constantly raised me
to too great an elevation, or plunged me into an abyss of adversity,

continued to toss me from one extreme to another, and whilst the
populace covered me with mud I was able to make a counsellor of
state.
The other pleasing circumstance was a visit I received from
Madam de Verdelin with her daughter, with whom she had been at
the baths of Bourbonne, whence they came to Motiers and stayed
with me two or three days. By her attention and cares, she at length
conquered my long repugnancy; and my heart, won by her
endearing manner, made her a return of all the friendship of which
she had long given me proofs. This journey made me extremely
sensible of her kindness: my situation rendered the consolations of
friendship highly necessary to support me under my sufferings. I was
afraid she would be too much affected by the insults I received from
the populace, and could have wished to conceal them from her that
her feelings might not be hurt, but this was impossible; and although
her presence was some check upon the insolent populace in our
walks, she saw enough of their brutality to enable her to judge of
what passed when I was alone. During the short residence she
made at Motiers, I was still attacked in my habitation. One morning
her chambermaid found my window blocked up with stones, which
had been thrown at it during the night. A very heavy bench placed in
the street by the side of the house, and strongly fastened down, was
taken up and reared against the door in such a manner as, had it not
been perceived from the window, to have knocked down the first
person who should have opened the door to go out. Madam de
Verdelin was acquainted with everything that passed; for, besides
what she herself was witness to, her confidential servant went into
many houses in the village, spoke to everybody, and was seen in
conversation with Montmollin. She did not, however, seem to pay the
least attention to that which happened to me, nor never mentioned
Montmollin nor any other person, and answered in a few words to
what I said to her of him. Persuaded that a residence in England
would be more agreeable to me than any other, she frequently spoke
of Mr. Hume who was then at Paris, of his friendship for me, and the
desire he had of being of service to me in his own country. It is time I
should say something of Hume.

He had acquired a great reputation in France amongst the
Encyclopedists by his essays on commerce and politics, and in the
last place by his history of the House of Stuart, the only one of his
writings of which I had read a part, in the translation of the Abbe
Prevot. For want of being acquainted with his other works, I was
persuaded, according to what I heard of him, that Mr. Hume joined a
very republican mind to the English Paradoxes in favor of luxury. In
this opinion I considered his whole apology of Charles I. as a prodigy
of impartiality, and I had as great an idea of his virtue as of his
genius. The desire of being acquainted with this great man, and of
obtaining his friendship, had greatly strengthened the inclination I felt
to go to England, induced by the solicitations of Madam de Boufflers,
the intimate friend of Hume. After my arrival in Switzerland, I
received from him, by means of this lady, a letter extremely flattering;
in which, to the highest encomiums on my genius, he subjoined a
pressing invitation to induce me to go to England, and the offer of all
his interest, and that of his friends, to make my residence there
agreeable. I found in the country to which I had retired, the lord
marshal, the countryman and friend of Hume, who confirmed my
good opinion of him, and from whom I learned a literary anecdote,
which did him great honor in the opinion of his lordship and had the
same effect in mine. Wallace, who had written against Hume upon
the subject of the population of the ancients, was absent whilst his
work was in the press. Hume took upon himself to examine the
proofs, and to do the needful to the edition. This manner of acting
was according to my way of thinking. I had sold at six sous (three
pence) a piece, the copies of a song written against myself. I was,
therefore, strongly prejudiced in favor of Hume, when Madam de
Verdelin came and mentioned the lively friendship he expressed for
me, and his anxiety to do me the honors of England; such was her
expression. She pressed me a good deal to take advantage of this
zeal and to write to him. As I had not naturally an inclination to
England, and did not intend to go there until the last extremity, I
refused to write or make any promise; but I left her at liberty to do
whatever she should think necessary to keep Mr. Hume favorably
disposed towards me. When she went from Motiers, she left me in

the persuasion, by everything she had said to me of that illustrious
man, that he was my friend, and she herself still more his.
After her departure, Montmollin carried on his manoeuvres with
more vigor, and the populace threw off all restraint. Yet I still
continued to walk quietly amidst the hootings of the vulgar; and a
taste for botany, which I had begun to contract with Doctor d'Ivernois,
making my rambling more amusing, I went through the country
herbalising, without being affected by the clamors of this scum of the
earth, whose fury was still augmented by my calmness. What
affected me most was, seeing families of my friends, or of persons
who gave themselves that name, openly join the league of my
persecutors; such as the D'Ivernois, without excepting the father and
brother of my Isabel le Boy de la Tour, a relation to the friend in
whose house I lodged, and Madam Girardier, her sister-in-law.
[This fatality had begun with my residence at, Yverdon; the
banneret
Roguin dying a year or two after my departure from that city, the
old papa Roguin had the candor to inform me with grief, as he
said,
that in he papers of his relation, proofs had been found of his
having been concerned in the conspiracy to expel me from
Yverdon and
the state of Berne. This clearly proved the conspiracy not to be,
as some people pretended to believe, an affair of hypocrisy
since
the banneret, far from being a devotee, carried materialism and
incredulity to intolerance and fanaticism. Besides, nobody at
Yverdon had shown me more constant attention, nor had so
prodigally
bestowed upon me praises and flattery as this banneret. He
faithfully followed the favorite plan of my persecutors.]
This Peter Boy was such a brute; so stupid, and behaved so
uncouthly, that, to prevent my mind from being disturbed, I took the
liberty to ridicule him; and after the manner of the 'Petit Prophete', I
wrote a pamphlet of a few pages, entitled, 'la Vision de Pierre de la

Montagne dit le Voyant,--[The vision of Peter of the Mountain called
the Seer.]--in which I found means to be diverting enough on the
miracles which then served as the great pretext for my persecution.
Du Peyrou had this scrap printed at Geneva, but its success in the
country was but moderate; the Neuchatelois with all their wit, taste
but weakly attic salt or pleasantry when these are a little refined.
In the midst of decrees and persecutions, the Genevese had
distinguished themselves by setting up a hue and cry with all their
might; and my friend Vernes amongst others, with an heroical
generosity, chose that moment precisely to publish against me
letters in which he pretended to prove I was not a Christian. These
letters, written with an air of self-sufficiency were not the better for it,
although it was positively said the celebrated Bonnet had given them
some correction: for this man, although a materialist, has an
intolerant orthodoxy the moment I am in question. There certainly
was nothing in this work which could tempt me to answer it; but
having an opportunity of saying a few words upon it in my 'Letters
from the Mountain', I inserted in them a short note sufficiently
expressive of disdain to render Vernes furious. He filled Geneva with
his furious exclamations, and D'Ivernois wrote me word he had quite
lost his senses. Sometime afterwards appeared an anonymous
sheet, which instead of ink seemed to be written with water of
Phelethon. In this letter I was accused of having exposed my
children in the streets, of taking about with me a soldier's trull, of
being worn out with debaucheries..., and other fine things of a like
nature. It was not difficult for me to discover the author. My first idea
on reading this libel, was to reduce to its real value everything the
world calls fame and reputation amongst men; seeing thus a man
who was never in a brothel in his life, and whose greatest defect was
in being as timid and shy as a virgin, treated as a frequenter of
places of that description; and in finding myself charged with
being......, I, who not only never had the least taint of such disorder,
but, according to the faculty, was so constructed as to make it almost
impossible for me to contract it. Everything well considered, I thought
I could not better refute this libel than by having it printed in the city
in which I longest resided, and with this intention I sent it to
Duchesne to print it as it was with an advertisement in which I

named M. Vernes and a few short notes by way of eclaircissement.
Not satisfied with printing it only, I sent copies to several persons,
and amongst others one copy to the Prince Louis of Wirtemberg,
who had made me polite advances and with whom I was in
correspondence. The prince, Du Peyrou, and others, seemed to
have their doubts about the author of the libel, and blamed me for
having named Vernes upon so slight a foundation. Their remarks
produced in me some scruples, and I wrote to Duchesne to suppress
the paper. Guy wrote to me he had suppressed it: this may or may
not be the case; I have been deceived on so many occasions that
there would be nothing extraordinary in my being so on this, and
from the time of which I speak, was so enveloped in profound
darkness that it was impossible for me to come at any kind of truth.
M. Vernes bore the imputation with a moderation more than
astonishing in a man who was supposed not to have deserved it,
and after the fury with which he was seized on former occasions. He
wrote me two or three letters in very guarded terms, with a view, as it
appeared to me, to endeavor by my answers to discover how far I
was certain of his being the author of the paper, and whether or not I
had any proofs against him. I wrote him two short answers, severe in
the sense, but politely expressed, and with which he was not
displeased. To his third letter, perceiving he wished to form with me a
kind of correspondence, I returned no answer, and he got D'Ivernois
to speak to me. Madam Cramer wrote to Du Peyrou, telling him she
was certain the libel was not by Vernes. This however, did not make
me change my opinion. But as it was possible I might be deceived,
and as it is certain that if I were, I owed Vernes an explicit reparation,
I sent him word by D'Ivernois that I would make him such a one as
he should think proper, provided he would name to me the real
author of the libel, or at least prove that he himself was not so. I went
further: feeling that, after all, were he not culpable, I had no right to
call upon him for proofs of any kind, I stated in a memoir of
considerable length, the reasons whence I had inferred my
conclusion, and determined to submit them to the judgment of an
arbitrator, against whom Vernes could not except. But few people
would guess the arbitrator of whom I made choice. I declared at the
end of the memoir, that if, after having examined it, and made such

inquiries as should seem necessary, the council pronounced M.
Vernes not to be the author of the libel, from that moment I should be
fully persuaded he was not, and would immediately go and throw
myself at his feet, and ask his pardon until I had obtained it. I can
say with the greatest truth that my ardent zeal for equity, the
uprightness and generosity of my heart, and my confidence in the
love of justice innate in every mind never appeared more fully and
perceptible than in this wise and interesting memoir, in which I took,
without hesitation, my most implacable enemies for arbitrators
between a calumniator and myself. I read to Du Peyrou what I had
written: he advised me to suppress it, and I did so. He wished me to
wait for the proofs Vernes promised, and I am still waiting for them:
he thought it best that I should in the meantime be silent, and I held
my tongue, and shall do so the rest of my life, censured as I am for
having brought against Vernes a heavy imputation, false and
unsupportable by proof, although I am still fully persuaded, nay, as
convinced as I am of my existence, that he is the author of the libel.
My memoir is in the hands of Du Peyrou. Should it ever be published
my reasons will be found in it, and the heart of Jean Jacques, with
which my contemporaries would not be acquainted, will I hope be
known.
I have now to proceed to my catastrophe at Motiers, and to my
departure from Val de Travers, after a residence of two years and a
half, and an eight months suffering with unshaken constancy of the
most unworthy treatment. It is impossible for me clearly to recollect
the circumstances of this disagreeable period, but a detail of them
will be found in a publication to that effect by Du Peyrou, of which I
shall hereafter have occasion to speak.
After the departure of Madam de Verdelin the fermentation
increased, and, notwithstanding the reiterated rescripts of the king,
the frequent orders of the council of state, and the cares of the
chatelain and magistrates of the place, the people, seriously
considering me as antichrist, and perceiving all their clamors to be of
no effect, seemed at length determined to proceed to violence;
stones were already thrown after me in the roads, but I was however
in general at too great a distance to receive any harm from them. At
last, in the night of the fair of Motiers, which is in the beginning of

September, I was attacked in my habitation in such a manner as to
endanger the lives of everybody in the house.
At midnight I heard a great noise in the gallery which ran along the
back part of the house. A shower of stones thrown against the
window and the door which opened to the gallery fell into it with so
much noise and violence, that my dog, which usually slept there, and
had begun to bark, ceased from fright, and ran into a corner gnawing
and scratching the planks to endeavor to make his escape. I
immediately rose, and was preparing to go from my chamber into the
kitchen, when a stone thrown by a vigorous arm crossed the latter,
after having broken the window, forced open the door of my
chamber, and fell at my feet, so that had I been a moment sooner
upon the floor I should have had the stone against my stomach. I
judged the noise had been made to bring me to the door, and the
stone thrown to receive me as I went out. I ran into the kitchen,
where I found Theresa, who also had risen, and was tremblingly
making her way to me as fast as she could. We placed ourselves
against the wall out of the direction of the window to avoid the
stones, and deliberate upon what was best to be done; for going out
to call assistance was the certain means of getting ourselves
knocked on the head. Fortunately the maid-servant of an old man
who lodged under me was waked by the noise, and got up and ran
to call the chatelain, whose house was next to mine. He jumped from
his bed, put on his robe de chambre, and instantly came to me with
the guard, which, on account of the fair, went the round that night,
and was just at hand. The chatelain was so alarmed at the sight of
the effects of what had happened that he turned pale and on seeing
the stones in the gallery, exclaimed, "Good God! here is a quarry!"
On examining below stairs, a door of a little court was found to have
been forced, and there was an appearance of an attempt having
been made to get into the house by the gallery. On inquiring the
reason why the guard had neither prevented nor perceived the
disturbance, it came out that the guards of Motiers had insisted upon
doing duty that night, although it was the turn of those of another
village.
The next day the chatelain sent his report to the council of state,
which two days afterwards sent an order to inquire into the affair, to

promise a reward and secrecy to those who should impeach such as
were guilty, and in the meantime to place, at the expense of the king,
guards about my house, and that of the chatelain, which joined to it.
The day after the disturbance, Colonel Pury, the Attorney-General
Meuron, the Chatelain Martinet, the Receiver Guyenet, the Treasurer
d'Ivernois and his father, in a word, every person of consequence in
the country, came to see me, and united their solicitations to
persuade me to yield to the storm and leave, at least for a time, a
place in which I could no longer live in safety nor with honor. I
perceived that even the chatelain was frightened at the fury of the
people, and apprehending it might extend to himself, would be glad
to see me depart as soon as possible, that he might no longer have
the trouble of protecting me there, and be able to quit the parish,
which he did after my departure. I therefore yielded to their
solicitations, and this with but little pain, for the hatred of the people
so afflicted my heart that I was no longer able to support it.
I had a choice of places to retire to. After Madam de Verdelin
returned to Paris, she had, in several letters, mentioned a Mr.
Walpole, whom she called my lord, who, having a strong desire to
serve me, proposed to me an asylum at one of his country houses,
of the situation of which she gave me the most agreeable
description; entering, relative to lodging and subsistence, into a
detail which proved she and Lord Walpole had held particular
consultations upon the project. My lord marshal had always advised
me to go to England or Scotland, and in case of my determining
upon the latter, offered me there an asylum. But he offered me
another at Potsdam, near to his person, and which tempted me more
than all the rest.
He had just communicated to me what the king had said to him
about my going there, which was a kind of invitation to me from that
monarch, and the Duchess of Saxe-Gotha depended so much upon
my taking the journey that she wrote to me desiring I should go to
see her in my way to the court of Prussia, and stay some time before
I proceeded farther; but I was so attached to Switzerland that I could
not resolve to quit it so long as it was possible for me to live there,
and I seized this opportunity to execute a project of which I had for

several months conceived the idea, and of which I have deferred
speaking, that I might not interrupt my narrative.
This project consisted in going to reside in the island of St. Peter,
an estate belonging to the Hospital of Berne, in the middle of the
lake of Bienne. In a pedestrian pilgrimage I had made the preceding
year with Du Peyrou we had visited this isle, with which I was so
much delighted that I had since that time incessantly thought of the
means of making it my place of residence. The greatest obstacle to
my wishes arose from the property of the island being vested in the
people of Berne, who three years before had driven me from
amongst them; and besides the mortification of returning to live with
people who had given me so unfavorable a reception, I had reason
to fear they would leave me no more at peace in the island than they
had done at Yverdon. I had consulted the lord marshal upon the
subject, who thinking as I did, that the people of Berne would be glad
to see me banished to the island, and to keep me there as a hostage
for the works I might be tempted to write, and sounded their
dispositions by means of M. Sturler, his old neighbor at Colombier.
M. Sturler addressed himself to the chiefs of the state, and,
according to their answer assured the marshal the Bernois, sorry for
their past behavior, wished to see me settled in the island of St.
Peter, and to leave me there at peace. As an additional precaution,
before I determined to reside there, I desired the Colonel Chaillet to
make new inquiries. He confirmed what I had already heard, and the
receiver of the island having obtained from his superiors permission
to lodge me in it, I thought I might without danger go to the house,
with the tactic consent of the sovereign and the proprietors; for I
could not expect the people of Berne would openly acknowledge the
injustice they had done me, and thus act contrary to the most
inviolable maxim of all sovereigns.
The island of St. Peter, called at Neuchatel the island of La Motte,
in the middle of the lake of Bienne, is half a league in, circumference;
but in this little space all the chief productions necessary to
subsistence are found. The island has fields, meadows, orchards,
woods, and vineyards, and all these, favored by variegated and
mountainous situations, form a distribution of the more agreeable, as
the parts, not being discovered all at once, are seen successively to

advantage, and make the island appear greater than it really is. A
very elevated terrace forms the western part of it, and commands
Gleresse and Neuverville. This terrace is planted with trees which
form a long alley, interrupted in the middle by a great saloon, in
which, during the vintage, the people from the neighboring shores
assemble and divert themselves. There is but one house in the
whole island, but that is very spacious and convenient, inhabited by
the receiver, and situated in a hollow by which it is sheltered from the
winds.
Five or six hundred paces to the south of the island of St. Peter is
another island, considerably less than the former, wild and
uncultivated, which appears to have been detached from the greater
island by storms: its gravelly soil produces nothing but willows and
persicaria, but there is in it a high hill well covered with greensward
and very pleasant. The form of the lake is an almost regular oval.
The banks, less rich than those of the lake of Geneva and
Neuchatel, form a beautiful decoration, especially towards the
western part, which is well peopled, and edged with vineyards at the
foot, of a chain of mountains, something like those of Cote-Rotie, but
which produce not such excellent wine. The bailiwick of St. John,
Neuveville, Berne, and Bienne, lie in a line from the south to the
north, to the extremity of the lake, the whole interspersed with very
agreeable villages.
Such was the asylum I had prepared for myself, and to which I
was determined to retire alter quitting Val de Travers.
[It may perhaps be necessary to remark that I left there an
enemy in
M. du Teneaux, mayor of Verrieres, not much esteemed in the
country,
but who has a brother, said to be an honest man, in the office of
M.
de St. Florentin. The mayor had been to see him sometime
before my
adventure. Little remarks of this kind, though of no
consequence,
in themselves, may lead to the discovery of many underhand

dealings.]
This choice was so agreeable to my peaceful inclinations, and my
solitary and indolent disposition, that I consider it as one of the
pleasing reveries of which I became the most passionately fond. I
thought I should in that island be more separated from men, more
sheltered from their outrages, and sooner forgotten by mankind: in a
word, more abandoned to the delightful pleasures of the inaction of a
contemplative life. I could have wished to have been confined in it in
such a manner as to have had no intercourse with mortals, and I
certainly took every measure I could imagine to relieve me from the
necessity of troubling my head about them.
The great question was that of subsistence, and by the dearness
of provisions, and the difficulty of carriage, this is expensive in the
island; the inhabitants are besides at the mercy of the receiver. This
difficulty was removed by an arrangement which Du Peyrou made
with me in becoming a substitute to the company which had
undertaken and abandoned my general edition. I gave him all the
materials necessary, and made the proper arrangement and
distribution. To the engagement between us I added that of giving
him the memoirs of my life, and made him the general depositary of
all my papers, under the express condition of making no use of them
until after my death, having it at heart quietly to end my days without
doing anything which should again bring me back to the recollection
of the public. The life annuity he undertook to pay me was sufficient
to my subsistence. My lord marshal having recovered all his
property, had offered me twelve hundred livres (fifty pounds) a year,
half of which I accepted. He wished to send me the principal, and
this I refused on account of the difficulty of placing it. He then sent
the amount to Du Peyrou, in whose hands it remained, and who
pays me the annuity according to the terms agreed upon with his
lordship. Adding therefore to the result of my agreement with Du
Peyrou, the annuity of the marshal, two-thirds of which were
reversible to Theresa after my death, and the annuity of three
hundred livres from Duchesne, I was assured of a genteel
subsistence for myself, and after me for Theresa, to whom I left
seven hundred livres (twenty-nine pounds) a year, from the annuities

paid me by Rey and the lord marshal; I had therefore no longer to
fear a want of bread. But it was ordained that honor should oblige
me to reject all these resources which fortune and my labors placed
within my reach, and that I should die as poor as I had lived. It will be
seen whether or not, without reducing myself to the last degree of
infamy, I could abide by the engagements which care has always
taken to render ignominious, by depriving me of every other resource
to force me to consent to my own dishonor. How was it possible
anybody could doubt of the choice I should make in such an
alternative? Others have judged of my heart by their own.
My mind at ease relative to subsistence was without care upon
every other subject. Although I left in the world the field open to my
enemies, there remained in the noble enthusiasm by which my
writings were dictated, and in the constant uniformity of my
principles, an evidence of the uprightness of my heart which
answered to that deducible from my conduct in favor of my natural
disposition. I had no need of any other defense against my
calumniators. They might under my name describe another man, but
it was impossible they should deceive such as were unwilling to be
imposed upon. I could have given them my whole life to animadvert
upon, with a certainty, notwithstanding all my faults and weaknesses,
and my want of aptitude to, support the lightest yoke, of their finding
me in every situation a just and good man, without bitterness, hatred,
or jealousy, ready to acknowledge my errors, and still more prompt
to forget the injuries I received from others; seeking all my happiness
in love, friendship, and affection and in everything carrying my
sincerity even to imprudence and the most incredible
disinterestedness.
I therefore in some measure took leave of the age in which I lived
and my contemporaries, and bade adieu to the world, with an
intention to confine myself for the rest of my days to that island; such
was my resolution, and it was there I hoped to execute the great
project of the indolent life to which I had until then consecrated the
little activity with which Heaven had endowed me. The island was to
become to me that of Papimanie, that happy country where the
inhabitants sleep:

Où l'on fait plus, où l'on fait nulle chose.
[Where they do more: where they do nothing.]
This more was everything for me, for I never much regretted sleep;
indolence is sufficient to my happiness, and provided I do nothing, I
had rather dream waking than asleep. Being past the age of
romantic projects, and having been more stunned than flattered by
the trumpet of fame, my only hope was that of living at ease, and
constantly at leisure. This is the life of the blessed in the world to
come, and for the rest of mine here below I made it my supreme
happiness.
They who reproach me with so many contradictions, will not fail
here to add another to the number. I have observed the indolence of
great companies made them unsupportable to me, and I am now
seeking solitude for the sole purpose of abandoning myself to
inaction. This however is my disposition; if there be in it a
contradiction, it proceeds from nature and not from me; but there is
so little that it is precisely on that account that I am always
consistent. The indolence of company is burdensome because it is
forced. That of solitude is charming because it is free, and depends
upon the will. In company I suffer cruelly by inaction, because this is
of necessity. I must there remain nailed to my chair, or stand upright
like a picket, without stirring hand or foot, not daring to run, jump,
sing, exclaim, nor gesticulate when I please, not allowed even to
dream, suffering at the same time the fatigue of inaction and all the
torment of constraint; obliged to pay attention to every foolish thing
uttered, and to all the idle compliments paid, and constantly to keep
my mind upon the rack that I may not fail to introduce in my turn my
jest or my lie. And this is called idleness! It is the labor of a galley
slave.
The indolence I love is not that of a lazy fellow who sits with his
arms across in total inaction, and thinks no more than he acts, but
that of a child which is incessantly in motion doing nothing, and that
of a dotard who wanders from his subject. I love to amuse myself
with trifles, by beginning a hundred things and never finishing one of
them, by going or coming as I take either into my head, by changing

my project at every instant, by following a fly through all its windings,
in wishing to overturn a rock to see what is under it, by undertaking
with ardor the work of ten years, and abandoning it without regret at
the end of ten minutes; finally, in musing from morning until night
without order or coherence, and in following in everything the caprice
of a moment.
Botany, such as I have always considered it, and of which after my
own manner I began to become passionately fond, was precisely an
idle study, proper to fill up the void of my leisure, without leaving
room for the delirium of imagination or the weariness of total
inaction. Carelessly wandering in the woods and the country,
mechanically gathering here a flower and there a branch; eating my
morsel almost by chance, observing a thousand and a thousand
times the same things, and always with the same interest, because I
always forgot them, were to me the means of passing an eternity
without a weary moment. However elegant, admirable, and
variegated the structure of plants may be, it does not strike an
ignorant eye sufficiently to fix the attention. The constant analogy,
with, at the same time, the prodigious variety which reigns in their
conformation, gives pleasure to those only who have already some
idea of the vegetable system. Others at the sight of these treasures
of nature feel nothing more than a stupid and monotonous
admiration. They see nothing in detail because they know not for
what to look, nor do they perceive the whole, having no idea of the
chain of connection and combinations which overwhelms with its
wonders the mind of the observer. I was arrived at that happy point
of knowledge, and my want of memory was such as constantly to
keep me there, that I knew little enough to make the whole new to
me, and yet everything that was necessary to make me sensible to
the beauties of all the parts. The different soils into which the island,
although little, was divided, offered a sufficient variety of plants, for
the study and amusement of my whole life. I was determined not to
leave a blade of grass without analyzing it, and I began already to
take measures for making, with an immense collection of
observations, the 'Flora Petrinsularis'.
I sent for Theresa, who brought with her my books and effects. We
boarded with the receiver of the island. His wife had sisters at Nidau,

who by turns came to see her, and were company for Theresa. I
here made the experiment of the agreeable life which I could have
wished to continue to the end of my days, and the pleasure I found in
it only served to make me feel to a greater degree the bitterness of
that by which it was shortly to be succeeded.
I have ever been passionately fond of water, and the sight of it
throws me into a delightful reverie, although frequently without a
determinate object.
Immediately after I rose from my bed I never failed, if the weather
was fine, to run to the terrace to respire the fresh and salubrious air
of the morning, and glide my eye over the horizon of the lake,
bounded by banks and mountains, delightful to the view. I know no
homage more worthy of the divinity than the silent admiration excited
by the contemplation of his works, and which is not externally
expressed. I can easily comprehend the reason why the inhabitants
of great cities, who see nothing but walls, and streets, have but little
faith; but not whence it happens that people in the country, and
especially such as live in solitude, can possibly be without it. How
comes it to pass that these do not a hundred times a day elevate
their minds in ecstasy to the Author of the wonders which strike their
senses. For my part, it is especially at rising, wearied by a want of
sleep, that long habit inclines me to this elevation which imposes not
the fatigue of thinking. But to this effect my eyes must be struck with
the ravishing beauties of nature. In my chamber I pray less
frequently, and not so fervently; but at the view of a fine landscape I
feel myself moved, but by what I am unable to tell. I have
somewhere read of a wise bishop who in a visit to his diocese found
an old woman whose only prayer consisted in the single interjection
"Oh!"--"Good mother," said he to her, "continue to pray in this
manner; your prayer is better than ours." This better prayer is mine
also.
After breakfast, I hastened, with a frown on my brow, to write a few
pitiful letters, longing ardently for the moment after which I should
have no more to write. I busied myself for a few minutes about my
books and papers, to unpack and arrange them, rather than to read
what they contained; and this arrangement, which to me became the
work of Penelope, gave me the pleasure of musing for a while. I then

grew weary, and quitted my books to spend the three or four hours
which remained to me of the morning in the study of botany, and
especially of the system of Linnaeus, of which I became so
passionately fond, that, after having felt how useless my attachment
to it was, I yet could not entirely shake it off. This great observer is,
in my opinion, the only one who, with Ludwig, has hitherto
considered botany as a naturalist, and a philosopher; but he has too
much studied it in herbals and gardens, and not sufficiently in nature
herself. For my part, whose garden was always the whole island, the
moment I wanted to make or verify an observation, I ran into the
woods or meadows with my book under my arm, and there laid
myself upon the ground near the plant in question, to examine it at
my ease as it stood. This method was of great service to me in
gaining a knowledge of vegetables in their natural state, before they
had been cultivated and changed in their nature by the hands of
men. Fagon, first physician to Louis XIV., and who named and
perfectly knew all the plants in the royal garden, is said to have been
so ignorant in the country as not to know how to distinguish the
same plants. I am precisely the contrary. I know something of the
work of nature, but nothing of that of the gardener.
I gave every afternoon totally up to my indolent and careless
disposition, and to following without regularity the impulse of the
moment. When the weather was calm, I frequently went immediately
after I rose from dinner, and alone got into the boat. The receiver had
taught me to row with one oar; I rowed out into the middle of the
lake. The moment I withdrew from the bank, I felt a secret joy which
almost made me leap, and of which it is impossible for me to tell or
even comprehend the cause, if it were not a secret congratulation on
my being out of the reach of the wicked. I afterwards rowed about
the lake, sometimes approaching the opposite bank, but never
touching at it. I often let my boat float at the mercy of the wind and
water, abandoning myself to reveries without object, and which were
not the less agreeable for their stupidity. I sometimes exclaimed, "O
nature! O my mother! I am here under thy guardianship alone; here
is no deceitful and cunning mortal to interfere between thee and me."
In this manner I withdrew half a league from land; I could have
wished the lake had been the ocean. However, to please my poor

dog, who was not so fond as I was of such a long stay on the water, I
commonly followed one constant course; this was going to land at
the little island where I walked an hour or two, or laid myself down on
the grass on the summit of the hill, there to satiate myself with the
pleasure of admiring the lake and its environs, to examine and
dissect all the herbs within my reach, and, like another Robinson
Crusoe, built myself an imaginary place of residence in the island. I
became very much attached to this eminence. When I brought
Theresa, with the wife of the receiver and her sisters, to walk there,
how proud was I to be their pilot and guide! We took there rabbits to
stock it. This was another source of pleasure to Jean Jacques.
These animals rendered the island still more interesting to me. I
afterwards went to it more frequently, and with greater pleasure to
observe the progress of the new inhabitants.
To these amusements I added one which recalled to my
recollection the delightful life I led at the Charmettes, and to which
the season particularly invited me. This was assisting in the rustic
labors of gathering of roots and fruits, of which Theresa and I made it
a pleasure to partake with the wife of the receiver and his family. I
remember a Bernois, one M. Kirkeberguer, coming to see me, found
me perched upon a tree with a sack fastened to my waist, and
already so full of apples that I could not stir from the branch on which
I stood. I was not sorry to be caught in this and similar situations. I
hoped the people of Berne, witnesses to the employment of my
leisure, would no longer think of disturbing my tranquillity but leave
me at peace in my solitude. I should have preferred being confined
there by their desire: this would have rendered the continuation of
my repose more certain.
This is another declaration upon which I am previously certain of
the incredulity of many of my readers, who obstinately continue to
judge me by themselves, although they cannot but have seen, in the
course of my life, a thousand internal affections which bore no
resemblance to any of theirs. But what is still more extraordinary is,
that they refuse me every sentiment, good or indifferent, which they
have not, and are constantly ready to attribute to me such bad ones
as cannot enter into the heart of man: in this case they find it easy to
set me in opposition to nature, and to make of me such a monster as

cannot in reality exist. Nothing absurd appears to them incredible,
the moment it has a tendency to blacken me, and nothing in the least
extraordinary seems to them possible, if it tends to do me honor.
But, notwithstanding what they may think or say, I will still continue
faithfully to state what J. J. Rousseau was, did, and thought; without
explaining, or justifying, the singularity of his sentiments and ideas,
or endeavoring to discover whether or not others have thought as he
did. I became so delighted with the island of St. Peter, and my
residence there was so agreeable to me that, by concentrating all my
desires within it, I formed the wish that I might stay there to the end
of my life. The visits I had to return in the neighborhood, the journeys
I should be under the necessity of making to Neuchatel, Bienne,
Yverdon, and Nidau, already fatigued my imagination. A day passed
out of the island, seemed to me a loss of so much happiness, and to
go beyond the bounds of the lake was to go out of my element. Past
experience had besides rendered me apprehensive. The very
satisfaction that I received from anything whatever was sufficient to
make me fear the loss of it, and the ardent desire I had to end my
days in that island, was inseparable from the apprehension of being
obliged to leave it. I had contracted a habit of going in the evening to
sit upon the sandy shore, especially when the lake was agitated. I
felt a singular pleasure in seeing the waves break at my feet. I
formed of them in my imagination the image of the tumult of the
world contrasted with the peace of my habitation; and this pleasing
idea sometimes softened me even to tears. The repose I enjoyed
with ecstasy was disturbed by nothing but the fear of being deprived
of it, and this inquietude was accompanied with some bitterness. I
felt my situation so precarious as not to dare to depend upon its
continuance. "Ah! how willingly," said I to myself, "would I renounce
the liberty of quitting this place, for which I have no desire, for the
assurance of always remaining in it. Instead of being permitted to
stay here by favor, why am I not detained by force! They who suffer
me to remain may in a moment drive me away, and can I hope my
persecutors, seeing me happy, will leave me here to continue to be
so? Permitting me to live in the island is but a trifling favor. I could
wish to be condemned to do it, and constrained to remain here that I
may not be obliged to go elsewhere." I cast an envious eye upon

Micheli du Cret, who, quiet in the castle of Arbourg, had only to
determine to be happy to become so. In fine, by abandoning myself
to these reflections, and the alarming apprehensions of new storms
always ready to break over my head, I wished for them with an
incredible ardor, and that instead of suffering me to reside in the
island, the Bernois would give it me for a perpetual prison; and I can
assert that had it depended upon me to get myself condemned to
this, I would most joyfully have done it, preferring a thousand times
the necessity of passing my life there to the danger of being driven to
another place.
This fear did not long remain on my mind. When I least expected
what was to happen, I received a letter from the bailiff of Nidau,
within whose jurisdiction the island of St. Peter was; by his letter he
announced to me from their excellencies an order to quit the island
and their states. I thought myself in a dream. Nothing could be less
natural, reasonable, or foreseen than such an order: for I considered
my apprehensions as the result of inquietude in a man whose
imagination was disturbed by his misfortunes, and not to proceed
from a foresight which could have the least foundation. The
measures I had taken to insure myself the tacit consent of the
sovereign, the tranquillity with which I had been left to make my
establishment, the visits of several people from Berne, and that of
the bailiff himself, who had shown me such friendship and attention,
and the rigor of the season in which it was barbarous to expel a man
who was sickly and infirm, all these circumstances made me and
many people believe that there was some mistake in the order and
that ill-disposed people had purposely chosen the time of the vintage
and the vacation of the senate suddenly to do me an injury.
Had I yielded to the first impulse of my indignation, I should
immediately have departed. But to what place was I to go? What
was to become of me at the beginning of the winter, without object,
preparation, guide or carriage? Not to leave my papers and effects at
the mercy of the first comer, time was necessary to make proper
arrangements, and it was not stated in the order whether or not this
would be granted me. The continuance of misfortune began to weigh
down my courage. For the first time in my life I felt my natural
haughtiness stoop to the yoke of necessity, and, notwithstanding the

murmurs of my heart, I was obliged to demean myself by asking for
a delay. I applied to M. de Graffenried, who had sent me the order,
for an explanation of it. His letter, conceived in the strongest terms of
disapprobation of the step that had been taken, assured me it was
with the greatest regret he communicated to me the nature of it, and
the expressions of grief and esteem it contained seemed so many
gentle invitations to open to him my heart: I did so. I had no doubt
but my letter would open the eyes of my persecutors, and that if so
cruel an order was not revoked, at least a reasonable delay, perhaps
the whole winter, to make the necessary preparations for my retreat,
and to choose a place of abode, would be granted me.
Whilst I waited for an answer, I reflected upon my situation, and
deliberated upon the steps I had to take. I perceived so many
difficulties on all sides, the vexation I had suffered had so strongly
affected me, and my health was then in such a bad state, that I was
quite overcome, and the effect of my discouragement was to deprive
me of the little resource which remained in my mind, by which I
might, as well as it was possible to do it, have withdrawn myself from
my melancholy situation. In whatever asylum I should take refuge, it
appeared impossible to avoid either of the two means made use of
to expel me. One of which was to stir up against me the populace by
secret manoeuvres; and the other to drive me away by open force,
without giving a reason for so doing. I could not, therefore, depend
upon a safe retreat, unless I went in search of it farther than my
strength and the season seemed likely to permit. These
circumstances again bringing to my recollection the ideas which had
lately occurred to me, I wished my persecutors to condemn me to
perpetual imprisonment rather than oblige me incessantly to wander
upon the earth, by successively expelling me from the asylums of
which I should make choice: and to this effect I made them a
proposal. Two days after my first letter to M. de Graffenried, I wrote
him a second, desiring he would state what I had proposed to their
excellencies. The answer from Berne to both was an order,
conceived in the most formal and severe terms, to go out of the
island, and leave every territory, mediate and immediate of the
republic, within the space of twenty-four hours, and never to enter
them again under the most grievous penalties.

This was a terrible moment. I have since that time felt greater
anguish, but never have I been more embarrassed. What afflicted
me most was being forced to abandon the project which had made
me desirous to pass the winter in the island. It is now time I should
relate the fatal anecdote which completed my disasters, and involved
in my ruin an unfortunate people, whose rising virtues already
promised to equal those of Rome and Sparta, I had spoken of the
Corsicans in the 'Social Contract' as a new people, the only nation in
Europe not too worn out for legislation, and had expressed the great
hope there was of such a people, if it were fortunate enough to have
a wise legislator. My work was read by some of the Corsicans, who
were sensible of the honorable manner in which I had spoken of
them; and the necessity under which they found themselves of
endeavoring to establish their republic, made their chiefs think of
asking me for my ideas upon the subject. M. Buttafuoco, of one of
the first families in the country, and captain in France, in the Royal
Italians, wrote to me to that effect, and sent me several papers for
which I had asked to make myself acquainted with the history of the
nation and the state of the country. M. Paoli, also, wrote to me
several times, and although I felt such an undertaking to be superior
to my abilities; I thought I could not refuse to give my assistance to
so great and noble a work, the moment I should have acquired all
the necessary information. It was to this effect I answered both these
gentlemen, and the correspondence lasted until my departure.
Precisely at the same time, I heard that France was sending
troops to Corsica, and that she had entered into a treaty with the
Genoese. This treaty and sending of troops gave me uneasiness,
and, without imagining I had any further relation with the business, I
thought it impossible and the attempt ridiculous, to labor at an
undertaking which required such undisturbed tranquillity as the
political institution of a people in the moment when perhaps they
were upon the point of being subjugated. I did not conceal my fears
from M. Buttafuoco, who rather relieved me from them by the
assurance that, were there in the treaty things contrary to the liberty
of his country, a good citizen like himself would not remain as he did
in the service of France. In fact, his zeal for the legislation of the
Corsicans, and his connections with M. Paoli, could not leave a

doubt on my mind respecting him; and when I heard he made
frequent journeys to Versailles and Fontainebleau, and had
conversations with M. de Choiseul, all I concluded from the whole
was, that with respect to the real intentions of France he had
assurances which he gave me to understand, but concerning which
he did not choose openly to explain himself by letter.
This removed a part of my apprehensions. Yet, as I could not
comprehend the meaning of the transportation of troops from
France, nor reasonably suppose they were sent to Corsica to protect
the liberty of the inhabitants, which they of themselves were very
well able to defend against the Genoese, I could neither make
myself perfectly easy, nor seriously undertake the plan of the
proposed legislation, until I had solid proofs that the whole was
serious, and that the parties meant not to trifle with me. I much
wished for an interview with M. Buttafuoco, as that was certainly the
best means of coming at the explanation I wished. Of this he gave
me hopes, and I waited for it with the greatest impatience. I know not
whether he really intended me any interview or not; but had this even
been the case, my misfortunes would have prevented me from
profiting by it.
The more I considered the proposed undertaking, and the further I
advanced in the examination of the papers I had in my hands, the
greater I found the necessity of studying, in the country, the people
for whom institutions were to be made, the soil they inhabited, and
all the relative circumstances by which it was necessary to
appropriate to them that institution. I daily perceived more clearly the
impossibility of acquiring at a distance all the information necessary
to guide me. This I wrote to M. Buttafuoco, and he felt as I did.
Although I did not form the precise resolution of going to Corsica. I
considered a good deal of the means necessary to make that
voyage. I mentioned it to M. Dastier, who having formerly served in
the island under M. de Maillebois, was necessarily acquainted with it.
He used every effort to dissuade me from this intention, and I
confess the frightful description he gave me of the Corsicans and
their country, considerably abated the desire I had of going to live
amongst them.

But when the persecutions of Motiers made me think of quitting
Switzerland, this desire was again strengthened by the hope of at
length finding amongst these islanders the repose refused me in
every other place. One thing only alarmed me, which was my
unfitness for the active life to which I was going to be condemned,
and the aversion I had always had to it. My disposition, proper for
meditating at leisure and in solitude, was not so for speaking and
acting, and treating of affairs with men. Nature, which had endowed
me with the first talent, had refused me the last. Yet I felt that, even
without taking a direct and active part in public affairs, I should as
soon as I was in Corsica, be under the necessity of yielding to the
desires of the people, and of frequently conferring with the chiefs.
The object even of the voyage required that, instead of seeking
retirement, I should in the heart of the country endeavor to gain the
information of which I stood in need. It was certain that I should no
longer be master of my own time, and that, in spite of myself,
precipitated into the vortex in which I was not born to move, I should
there lead a life contrary to my inclination, and never appear but to
disadvantage. I foresaw that ill-supporting by my presence the
opinion my books might have given the Corsicans of my capacity, I
should lose my reputation amongst them, and, as much to their
prejudice as my own, be deprived of the confidence they had in me,
without which, however, I could not successfully produce the work
they expected from my pen. I am certain that, by thus going out of
my sphere, I should become useless to the inhabitants, and render
myself unhappy.
Tormented, beaten by storms from every quarter, and, for several
years past, fatigued by journeys and persecution, I strongly felt a
want of the repose of which my barbarous enemies wantonly
deprived me: I sighed more than ever after that delicious indolence,
that soft tranquillity of body and mind, which I had so much desired,
and to which, now that I had recovered from the chimeras of love
and friendship, my heart limited its supreme felicity. I viewed with
terror the work I was about to undertake; the tumultuous life into
which I was to enter made me tremble, and if the grandeur, beauty,
and utility of the object animated my courage, the impossibility of
conquering so many difficulties entirely deprived me of it.

Twenty years of profound meditation in solitude would have been
less painful to me than an active life of six months in the midst of
men and public affairs, with a certainty of not succeeding in my
undertaking.
I thought of an expedient which seemed proper to obviate every
difficulty. Pursued by the underhand dealings of my secret
persecutors to every place in which I took refuge, and seeing no
other except Corsica where I could in my old days hope for the
repose I had until then been everywhere deprived of, I resolved to go
there with the directions of M. Buttafuoco as soon as this was
possible, but to live there in tranquillity; renouncing, in appearance,
everything relative to legislation, and, in some measure, to make my
hosts a return for their hospitality, to confine myself to writing in the
country the history of the Corsicans, with a reserve in my own mind
of the intention of secretly acquiring the necessary information to
become more useful to them should I see a probability of success. In
this manner, by not entering into an engagement, I hoped to be
enabled better to meditate in secret and more at my ease, a plan
which might be useful to their purpose, and this without much
breaking in upon my dearly beloved solitude, or submitting to a kind
of life which I had ever found insupportable.
But the journey was not, in my situation, a thing so easy to get
over. According to what M. Dastier had told me of Corsica, I could
not expect to find there the most simple conveniences of life, except
such as I should take with me; linen, clothes, plate, kitchen furniture,
and books, all were to be conveyed thither. To get there myself with
my gouvernante, I had the Alps to cross, and in a journey of two
hundred leagues to drag after me all my baggage; I had also to pass
through the states of several sovereigns, and according to the
example set to all Europe, I had, after what had befallen me,
naturally to expect to find obstacles in every quarter, and that each
sovereign would think he did himself honor by overwhelming me with
some new insult, and violating in my person all the rights of persons
and humanity. The immense expense, fatigue, and risk of such a
journey made a previous consideration of them, and weighing every
difficulty, the first step necessary. The idea of being alone, and, at my
age, without resource, far removed from all my acquaintance, and at

the mercy of these semi-barbarous and ferocious people, such as M.
Dastier had described them to me, was sufficient to make me
deliberate before I resolved to expose myself to such dangers. I
ardently wished for the interview for which M. Buttafuoco had given
me reason to hope, and I waited the result of it to guide me in my
determination.
Whilst I thus hesitated came on the persecutions of Motiers, which
obliged me to retire. I was not prepared for a long journey, especially
to Corsica. I expected to hear from Buttafuoco; I took refuge in the
island of St. Peter, whence I was driven at the beginning of winter, as
I have already stated. The Alps, covered with snow, then rendered
my emigration impracticable, especially with the promptitude
required from me. It is true, the extravagant severity of a like order
rendered the execution of it almost impossible; for, in the midst of
that concentred solitude, surrounded by water, and having but
twenty-four hours after receiving the order to prepare for my
departure, and find a boat and carriages to get out of the island and
the territory, had I had wings, I should scarcely have been able to
pay obedience to it. This I wrote to the bailiff of Nidau, in answer to
his letter, and hastened to take my departure from a country of
iniquity. In this manner was I obliged to abandon my favorite project,
for which reason, not having in my oppression been able to prevail
upon my persecutors to dispose of me otherwise, I determined, in
consequence of the invitation of my lord marshal, upon a journey to
Berlin, leaving Theresa to pass the winter in the island of St. Peter,
with my books and effects, and depositing my papers in the hands of
M. du Peyrou. I used so much diligence that the next morning I left
the island and arrived at Bienne before noon. An accident, which I
cannot pass over in silence, had here well nigh put an end to my
journey.
As soon as the news or my having received an order to quit my
asylum was circulated, I received a great number of visits from the
neighborhood, and especially from the Bernois, who came with the
most detestable falsehood to flatter and soothe me, protesting that
my persecutors had seized the moment of the vacation of the senate
to obtain and send me the order, which, said they, had excited the
indignation of the two hundred. Some of these comforters came from

the city of Bienne, a little free state within that of Berne, and amongst
others a young man of the name of Wildremet whose family was of
the first rank, and had the greatest credit in that city. Wildremet
strongly solicited me in the name of his fellow-citizens to choose my
retreat amongst them, assuring me that they were anxiously
desirous of it, and that they would think it an honor and their duty to
make me forget the persecutions I had suffered; that with them I had
nothing to fear from the influence of the Bernois, that Bienne was a
free city, governed by its own laws, and that the citizens were
unanimously resolved not to hearken to any solicitation which should
be unfavorable to me.
Wildremet perceiving all he could say to be ineffectual, brought to
his aid several other persons, as well from Bienne and the environs
as from Berne; even, and amongst others, the same Kirkeberguer, of
whom I have spoken, who, after my retreat to Switzerland had
endeavored to obtain my esteem, and by his talents and principles
had interested me in his favor. But I received much less expected
and more weighty solicitations from M. Barthes, secretary to the
embassy from France, who came with Wildremet to see me,
exhorted me to accept his invitation, and surprised me by the lively
and tender concern he seemed to feel for my situation. I did not
know M. Barthes; however I perceived in what he said the warmth
and zeal of friendship, and that he had it at heart to persuade me to
fix my residence at Bienne. He made the most pompous eulogium of
the city and its inhabitants, with whom he showed himself so
intimately connected as to call them several times in my presence
his patrons and fathers.
This from Barthes bewildered me in my conjectures. I had always
suspected M. de Choisuel to be the secret author of all the
persecutions I suffered in Switzerland. The conduct of the resident of
Geneva, and that of the ambassador at Soleure but too much
confirmed my suspicion; I perceived the secret influence of France in
everything that happened to me at Berne, Geneva and Neuchatel,
and I did not think I had any powerful enemy in that kingdom, except
the Duke de Choiseul. What therefore could I think of the visit of
Barthes and the tender concern he showed for my welfare? My
misfortunes had not yet destroyed the confidence natural to my

heart, and I had still to learn from experience to discern snares under
the appearance of friendship. I sought with surprise the reason of the
benevolence of M. Barthes; I was not weak enough to believe he
had acted from himself; there was in his manner something
ostentatious, an affectation even which declared a concealed
intention, and I was far from having found in any of these little
subaltern agents, that generous intrepidity which, when I was in a
similar employment, had often caused a fermentation in my heart. I
had formerly known something of the Chevalier Beauteville, at the
castle of Montmorency; he had shown me marks of esteem; since
his appointment to the embassy he had given me proofs of his not
having entirely forgotten me, accompanied with an invitation to go
and see him at Soleure. Though I did not accept this invitation, I was
extremely sensible of his civility, not having been accustomed to be
treated with such kindness by people in place. I presume M. de
Beauteville, obliged to follow his instructions in what related to the
affairs of Geneva, yet pitying me under my misfortunes, had by his
private cares prepared for me the asylum of Bienne, that I might live
there in peace under his auspices. I was properly sensible of his
attention, but without wishing to profit by it and quite determined
upon the journey to Berlin, I sighed after the moment in which I was
to see my lord marshal, persuaded I should in future find zeal repose
and lasting happiness nowhere but near his person.
On my departure from the island, Kirkeberguer accompanied me
to Bienne. I found Wildremet and other Biennois, who, by the water
side, waited my getting out of the boat. We all dined together at the
inn, and on my arrival there my first care was to provide a chaise,
being determined to set off the next morning. Whilst we were at
dinner these gentlemen repeated their solicitations to prevail upon
me to stay with them, and this with such warmth and obliging
protestations, that notwithstanding all my resolutions, my heart,
which has never been able to resist friendly attentions, received an
impression from theirs; the moment they perceived I was shaken,
they redoubled their efforts with so much effect that I was at length
overcome, and consented to remain at Bienne, at least until the
spring.

Wildremet immediately set about providing me with a lodging, and
boasted, as of a fortunate discovery, of a dirty little chamber in the
back of the house, on the third story, looking into a courtyard, where
I had for a view the display of the stinking skins of a dresser of
chamois leather. My host was a man of a mean appearance, and a
good deal of a rascal; the next day after I went to his house I heard
that he was a debauchee, a gamester, and in bad credit in the
neighborhood. He had neither wife, children, nor servants, and shut
up in my solitary chamber, I was in the midst of one of the most
agreeable countries in Europe, lodged in a manner to make me die
of melancholy in the course of a few days. What affected me most
was, that, notwithstanding what I had heard of the anxious wish of
the inhabitants to receive me amongst them, I had not perceived, as
I passed through the streets, anything polite towards me in their
manners, or obliging in their looks. I was, however, determined to
remain there; but I learned, saw, and felt, the day after, that there
was in the city a terrible fermentation, of which I was the cause.
Several persons hastened obligingly to inform me that on the next
day I was to receive an order conceived in the most severe terms,
immediately to quit the state, that is the city. I had nobody in whom I
could confide; they who had detained me were dispersed. Wildremet
had disappeared; I heard no more of Barthes, and it did not appear
that his recommendation had brought me into great favor with those
whom he had styled his patrons and fathers. One M. de Van Travers,
a Bernois, who had an agreeable house not far from the city, offered
it to me for my asylum, hoping, as he said, that I might there avoid
being stoned. The advantage this offer held out was not sufficiently
flattering to tempt me to prolong my abode with these hospitable
people.
Yet, having lost three days by the delay, I had greatly exceeded
the twenty-four hours the Bernois had given me to quit their states,
and knowing their severity, I was not without apprehensions as to the
manner in which they would suffer me to cross them, when the bailiff
of Nidau came opportunely and relieved me from my
embarrassment. As he had highly disapproved of the violent
proceedings of their excellencies, he thought, in his generosity, he
owed me some public proof of his taking no part in them, and had

courage to leave his bailiwick to come and pay me a visit at Bienne.
He did me this favor the evening before my departure, and far from
being incognito he affected ceremony, coming in fiocchi in his coach
with his secretary, and brought me a passport in his own name that I
might cross the state of Berne at my ease, and without fear of
molestation. I was more flattered by the visit than by the passport,
and should have been as sensible of the merit of it, had it had for
object any other person whatsoever. Nothing makes a greater
impression on my heart than a well-timed act of courage in favor of
the weak unjustly oppressed.
At length, after having with difficulty procured a chaise, I next
morning left this barbarous country, before the arrival of the
deputation with which I was to be honored, and even before I had
seen Theresa, to whom I had written to come to me, when I thought I
should remain at Bienne, and whom I had scarcely time to
countermand by a short letter, informing her of my new disaster. In
the third part of my memoirs, if ever I be able to write them, I shall
state in what manner, thinking to set off for Berlin, I really took my
departure for England, and the means by which the two ladies who
wished to dispose of my person, after having by their manoeuvres
driven me from Switzerland, where I was not sufficiently in their
power, at last delivered me into the hands of their friend.
I added what follows on reading my memoirs to M. and Madam,
the Countess of Egmont, the Prince Pignatelli, the Marchioness of
Mesme, and the Marquis of Juigne.
I have written the truth: if any person has heard of things contrary
to those I have just stated, were they a thousand times proved, he
has heard calumny and falsehood; and if he refuses thoroughly to
examine and compare them with me whilst I am alive, he is not a
friend either to justice or truth. For my part, I openly, and without the
least fear declare, that whoever, even without having read my works,
shall have examined with his own eyes, my disposition, character,
manners, inclinations, pleasures, and habits, and pronounce me a
dishonest man, is himself one who deserves a gibbet.
Thus I concluded, and every person was silent; Madam d'Egmont
was the only person who seemed affected; she visibly trembled, but

soon recovered herself, and was silent like the rest of the company.
Such were the fruits of my reading and declaration.

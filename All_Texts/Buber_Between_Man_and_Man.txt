darkness. We meet them again in almost every system of that
widespread and manifold spiritual movement of gnosis, which
at that time seized the embarrassed heirs of the great oriental
and antique cultures, split the godhead and emptied value
from creation; and in the most consistent of these systems, in
Manichreism, there is even, consistently, a double earth. Here
man can no longer be a thing among things, and he can have
no fixed place in the world. Since he consists of soul and body
he is divided between the two kingdoms, he is simultaneously
the scene and the prize of the struggle. In each man the
original man who fell is manifested; in each man the problematic of being is stated in terms of life. Augustine emerged
from the school of Manichreism.
Homeless in the world,
solitary between the higher and the lower powers, he remains
homeless and solitary even after he found salvation in Christianity as a redemption that had already taken place. So he asks
Kant's question in the first person, and not, indeed, as with
Kant, as an objectivized problem, which the hearers of his
c-, logic lectures could certainly not understand as a question
directed to themselves; but he takes up the question of the
psalmist again in real address, with another sense and in
,,
Iv another tone: What is man that thou art mindful of him? He asks
for information from one who can give it: quid ergo sum, Deus
meits? quCEnatura mea? He does not mean only himsel ; the
war"'d natura 'saysclearly that in his person he means man, that
man whom he calls the grande profundum, the great mystery.
)(.
And he even draws that same anthropological conclusion
which we have heard in Malebranche; he does it in his famous
accusation of men, that they marvel at mountains, at the
waves of the sea and the course of the stars, but "relinquish"
themselves without ~ng
astonished at themselves. This
wonder of man at himself, which Augustine demands as a
result of his own self-experience, is something quite different
from the wonder with which Aristotle in his metaphysic makes
all philosophizing begin. The Aristotelian man wonders at
man among the rest, but only as a part of a quite astonishing
world. The Augustinian man wonders at that in man which
cannot be understood as a part of the world, as a thing among
things; and where that former wondering has already passed
into methodical philosophizing, the Augustinian wondering
manifests itself in its true depth and uncanniness. It is not
philosophy, but it affects all future philosophy.

In the post-augustinian west it is not the contemplation of
nature, as with the Greeks, but faith which builds a new house
in the cosmos for the solitary soul. The Christian cosmos
arises; and this was so real for every medireval Christian that
all who read the Divina Commedia made in spirit the journey to
the nethermost spiral of hell and stepped up over Lucifer's
back, through purgatory, to the heaven of the Trinity, not as
an expedition into lands as yet unknown, but as a crossing of
regions already fully mapped.
Once again there is a selfenclosed universe, once again· a house in which man is allowed
to dwell.
This universe is still more finite than that of
Aristotle, for here finite time too is taken into the image in all
seriousness-the finite time of the Bible, which here appears,
however, transformed into a Christian form. The pattern of
this image of the universe is a cross, whose vertical beam is
finite space from heaven to hell, leading right across the heart
of the human being, and whose cross-beam is finite time from
the creation of the world to the end of days; which makes
time's centre, the death of Christ, fall coveringly and redemptively on the centre of space, the heart of the poor sinner. The
medireval image of the universe is built round this pattern. In
it Dante painted life, the life of men and spirits, but the conceptual framework was set up for him by Thomas Aquinas.
As of Aristotle, so too it is true of Aquinas, though he was a
theologian, and therefore in duty bound to know about the
real man who says "I" and is addressed as "Thou", that man
speaks here "as it were always in the thir:d person".
In
Aquinas's world-system man is indeed a separate species of a
quite special kind, because in him the human soul, the lowest
of the spirits, is substantially united with the human body, the
highest of physical things, so that man appears as it were as
"the horizon and the dividing line of spiritual and physical
nature". But Aquinas knows no special problem and no special
problematic of human life, such as Augustine experienced and
expressed with trembling heart. The anthropological question
has here come to rest again; in man, housed and unproblematic,
no impulse stirs to questioning self-confrontation, or it is soon
appeased.

f

In the late middle ages there already emerged a new earnestness about man as man. The finite world still hedged man
safely in; hunc mundumhaud aliud esse,quam amplissimamquandam
hominis domum says Carolus Bovillus as late as the sixteenth
century. But the same Bovillus cries to man: homoes, sisterein
homine,and thus takes up the motif that had been expressed by
the great Gusa before him: homonon vult ess6nisi homo. This by
itself certainly does not imply that man by his nature steps
out of and forth from the world. For Cusa there is not a thing
which would not prefer its own being to all being and its own
way of being to all other ways of being; all that is wishes in
eternity to be nothing but itself, but to be this one thing always
more perfectly in the way proper to its nature; it is precisely
from this that the harmony of the universe grows, for every
being contains everything in a special "contraction".
But with man there is also thought, the reason which measures
and values. He has in himself all created things, like God; but
God has them in himself as the archetypes, man has them in
himself as relations and values. Cusa compares God to the
coining master of the mint, and man to the money-changer
with his scale of values. God can create all, we can know all;
we can know all because we too carry all in ourselves potentially. And soon after Cusa, Pico della Mirandola draws from
this proud self-assurance the a,nthropological conclusion,
which again reminds us of the words of Malebranche: nos
autem peculiare aliquid in homine quaerimus, unde et dignitas ei
propria et imago divinaesubstantiaecum nulla sibi creaturacommunis
comperiatur. Here the theme of anthropology already clearly
appears .. But it appears without that setting of the problematic
which is indispensable for the genuine establishment of
anthropology-the
deadly earnestness of the question about
man. Man steps forth here in such autonomy and such consciousness of power that the real question does not step up to
him. These thinkers of the Renaissance affirm that man c~n
know, but the Kantian question, what he can know, is still
quite foreign to them: he can know all. It is true that the last
in the series of these thinkers, Bovillus, excepts God: the human
spirit cannot reach God, but Bovillµs lets the whole universe
be known by man, who has been created outside it as its
spectator, in fact, as its eye. So securely are these pioneers of

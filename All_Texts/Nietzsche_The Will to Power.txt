A Note on This Edition
For the present volume I enlisted as a collaborator R. J. Hollingdale,
author of Nietzsche: The Man and His Philosophy (University of
Louisiana Press, 1965). I made a new translation of Book I, and he
furnished new translations of Books II, III, and IV, which I sub­
sequently corrected and revised very extensively, after comparing them
with the original German, sentence for sentence. I am also responsible
for the notes and the editorial apparatus—indeed, for the volume as a
whole.

1
is a very famous and interesting book, but
its stature and its reputation are two very different things. Indeed,
the nature and contents of the book are as little known as its title
is familiar. In a way this is odd because the book has been so
widely cited and discussed; but in the history of ideas one finds
perpetually that Hegel was right when he said in the preface to
his first book: “What is well-known is not necessarily known merely
because it is well-known.”
Two false views of The Will to Power have had their day, in
turn. The first was propagated by Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche, the
philosopher’s sister, when she first published the book after his
death: for a long time, it was widely held to represent Nietzsche’s
crowning systematic achievement, to which one had to turn for his
final views. Alfred Baumler began his postscript to the handy onevolume edition of the work (Kroner’s Taschenausgabe,1 vol. 78,
1930): “The Will to Power is Nietzsche’s philosophical magnum
opus. AH the fundamental results of his thinking are brought to­
gether in this book. The aversion of its author against systematizers
must not deter us from calling this work a system.” Philosophically,
B3umler was a nobody, but the editions of Nietzsche’s works for
which he wrote his postscripts were the most convenient and least
expensive and read very widely. Being a Nazi, Baumler was called
to Berlin as professor of philosophy after Hitler came to power.
His ideas about Nietzsche were accepted not only by large numbers
of Germans but also by many of Nietzsche’s detractors outside
Germany. Ernest Newman, for example, admits in the fourth
volume of his Life of Richard Wagner (1946) that his account
of Nietzsche relies heavily on Baumler’s “masterly epitome of
Nietzsche’s thinking, Nietzsche, Der Philosoph und Politiker”2
(p. 335).
After World War II this view of The Will to Power was dis­
t h e w il l to p o w e r

credited along with the Nazis; and in the process the book itself
was discredited, too. The gist of the new view was that The Will
to Power is not worth reading at all. The man who has done more
for this new myth than anyone else is Karl Schlechta, whose edi­
tion of Nietzsche’s works in three thin-paper volumes ( Werke in
drei Banden, 1954-1956) created something of an international
sensation— particularly the third volume with its odd handling of
The Will to Power and its lengthy “Philological Postscript.” A
passage from the postscript makes clear what is at stake: "The
Will to Power contains nothing new, nothing that could surprise
anyone who knows everything N published or intended to pub­
lish” (p. 1,403).
This is as untenable as Baumler’s view: the book contains
a good deal that has no close parallel in the works Nietzsche fin­
ished; for example, but by no means only, much of the material
on nihilism in Book I, some of the epistemological reflections in
Book III, and the attempts at proofs of the doctrine of the
eternal recurrence of the same events— and scores of brilliant
formulations. But Schlechta’s express view matters much less
than what he did to The Will to Power; and matters are further
complicated by the fact that what he did and what he said he
did are two different things.
He did away with the systematic arrangement of the older
editions and with the title The Will to Power and offered the
material in his third volume under the heading "A us dem Nachlass
der Achtzigerjahre," that is, “From the unpublished manuscript
material of the eighties.” And he claimed that his arrangement was
faithful to the manuscripts and chronological ( manuskriptgetreuchronologisch, p. 1,393), although in fact it is neither.
This question cannot be avoided here because it would be
unscholarly and perverse to reproduce the old systematic arrange­
ment in this translation if a far superior arrangement of the material
had been made available in 1956. But Schlechta’s arrangement is
utterly pointless, and indeed explicable only as an over-reaction
against the Baumler view: it represents an attempt to render The
Will to Power all but unreadable.
Suppose, first of all, Schlechta’s arrangement did follow the
manuscripts faithfully; even then it could not claim to be chrono­
logical. For as Schlechta himself notes in passing in his postscript
(p. 1,396), Nietzsche had the habit of using over and over old
notebooks that had not yet been completely filled, and of writing

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION

in them now from the front toward the back, now from the back
toward the front; and sometimes he filled right-hand pages only,
at other times left-hand pages only. And Erich Podach claims in
Ein Blick in Notizbiicher Nietzsche’s (“A Glance into Nietzsche’s
Notebooks,” 1963) that “Nietzsche as a rule used his notebooks
from back to front” (p. 8 ). Plainly, an arrangement that was
really faithful to the manuscripts would not be an arrangement at
all, but simply chaotic—and almost literally unreadable.
Moreover, Podach shows in the same book (pp. 202-206)
that Schlechta did not always follow the manuscripts (see my
notes on sections 2 and 124 below). Nor did Schlechta merely
fail to consult the manuscripts, using the printed text of the stand­
ard edition instead; he did not even make a point of consulting
the twenty-odd pages of notes at the end of the 1911 edition
where scores of departures from the manuscripts are registered.
Even if it is granted that by taking these departures into
account the present translation is philologically preferable to
Schlechta’s edition, it may seem odd that the old systematic
arrangement has been followed here once again. There are two
reasons for this. First, for all its faults, this arrangement has the
virtue of making it easy for the reader to locate passages and to
read straight through a lot of notes dealing with art or religion
or the theory of knowledge. Provided one realizes that one is
perusing notes and not a carefully wrought systematic work, the
advantages of such an arrangement outweigh the disadvantages.
But would it not have been possible to improve the systematic
arrangement? This brings us to the second reason for following
the old editions: there is something drastically wrong with schol­
arly translations that are not based on, do not correspond to, and
cannot be easily checked against any original. This translation
should be useful to scholars and critics, philosophers and historians,
professors and students; it should be possible to cite it and also
to find in it passages cited by others; and it should be easy to
compare the text with readily available German editions.

2
The question still remains to be answered: what is the nature
of this strange work? The answer is plain: it offers a selection
from Nietzsche’s notebooks of the years 1883 through 1888.
These notes were not intended for publication in this form, and

xvi

T H E W I L L TO P O WE R

the arrangement and the numbering are not Nietzsche’s. Alto­
gether, this book is not comparable to the works Nietzsche finished
and polished, and we do him a disservice if we fudge the distinction
between these hasty notes and his often gemlike aphorisms. Super­
ficially they may look alike, and the numbering contributes to
this appearance, but in both style and content the difference is
considerable.
To remind the reader of the difference, the approximate date
of composition is furnished in brackets after the number of each
note, and every attempt has been made to preserve the stylistic
character of the original. The temptation to complete sentences,
spruce up the punctuation, and turn jottings into attractive epi­
grams has been resisted with a will.3 And in my notes I have
called attention to passages in Nietzsche’s late books in which
some of these notes have been put to use— sometimes almost
literally, but often with an interesting and perhaps unexpected
twist. And in some notes I offer cross references to other passages
in which Nietzsche takes a different tack.
A generation ago, many readers might have felt that if this
book did not offer Nietzsche’s final system, it could surely be
ignored. But now that people have become used to reading the
notebooks of Gide, Kafka, and Camus, for example, without
taking them for anything but what they are, there is no need
to downgrade Nietzsche’s notes because they are mere notes. Of
course, the reason he did not use some of them in his later works,
although he could have included a lot of them quite easily in a
chapter of aphorisms in Twilight of the Idols, was that many of
them did not altogether satisfy him. Whether he used or did not
use them, these notes obviously do not represent his final views:
in his last active year, 1888, he completed five books; during the
immediately preceding two years, another two. So we clearly need
not turn to his notes to find what he really thought in the end.
But it is fascinating to look, as it were, into the workshop of a
great thinker; and Nietzsche’s notes need not fear comparison
with the notes of other great writers. On the contrary.
1Nietzsche often employs three or four periods as a punctuation mark
to indicate that a train of thought is not concluded. Since this device is so
regularly employed in English to indicate omissions, dashes (two if there are
a lot of periods) have been substituted in this translation to avoid misunder­
standing. And not all of Nietzsche's eccentricities have been retained; e.g.,
his frequent use of dashes before other punctuation marks. Also, I have
sometimes started new paragraphs where the German editors run on.

editor ’s introduction

The history of the text can be given briefly. Nietzsche himself
had contemplated a book under the title T h e W ill to Power . His
notebooks contain a great many drafts for title pages for this
and other projected works, and some of the drafts for this book
suggest as a subtitle: A tte m p t at a R evaluation o f A ll Values . Later
on Nietzsche considered writing a book of a somewhat different
nature (less aphoristic, more continuous) under the title R evalua­
tion o f all Values, and for a time he conceived of T he A ntichrist,
written in the fall of 1888, as the first of the four books com­
prising the R evaluation o f A ll Values.
In 1901, the year after Nietzsche’s death, his sister published
her first version of T h e W ill to Power in volume 15 of her edition
of his collected works, arranging 483 notes under topical headings.
In 1904 she included 200 pages of additional notes “from T h e
Will to Power” in the last volume of her biography of Nietzsche,
to help its sales* And in 1906 another edition of the collected
works offered a new version of T h e W ill to P ow er in two volumes:
the new material was mixed in with the old, and the total number
of notes now came to 1,067. In the so-called Grossoktav edition
of Nietzsche’s W erke the same 1,067 notes appear in volumes 15
and 16, and volume 16 (1911) also features an appendix which
contains “uncertain aphorisms and variants,” numbered 1,068
through 1,079; “plans, dispositions, drafts” (pp. 413-67); a post­
script (pp. 471-80); a list furnishing the numbers of the notebooks
in which each of the notes and drafts was found; and notes
indicating small departures from the manuscripts. I have made
abundant use of these notes in the pages that follow, sometimes
citing the volume in which they are found as “ 1911 ”4 For these
notes were not reprinted in the otherwise superior Musarion edi­
tion of Nietzsche’s W erke, in which T h e W ill to Power comprises
volumes 18 and 19. The other material found in 1911 is offered
in that edition, too, except that the list of the notebooks is super­
seded by a list giving the approximate date of composition of
each of the 1,067 notes. The dates given in the following pages in
brackets, immediately after the number of each note, are taken
from that list.

Where departures from the MSS are indicated in the editorial notes in
the following pages and no authority is cited, the information is derived
from 1911.

T H E W I L L TO P O WE R

The handiest edition of the work is probably the one-volume
edition in Kroner’s Taschen edition, volume 78, published in 1930
with Alfred Baumler’s postscript (discussed above). Kroner has
seen fit to reprint these Nietzsche editions, complete with Baum­
ler’s postscripts. On close examination, however, it appears that
some changes have been made in Baumler’s remarks about The
Will to Power, although this is not indicated anywhere. This edi­
tion contains none of the scholarly apparatus.
In 1940 Friedrich Wiirzbach published his own rearrangement
of the notes of The Will to Power, under the title “The Legacy
of Friedrich Nietzsche: Attempt at a new interpretation of all
that happens and a revaluation of all values, from the unpub­
lished manuscript material and arranged in accordance with
Nietzsche’s intentions.”5 The claim that these notes rather than
the books Nietzsche finished represent his legacy is as untenable
as the boast that this— or any— arrangement can claim the sanction
of Nietzsche’s own intentions. The bulk of Wiirzbach’s material
was taken from The Will to Power, but he also included some
other notes (all of them previously published in the Grossoktav
edition and the Musarion edition), and he amalgamated notes of
all periods, from 1870 to 1888. On pages 683-97 he furnished
the dates, but he nowhere indicated the numbers of the notes in
the standard edition of The Will to Power. This edition was trans­
lated into French but has won no acceptance in Germany or
among scholars elsewhere.
What needs to be said about the standard arrangement fol­
lowed in the present translation I said in my Nietzsche in 1950:
“To arrange the material, Frau Forster-Nietzsche chose a fourline draft left by her brother, and distributed the notes under its
four headings. Nietzsche himself had discarded this draft, and
there are a dozen later ones, about twenty-five in all; but none
of these were briefer than this one which listed only the titles of
the four projected parts and thus gave the editor the greatest pos­
sible freedom. (It was also the only draft which suggested “Zucht
und Zuchtung” as the title of Part IV, and Frau Forster-Nietzsche
may have been charmed by these words, although her brother, as
we shall see, did not consider ‘breeding’ a function of race.) His

own attempt to distribute some of his notes among the four parts
of a later and more detailed plan was ignored, as was the fact
that Nietzsche had abandoned the entire project of The Will to
Power in 1888. . , . Moreover, the Antichrist, however provoca­
tive, represents a more single-minded and sustained inquiry than
any of Nietzsche’s other books and thus suggests that the major
work of which it constitutes Part I [or at least was for a while
intended to form Part I] was not meant to consist of that maze
of incoherent, if extremely interesting, observations which have
since been represented as his crowning achievement. While he
intended to use some of this material, he evidently meant to mold
it into a coherent and continuous whole; and the manner in which
he utilized his notes in his other finished books makes it clear
that many notes would have been given an entirely new and
unexpected meaning*
“The publication of The Will to Power as Nietzsche’s final
and systematic work blurred the distinction between his works
and his notes and created the false impression that the aphorisms
in his books are of a kind with these disjointed jottings. Ever
since, The Will to Power, rather than the Gotzen-Dammerung
[Twilight of the Idols], Antichrist, and Ecce Homo, has been
searched for Nietzsche’s final position; and those who find it
strangely incoherent are led to conclude that the same must be
true a fortiori of his parva opera.
“The two most common forms of the Nietzsche legend can
thus be traced back to his sister. In the manner just indicated,
she unwittingly laid the foundation for the myth that Nietzsche’s
thought is hopelessly incoherent, ambiguous, and self-contradictory;
and by bringing to her interpretation of her brother’s work the
heritage of her late husband [a prominent anti-Semite whose
ideology Nietzsche had excoriated on many occasions], she pre­
pared the way for the belief that Nietzsche was a proto-Nazi”
(Prologue, section I ) .
Four years later, in 1954, when I published The Portable
Nietzsche and presented four complete works as well as selections
from Nietzsche’s other books, notes, and letters, all arranged in
chronological order, I included a few notes from The Will to
Power under such headings as “NOTES (1887)” with footnotes
reading: “Published as part of The Will to Power by Nietzsche’s
executors.”
Schlechta’s edition of 1956 thus did not require me to change

XX

T H E W I L L TO P O WE R

my mind about The Will to Power. But it may seem odd that in
the light of my own estimate of The Will to Power I should have
decided to publish a translation. The explanation is simple.
Nietzsche’s late works had to be made available first of all.
Toward that end I made entirely new translations of Thus Spoke
Zarathustra, Twilight of the Idols, The Antichrist, and Nietzsche
contra Wagner (all included in The Portable Nietzsche), and more
recently of Beyond Good and Evil (with commentary, 1966), The
Birth of Tragedy and The Case of Wagner (with commentary,
1967), and Ecce Homo (1967). And I collaborated on a new
translation of the Genealogy of Morals (1967). Beginning with
Zarathustra, then, all of Nietzsche’s later works will be available
in new translations. At that point The Will to Power should be
made accessible, too, for those who cannot read these notes in
the original German.
To be sure, there is an old translation, done by Anthony M.
Ludovici for The Complete Works of Friedrich Nietzsche, edited
by Dr. Oscar Levy. Originally published in 1914, the two volumes
of The Will to Power were “revised afresh by their translator” for
the edition of 1924, and reprinted without further revision in
1964. Dr. Levy was probably quite right when in a prefatory
note he called Ludovici “the most gifted and conscientious of my
collaborators,” but unfortunately this does not mean that Ludovici’s translations are roughly reliable. Even in the revised version,
the heading of section 12, for example, refers to “Cosmopolitan
Values” instead of “Cosmological Values.” Let us say that Ludo­
vici was not a philosopher, and let it go at that. It would be
pointless to multiply editorial notes in order to catalogue his mis­
translations. But as long as we shall never mention him in the
notes, one other example may be permissible. Section 86 begins:
"Your Henrik Ibsen has become very clear to me.” Evidently
confusing deutlich (clear) and deutsch, Ludovici renders this: “In
my opinion, Henrik Ibsen has become very German.”
4
On the surface, Nietzsche seems easy to read, at least by
comparison with other philosophers. In fact, however, his style
poses unusual difficulties, and anyone who has taken the trouble
to compare most of the existing translations with the originals
must realize how easy it is to miss Nietzsche’s meaning, not merely

editor ’s introduction

xxi

occasionally but in section upon section. The reasons are not diffi­
cult to find.
Nietzsche loved brevity to the point of ellipsis and often
attached exceptional weight to the nuances of the words he did
put down. Without an ear for the subtlest connotations of his
brilliant, sparkling German, one is bound to misunderstand him.
Nietzsche is Germany’s greatest prose stylist, and his language is a
delight at every turn like a poet's—more than that of all but
the very greatest poets.
A t the same time Nietzsche deals with intricate philosophical
questions, especially but not only in The Will to Power, and who­
ever lacks either a feeling for poetry or some knowledge of these
problems and their terminology is sure to come to grief in trying
to fathom Nietzsche, sentence for sentence, as a translator must.
Yet Nietzsche’s writings have an appeal that those of most
other philosophers— and of all other German philosophers—lack.
People turn to him for striking epigrams and brilliant formula­
tions; they remember phrases out of context; indeed, he is more
often than not read* out of context— casually, carelessly, as if the
details did not matter. If one turns to translations—whether the
old ones of The Complete Works or the more recent paperback
versions that flaunt their modernity— one usually falls victim to
translators who have read him that way.
In addition to all this, Nietzsche writes as a “good European”
(his coinage), alluding freely to Greek and Roman, French, Italian,
and German literature and history, and he uses foreign phrases
when they have nuances that might easily be lost in German. If
we simply rendered all such phrases into English, not only subtle
shades of meaning would be lost but—infinitely more important
— something of this European flavor. If we simply left them all
in the original, most students would be stumped by them; hence
I have offered English translations in footnotes, with apologies
to those who do not need them. Occasionally, no English equiva­
lents are offered because the meaning seems so obvious, usually
because the words are almost the same in English.
Similarly, some of the men referred to are identified in notes.
In all such matters compromises seem unavoidable: to identify
all would be insufferable, to identify none would leave even some
scholars baffled, and no mean could answer every student's needs
without at the same time striking some others as superfluous.
Precisely the same consideration applies to all other notes.

xxii

T H E W I L L TO P O WE R

Listing ali parallel passages at every point would swell the editorial
notes beyond all reason: after all, there are many indices to
Nietzsche's collected works (three different ones by Richard
Oehler— for the Grossoktav edition, the Musarion edition, and
Kroner’s Taschen edition— and one by Karl Schlechta for his
edition, as well as one in English for The Collected Works6), and
my recent translations furnish indices for individual works. More­
over, cross references and indices always do harm as well as good,
especially in Nietzsche’s case: there is no substitute for reading
his main works straight through, giving attention to the movement
of his thought and to the context in which various things are
said. But if no passages were cited in which Nietzsche put to use
the notes his sister published posthumously in The Will to Power,
the following pages would be as misleading as all previous editions,
English and German.
As it is, this translation oilers a great deal of information
not to be found in any German edition, though it owes a great
deal to the editorial apparatus of the Grossoktav edition and a
little to that of the Musarion edition. It should facilitate a better
understanding of Nietzsche, of the nineteenth century, and perhaps
also of some of the problems with which he dealt— and therefore
of the twentieth century, too.
5
Even in this introduction Nietzsche should have the last
word. So I shall conclude by citing one of his drafts for a preface
— not included in any previous edition of The Will to Power,
but found in the Musarion edition of the works (volume XIV,
pp. 373 /.) :
Fall of 1885
THE WILL TO POWER
A book for thinking, nothing else: it belongs to those for
whom thinking is a delight, nothing else—
That it is written in German is untimely, to say the
least: I wish I had written it in French so that it might not
appear to be a confirmation of the aspirations of the German
Reich.
' All five are incomplete even as far as names are concerned and omit
some of the most crucial passages in which terms that are listed appear.

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION

xxiii

The Germans of today are no thinkers any longer:
something else delights and impresses them.
The will to power as a principle might be intelligible
to them.
It is precisely among the Germans today that people
think less than anywhere else. But who knows? In two gen­
erations one will no longer require the sacrifice involved in
any nationalistic squandering of power and in becoming
stupid.
(Formerly I wished I had not written my Zarathustra in
German.)

When Jason Epstein talked me into doing more Nietzsche transla­
tions, and I talked him into doing The Will to Power, I did not
foresee that this volume would present even a fraction of the
difficulties that it did raise. At one point I abandoned the project
altogether, but Jason Epstein was ever patient and kind, and
Berenice Hoffman’s innumerable editorial queries were more than
patient and, like Jason Epstein’s persistence, never annoying. To
say that they were helpful would be an understatement. No trans­
lator or author could ask for more cooperation from his editors.
Further, I am indebted to Professor Dr. Hahn at the Goetheand Schiller-Archiv, Nationale Forschungs- und Gedenkstatten der
klassischen deutschen Literatur in Weimar, East Germany, for
sending me the reproductions of Nietzsche manuscripts that appear
at the front of this volume, and for granting me permission to pub­
lish them. These pictures have not been published previously and
contain passages that have never before appeared in print in any
language.

Friedrich Nietzsche.

L e ip z ig

Druck und Verlag von C. G. Naumann
1901.

In English: “Works Not Published by Nietzsche. The Will to
Power. Attempt at a Revaluation of All Values. (Studies and
Fragments.) By Friedrich Nietzsche.” The facing left page was
headed “Nietzsche’s Werke” and subtitled “Zweite Abtheilung.
Band XV. (Siebenter Band der zweiten Abtheilung.)” The first
eight volumes, comprising the first section of the works, contained
Nietzsche’s books; the second section, of which this was the
seventh volume, offered his Nachlass.
The editors were Peter Gast, Ernst Horneffer, and August
Horneffer. On the last page of her preface, Nietzsche’s sister wrote:
“But I emphasize expressly that I myself am not the editor of
this volume but at most a collaborator in the most modest sense
of that word. The only circumstance that permits me to write
this preface is that the collected edition of my brother’s works is
published at my behest, and hence the heaviest part of the responsi­
bility, with all its cares and fights, has been resting on my shoulders
for many years now. This 15th volume is to be considered as the

culmination of the perennial, troublesome, conscientious labors
of the editors: Peter Gast, Ernst and August Horneffer . .
483 sections (490 pages) plus 23 pages of Nietzsche’s plans,
and another 23 pages of editorial notes. The editors did not have
time to do the job as they themselves felt it ought to be done,
because Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche, as head of the NietzscheArchive, insisted that the volume be published in a huriy. There
were recriminations between her and the brothers Horneffer, and
they left the Archive.
The second edition of 1906, in the so-called Taschen edition
of the Werke (for the different editions of the works in German
see the bibliography at the end of my translation of The Birth
of Tragedy and The Case of Wagner in one volume, Vintage
Books, New York 1967), followed roughly the same plan as the
first edition but comprised 1,067 sections. Peter Gast checked all
the material against Nietzsche’s manuscripts, which he is said to
have been able to decipher better than anyone else, and he seems
to have had a fairly free hand in Books I and III.
The reprint of 1911 (in vols. XV and XVI of the revised
edition of the Grossoktav edition) follows the text of 1906, but
Dr. Otto Weiss contributed an appendix of invaluable scholarly
notes on the manuscripts.
In the so-called Musarion edition (23 vols., 1920-29), pub­
lished by the Musarion Verlag in Munich, the text of 1906 and
1911, which had been published by Kroner in Leipzig, is reprinted
in vols. XVIII and XIX, but the apparatus differs in two impor­
tant respects from the edition of 1911: on the basis of the informa­
tion given by Dr. Weiss on p. 480 ff, a table is included that
furnishes the approximate date of composition for every one of
the 1,067 sections; and the editorial notes listing departures from
the manuscripts are omitted. Indeed, these notes are found only
in the edition of 1911, and the list of dates appears only in the
Musarion edition. These two editions are therefore the most
scholarly and helpful, that of 1911 being by far the best.
No subsequent edition has made any important scholarly
contribution. The editions of Baumler, Wiirzbach, and Schlechta
are discussed in the Editor’s Introduction to the present edition,
and the editorial notes contain many examples showing how
Schlechta’s edition is less faithful to the manuscripts than the
edition of 1911, notwithstanding his explicit claims which have
been widely taken on credit on both sides of the Atlantic.

e d itio n s OF The Will to Power

XXIX

Finally, it may be noted that Baumler’s first edition of Der
Wille zur Macht, in volume 78 of Kroners Taschen edition (1930)
presented the work as one of Nietzsche’s books: the title page
mentions no editors. In the reprint in Samtliche Werke in zwolf
Bdnden, 12 vols., Kroner, Stuttgart 1964-65, the text follows vol­
ume 78 with the same pagination, but the title page adds “Ausgewahlt und geordnet von Peter Gast unter Mitwirkung von Elisabeth
Forster-Nietzsche” (selected and arranged by Peter Gast with the
aid of Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche); and in a postscript (pp. 71115) to his editorial afterword (pp. 699-711— a slightly revised
version of the earlier afterword, though neither the publisher nor
Baumler calls attention to the fact that some changes have been
made) Alfred Baumler deals briefly with Karl Schlechta’s and
Erich Podach’s criticisms of the editing of Nietzsche’s Nachlass.

PREFACE
(Nov, 1887-March 1888)
l

Of what is great one must either be silent or speak with great­
ness. With greatness— that jneans cynically and with innocence*

2
What I relate is the history of the next two centuries. I
describe what is coming, what can no longer come differently:
the advent of nihilism. This history can be related even now; for
necessity itself is at work here. This future speaks even now in
a hundred signs, this destiny announces itself everywhere; for
this music of the future all ears are cocked even now. For some
time now, our whole European culture has been moving as toward
a catastrophe, with a tortured tension that is growing from decade
to decade: restlessly, violently, headlong, like a river that wants
to reach the end, that no longer reflects, that is afraid to reflect.
3
He that speaks here, conversely, has done nothing so far
but reflect: a philosopher and solitary by instinct, who has found
his advantage in standing aside and outside, in patience, in pro­
crastination, in staying behind; as a spirit of daring and experiment
that has already lost its way once in every labyrinth of the future;
as a soothsayer-bird spirit who looks back when relating what will
come; as the first perfect nihilist of Europe who, however, has
even now lived through the whole of nihilism, to the end, leaving
it behind, outside himself.
4
For one should make no mistake about the meaning of the
title that this gospel of the future wants to bear. “The Will to
Power: Attempt at a Revaluation of All Values”— in this formula­
tion a countermovement finds expression, regarding both principle
and task; a movement that in some future will take the place of
this perfect nihilism— but presupposes it, logically and psychologi­

4

PREFACE

cally, and certainly can come only after and out of it. For why
has the advent of nihilism become necessary? Because the values
we have had hitherto thus draw their final consequence; because
nihilism represents the ultimate logical conclusion of our great
values and ideals—because we must experience nihilism before
we can find out what value these “values” really had.— We re­
quire, sometime, new values.

BOOK ONE
-------<m >------EUROPEAN NIHILISM

1 ( 1885-1886)
Toward an Outline
1. Nihilism stands at the door: whence comes this uncanniest of all guests? Point of departure: it is an error to consider
“social distress” or “physiological degeneration” or, worse, corrup­
tion, as the cause of nihilism. Ours is the most decent and com­
passionate age. Distress, whether of the soul, body, or intellect,
cannot of itself give birth to nihilism (i.e., the radical repudiation
of value, meaning, and desirability). Such distress always permits
a variety of interpretations. Rather: it is in one particular interpre­
tation, the Christian-moral one, that nihilism is rooted.
2. The end of Christianity— at the hands of its own morality
(which cannot be replaced), which turns against the Christian
God (the sense of truthfulness, developed highly by Christianity,
is nauseated by the falseness and mendaciousness of all Christian
interpretations of the world and of history; rebound from “God
is truth” to the fanatical faith “All is false”; Buddhism of ac­
tion— ).
3. Skepticism regarding morality is what is decisive. The end
of the moral interpretation of the world, which no longer has any
sanction after it has tried to escape into some beyond, leads to
nihilism. “Everything lacks meaning” (the untenability of one inter­
pretation of the world, upon which a tremendous amount of energy
has been lavished, awakens the suspicion that all interpretations
of the world are false). Buddhistic tendency, yearning for Nothing.
(Indian Buddhism is not the culmination of a thoroughly moralistic
development; its nihilism is therefore full of morality that is not
overcome: existence as punishment, existence construed as error,

2 (Spring-Fall 1887)'
What does nihilism mean? That the highest values devaluate
themselves. The aim is lacking; “why?” finds no answer.
3 (Spring-Fall 1887)*
Radical nihilism is the conviction of an absolute untenability
of existence when it comes to the highest values one recognizes;
plus the realization that we lack the least right to posit a beyond
or an in-itself of things that might be “divine” or morality in­
carnate.
This realization is a consequence of the cultivation of “truth­
fulness”— thus itself a consequence of the faith in morality.
4 (June 10, 1887)*
What were the advantages of the Christian moral hypothesis?
1 . It granted man an absolute value, as opposed to his small­
ness and accidental occurrence in the flux of becoming and passing
away.

According to Erich Podach, notes 2, 13, 22, and 23 form a single note
in Nietzsche’s notebooks—not in that order. The note begins:
“Nihilism as a normal condition. Nihilism: the aim is lacking; 4why?*
finds no answer. What does nihilism mean? That the highest values de­
valuate themselves.
“It is ambiguous:
“A. Nihilism as a sign of increased power of the spirit: active
nihilism .

“It can be a sign of strength: . . .”

Rothe, 1963, pp. 205 /, In Schlechta’s edition the note appears in four parts,

2. It served the advocates of God insofar as it conceded to
the world, in spite of suffering and evil, the character of perfec­
tion— including “freedom” : evil appeared full of meaning.
3. It posited that man had a knowledge of absolute values
and thus adequate knowledge precisely regarding what is most
important,
4. It prevented man from despising himself as man, from
taking sides against life; from despairing of knowledge: it was a
means of preservation.
In sum: morality was the great antidote against practical
and theoretical nihilism.
5 (June 10, 1887)*
But among the forces cultivated by morality was truthfulness:
this eventually turned against morality, discovered its teleology, its
partial perspective— and now the recognition of this inveterate
mendaciousness that one despairs of shedding becomes a stimulant.
Now we discover in ourselves needs implanted by centuries of
moral interpretation— needs that now appear to us as needs for
untruth; on the other hand, the value for which we endure life
seems to hinge on these needs. This antagonism— not to esteem
what we know, and not to be allowed any longer to esteem the lies
we should like to tell ourselves— results in a process of dissolution.

This is the antinomy:
Insofar as we believe in morality we pass sentence on exist­
ence.

The supreme values in whose service man should live, es­
pecially when they were very hard on him and exacted a high
price— these social values were erected over man to strengthen
their voice, as if they were commands of God, as “reality,” as the
“true” world, as a hope and future world. Now that the shabby
origin of these values is becoming clear, the universe seems to

have lost value, seems “meaningless”— but that is only a transi­
tional stage.
8 (1883-1888)
The nihilistic consequence (the belief in valuelessness) as a
consequence of moral valuation: everything egoistic has come to
disgust us (even though we realize the impossibility of the unegoistic); what is necessary has come to disgust us (even though
we realize the impossibility of any liberum arbitrium5 or “in­
telligible freedom” ). We see that we cannot reach the sphere in
which we have placed our values; but this does not by any means
confer any value on that other sphere in which we live: on the
contrary, we are weary because we have lost the main stimulus.

Decline of Cosmological Values
(A )
Nihilism as a psychological state will have to be reached,
first, when we have sought a “meaning” in all events that is not
there: so the seeker eventually becomes discouraged. Nihilism,
then, is the recognition of the long waste of strength, the agony
of the “in vain,” insecurity, the lack of any opportunity to recover
and to regain composure— being ashamed in front of oneself, as
if one had deceived oneself all too long.— This meaning could
have been: the “fulfillment” of some highest ethical canon in all
events, the moral world order; or the growth of love and harmony
in the intercourse of beings; or the gradual approximation of a
state of universal happiness; or even the development toward a
state of universal annihilation— any goal at least constitutes some
meaning. What all these notions have in common is that some­
thing is to be achieved through the process— and now one realizes
that becoming aims at nothing and achieves nothing.— Thus,
disappointment regarding an alleged aim of becoming as a cause
of nihilism: whether regarding a specific aim or, universalized, the
realization that all previous hypotheses about aims that concern
the whole “evolution” are inadequate (man no longer the col­
laborator, let alone the center, of becoming).
Nihilism as a psychological state is reached, secondly, when
one has posited a totality, a systematization, indeed any organiza­
tion in all events, and underneath all events, and a soul that longs
to admire and revere has wallowed in the idea of some supreme
form of domination and administration (— if the soul be that of
a logician, complete consistency and real dialectic are quite suf­
ficient to reconcile it to everything). Some sort of unity, some
form of “monism” : this faith suffices to give man a deep feeling of
standing in the context of, and being dependent on, some whole
that is infinitely superior to him, and he sees himself as a mode of
the deity.— “The well-being of the universal demands the devo­
tion of the individual”— but behold, there is no such universal!
At bottom, man has lost the faith in his own value when no in­
finitely valuable whole works through him; i.e., he conceived such
a whole in order to be able to believe in his own value.
Nihilism as psychological state has yet a third and last form.

b o o k ONE: European Nihilism

13

Given these two insights, that becoming has no goal and that
underneath all becoming there is no grand unity in which the
individual could immerse himself completely as in an element of
supreme value, an escape remains: to pass sentence on this whole
world of becoming as a deception and to invent a world beyond
it, a true world. But as soon as man finds out how that world is
fabricated solely from psychological needs, and how he has ab­
solutely no right to it, the last form of nihilism comes into being:
it includes disbelief in any metaphysical world and forbids itself
any belief in a true world.7 Having reached this standpoint, one
grants the reality of becoming as the only reality, forbids oneself
every kind of clandestine access to afterworlds and false divinities
—but cannot endure this world though one does not want to deny
it.
What has happened, at bottom? The feeling of valuelessness
was reached with the realization that the overall character of ex­
istence may not be interpreted by means of the concept of “aim,”
the concept of “unity,” or the concept of “truth.” Existence has
no goal or end; any comprehensive unity in the plurality of events
is lacking: the character of existence is not “true,” is false. One
simply lacks any reason for convincing oneself that there is a
true world. Briefly: the categories “aim,” “unity,” “being” which
we used to project some value into the world—we pull out again;
so the world looks valueless.
( ®)

Suppose we realize how the world may no longer be in­
terpreted in terms of these three categories, and that the world
begins to become valueless for us after this insight: then we have
to ask about the sources of our faith in these three categories. Let
us try if it is not possible to give up our faith in them. Once
we have devaluated these three categories, the demonstration that
they cannot be applied to the universe is no longer any reason for
devaluating the universe.
Conclusion: The faith in the categories of reason is the cause
of nihilism. We have measured the value of the world according
to categories that refer to a purely fictitious world.
Final conclusion: All the values by means of which we have

482-86).

T H E W I L L TO P O WE R

tried so far to render the world estimable for ourselves and which
then proved inapplicable and therefore devaluated the world— all
these values are, psychologically considered, the results of certain
perspectives of utility, designed to maintain and increase human
constructs of domination— and they have been falsely projected
into the essence of things. What we find here is still the hyperbolic
naivete of man: positing himself as the meaning and measure of
the value of things.
13 (Spring-Fall 1887) 8
Nihilism represents a pathological transitional stage (what is
pathological is the tremendous generalization, the inference that
there is no meaning at all): whether the productive forces are
not yet strong enough, or whether decadence still hesitates and
has not yet invented its remedies.
Presupposition of this hypothesis: that there is no truth, that
there is no absolute nature of things nor a “thing-in-itself.” This,
too, is merely nihilism—even the most extreme nihilism. It places
the value of things precisely in the lack of any reality corresponding
to these values and in their being merely a symptom of strength
on the part of the value-positers, a simplification for the sake of life.
14 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Values and their changes are related to increases in the
power of those positing the values.
The measure of unbelief, of permitted “freedom of the spirit”
as an expression of an increase in power.
“Nihilism” an ideal of the highest degree of powerfulness of
the spirit, the over-richest life— partly destructive, partly ironic.
15 (Spring-Fall 1887)
What is a belief? How does it originate? Every belief is a
considering-something-true.
The most extreme form of nihilism would be the view that
every belief, every considering-something-true, is necessarily false
because there simply is no true world. Thus: a perspectival ap*See the footnote for section 2 above.

pearance whose origin lies in us (in so far as we continually need
a narrower, abbreviated, simplified world),
—That it is the measure of strength to what extent we can
admit to ourselves, without perishing, the merely apparent char­
acter, the necessity of lies.
To this extent, nihilism, as the denial of a truthful world, of
being, might be a divine way of thinking.
16 {Nov. 1887-March 1888)
If we are “disappointed,” it is at least not regarding life:
rather we are now facing up to all kinds of “desiderata.” With
scornful wrath we contemplate what are called “ideals” ; we despise
ourselves only because there are moments when we cannot subdue
that absurd impulse that is called “idealism.” The influence of
too much coddling is stronger than the wrath of the disappointed.
17 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. 1888)
To what extent Schopenhauer’s nihilism still follows from
the same ideal that created Christian theism.— One felt so certain
about the highest desiderata, the highest values, the highest per­
fection that the philosophers assumed this as an absolute certainty,
as if it were a priori: “God” at the apex as a given truth. “To
become as God,” “to be absorbed into God”— for thousands of
years these were the most naive and convincing desiderata (but
what convinces is not necessarily true— it is merely convincing: a
note for asses).
One has unlearned the habit of conceding to this posited
ideal the reality of a person; one has become atheistic. But has
the ideal itself been renounced?— At bottom, the last metaphy­
sicians still seek in it true “reality,” the “thing-in-itself” compared
to which everything else is merely apparent. It is their dogma that
our apparent world, being so plainly not the expression of this
ideal, cannot be “true”— and that, at bottom, it does not even lead
us back to that metaphysical world as its cause. The unconditional,
representing that highest perfection, cannot possibly be the ground
of all that is conditional. Schopenhauer wanted it otherwise and
therefore had to conceive of this metaphysical ground as the
opposite of the ideal— as “evil, blind will” : that way it could be

16

T H E W I L L TO P O WE R

that “which appears,” that which reveals itself in the world of
appearances. But even so he did not renounce the absoluteness of
the ideal— he sneaked by.—
(Kant considered the hypothesis of ‘‘intelligible freedom”
necessary in order to acquit the ens perfectum0 of responsibility for
the world’s being such-and-such—in short, to account for evil
and ills: a scandalous bit of logic for a philosopher.— )
18 ( 1883-1888)
The most universal sign of the modern age: man has lost
dignity in his own eyes to an incredible extent. For a long time
the center and tragic hero of existence in general; then at least
intent on proving himself closely related to the decisive and es­
sentially valuable side of existence— like all metaphysicians who
wish to cling to the dignity of man, with their faith that moral
values are cardinal values. Those who have abandoned God cling
that much more firmly to the faith in morality.10
19 (1883-1888)
Every purely moral value system (that of Buddhism, for
example) ends in nihilism: this to be expected in Europe. One still
hopes to get along with a moralism without religious background:
but that necessarily leads to nihilism.— In religion the constraint
is lacking to consider ourselves as value-positing.
20 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The nihilistic question “for what?” is rooted in the old habit
of supposing that the goal must be put up, given, demanded from
outside—by some superhuman authority. Having unlearned faith
in that, one still follows the old habit and seeks another authority
that can speak unconditionally and command goals and tasks. The
authority of conscience now steps up front (the more emancipated
one is from theology, the more imperativistic morality becomes)
*Perfect being.

to compensate for the loss of a personal authority. Or the authority
of reason. Or the social instinct (the herd). Or history with an
immanent spirit and a goal within, so one can entrust oneself to it.
One wants to get around the will, the willing of a goal, the risk of
positing a goal for oneself; one wants to rid oneself of the re­
sponsibility (one would accept fatalism). Finally, happiness—and,
with a touch of Tartufle, the happiness of the greatest number.
One says to oneself:
1. a definite goal is not necessary at all,
2. cannot possibly be anticipated.
Just now when the greatest strength of will would be neces­
sary, it is weakest and least confident. Absolute mistrust regarding
the organizing strength of the will for the whole.11

become incommensurate (for a faith generally expresses the
constraint of conditions of existence, submission to the authority
of circumstances under which one flourishes, grows, gains power).
Or a sign of the lack of strength to posit for oneself, productively,
a goal, a why, a faith.
It reaches its maximum of relative strength as a violent
force of destruction— as active nihilism.
Its opposite: the weary nihilism that no longer attacks; its
most famous form, Buddhism; a passive nihilism, a sign of weak­
ness. The strength of the spirit may be worn out, exhausted, so
that previous goals and values have become incommensurate and
no longer are believed; so that the synthesis of values and goals
(on which every strong culture rests) dissolves and the individual
values war against each other: disintegration— and whatever re­
freshes, heals, calms, numbs emerges into the foreground in various
disguises, religious or moral, or political, or aesthetic, etc.
24 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
Nihilism does not only contemplate the “in vain!” nor is it
merely the belief that everything deserves to perish: one helps
to destroy.— This is, if you will, illogical; but the nihilist does
not believe that one needs to be logical.— It is the condition of
strong spirits and wills, and these do not find it possible to stop
with the No of “judgment” : their nature demands the No of the
deed. The reduction to nothing by judgment is seconded by the
reduction to nothing by hand.
25 (Spring-Fall 1887)
On the genesis of the nihilist.— It is only late that one
musters the courage for what one really knows.14 That I have
hitherto been a thorough-going nihilist, I have admitted to myself
only recently: the energy and radicalism with which I advanced
as a nihilist deceived me about this basic fact. When one moves
toward a goal it seems impossible that “goal-lessness as such” is
the principle of our faith.
“ This note was used in the second aphorism of Twilight of the Idols:
“Even the most courageous among us only rarely has the courage for that
which he really knows.”

The pessimism of active energy: the question “for what?”
after a terrible struggle, even victory. That something is a hun­
dred times more important than the question of whether we feel
well or not: basic instinct of all strong natures— and consequently
also whether others feel well or not. In sum, that we have a goal
for which one does not hesitate to offer human sacrifices, to risk
every danger, to take upon oneself whatever is bad and worst: the
great passion.
27 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Causes of nihilism: 1. The higher species is lacking, i.e.,
those whose inexhaustible fertility and power keep up the faith
in man. (One should recall what one owes to Napoleon: almost
all of the higher hopes of this century.)
2.
The lower species (“herd,” “mass,” “society”) unlearns
modesty and blows up its needs into cosmic and metaphysical
values. In this way the whole of existence is vulgarized: in so far
as the mass is dominant it bullies the exceptions, so they lose
their faith in themselves and become nihilists.
All attempts to think up higher types failed (“romanticism” ;
the artist, the philosopher; against Carlyle’s attempt to ascribe
to them the highest moral values).
The resistance to higher types as a result.
Decline and insecurity of all higher types. The fight against
the genius (“folk poetry,” etc.). Pity for the lowly and suffering
as a measure for the height of a soul.
The philosopher is lacking who interprets the deed and does
not merely transpose it.
28 {Spring-Fall 1887)
Main proposition. How complete nihilism is the necessary
consequence of the ideals entertained hitherto.15
Incomplete nihilism; its forms: we live in the midst of it.
Attempts to escape nihilism without revaluating our values
so far: they produce the opposite, make the problem more acute.

betters;
e. one still believes in good and evil and experiences the
triumph of the good and the annihilation of evil as a task (that

f. contempt for what is “natural,” for desire, for the ego:
attempt to understand even the highest spirituality and art as the

and give them a higher meaning: we still have the “Christian

There have been more thoughtful and thought-addicted ages
than ours: ages, e.g., like that in which the Buddha appeared,
when after centuries of quarrels among sects the people them­
selves were as deeply lost in the ravines of philosophic doctrines
as European nations were at times in the subtleties of religious
dogmas. Surely, one should not let “literature” and the press seduce
us to think well of the “spirit” of our time: the existence of millions
of spiritists and a Christianity that goes in for gymnastics of that
gruesome ugliness that characterizes all English inventions are
more instructive.
European pessimism is still in its early stages—bears witness
against itself: it still lacks that tremendous, yearning rigidity of
expression in which the Nothing is reflected, once found in India;
it is still far too contrived and too little “organic”—too much a
pessimism of scholars and poets: I mean, much of it is excogitated
and invented, is “created” and not a "cause.”

THE W I L L TO P O WE R

32 (Summer-Fall 1888)
Critique of pessimism to date.— Resistance to eudaemonistic
considerations as the last reduction to the question: what does
it mean? The reduction of growing gloom.—
Our pessimism: the world does not have the value we thought
it had. Our faith itself has so increased our desire for knowledge
that today we have to say this. Initial result: it seems worth less;
that is how it is experienced initially. It is only in this sense that
we are pessimists; i.e., in our determination to admit this revalua­
tion to ourselves without any reservation, and to stop telling our­
selves tales—lies— the old way.
That is precisely how we find the pathos that impels us to
seek new values. In sum: the world might be far more valuable
than we used to believe; we must see through the naivete of our
ideals, and while we thought that we accorded it the highest inter­
pretation, we may not even have given our human existence a
moderately fair value.
What has been deified? The value instincts in the community
(that which made possible its continued existence).
What has been slandered'} That which set apart the higher
men from the lower, the desires that create clefts.
33 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Causes of the advent of pessimism:
1. that the most powerful desires of life that have the most
future have hitherto been slandered, so a curse weighs on life;
2. that the growing courage and integrity and the bolder
mistrust that now characterize man comprehend that these instincts
are inseparable from life, and one therefore turns against life;

for this conflict, flourish while the higher kind miscarries and,
as a product of degeneration, invites antipathy— that the mediocre,
on the other hand, when they pose as the goal and meaning, arouse
indignation (that nobody is able any more to answer any “for
what?”);

and that the individual, faced with this tremendous machinery,
loses courage and submits.
34 ( 1885-1886)
Modem pessimism is an expression of the uselessness of the
modem world— not of the world of existence.
35 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The “predominance of suffering over pleasure” or the op­
posite (hedonism): these two doctrines are already signposts to
nihilism.
For in both of these cases no ultimate meaning is posited
except the appearance of pleasure or displeasure.
But that is how a kind of man speaks that no longer dares
to posit a will, a purpose, a meaning: for any healthier kind of
man the value of life is certainly not measured by the standard
of these trifles. And suffering might predominate, and in spite
of that a powerful will might exist, a Yes to life, a need for this
predominance.
“Life is not worthwhile” ; “resignation” ; “why the tears?”—
a weakly and sentimental way of thinking. "Un monstre gai vaut
mieux qu’un sentimental ennuyeux.”18
36 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
The philosophical nihilist is convinced that all that happens
is meaningless and in vain; and that there ought not to be any­
thing meaningless and in vain. But whence this: there ought not
to be? From where does one get this “meaning,” this standard?—
At bottom, the nihilist thinks that the sight of such a bleak, useless
existence makes a philosopher feel dissatisfied, bleak, desperate.
Such an insight goes against our finer sensibility as philosophers.
It amounts to the absurd valuation: to have any right to be, the
character of existence would have to give the philosopher
pleasure.—
Now it is easy to see that pleasure and displeasure can only
be means in the course of events: the question remains whether
19“A gay monster is worth more than a sentimental bore.” Cf. section
91 below.

24

T H E W I L L TO P O WE R

we are at all able to see the “meaning,” the “aim,” whether the
question of meaninglessness or its opposite is not insoluble for
us.—
37 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The development of pessimism into nihilism.— Denaturaliza­
tion of values. Scholasticism of values. Detached and idealistic,
values, instead of dominating and guiding action, turn against
action and condemn it.
Opposites replace natural degrees and ranks. Hatred against
the order of rank. Opposites suit a plebeian age because easier
to comprehend.
The repudiated world versus an artificially built “true, valu­
able” one.— Finally: one discovers of what material one has
built the “true world” : and now all one has left is the repudiated
world, and one adds this supreme disappointment to the reasons
why it deserves to be repudiated.
At this point nihilism is reached: all one has left are the
values that pass judgment— nothing else.
Here the problem of strength and weakness originates:
1. The weak perish of it;
2. those who are stronger destroy what does not
perish;
3. those who are strongest overcome the values that pass
judgment.
In sum this constitutes the tragic age.
38 ( 1883-1888)
Recently much mischief has been done with an accidental
and in every way
unsuitable word: everywhere “pessimism” is
discussed, and the question is debated whether pessmism or op­
timism is right, as if there must be answers to that.
One fails to see, although it could hardly be more obvious,
that pessimism is not a problem but a symptom, that the name
should be replaced by “nihilism,” that the question whether notto-be is better than to be is itself a disease, a sign of decline, an
idiosyncrasy.
The nihilistic movement is merely the expression of physio­
logical decadence.

book o n e: European Nihilism

25

39 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
To be comprehended: That every kind of decay and sickness
has continually helped to form overall value judgments; that
decadence has actually gained predominance in the value judgments
that have become accepted; that we not only have to fight against
the consequences of all present misery of degeneration, but that
all previous decadence is still residual, i.e., survives. Such a total
aberration of mankind from its basic instincts, such a total de­
cadence of value judgments— that is the question mark par ex­
cellence, the real riddle that the animal “man” poses for the
philosopher.
40 {March-1une 1888)
The concept of decadence.— Waste, decay, elimination need
not be condemned: they are necessary consequences of life, of the
growth of life. The phenomenon of decadence is as necessary as
any increase and advance of life: one is in no position to abolish
it. Reason demands, on the contrary, that we do justice to it.
It is a disgrace for all socialist systematizers that they suppose
there could be circumstances— social combinations—in which
vice, disease, prostitution, distress would no longer grow,— But
that means condemning life.— A society is not free to remain
young. And even at the height of its strength it has to form refuse
and waste materials. The more energetically and boldly it advances,
the richer it will be in failures and deformities, the closer to de­
cline.— Age is not abolished by means of institutions. Neither is
disease. Nor vice.
41 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
Basic insight regarding the nature of decadence: its supposed
causes are* its consequences.
This changes the whole perspective of moral problems.
The whole moral struggle against vice, luxury, crime, even
disease, appears a naivete and superfluous: there is no “improve­
ment” (against repentance).
Decadence itself is nothing to be fought: it is absolutely

26

TH E W I L L TO P O WE R

necessary and belongs to every age and every people. What should
be fought vigorously is the contagion of the healthy parts of the
organism.
Is this being done? The opposite is done. Precisely that is
attempted in the name of humanity.
—How are the supreme values held so far, related to this
basic biological question? Philosophy, religion, morality, art, etc.
(The cure: e.g., militarism, beginning with Napoleon who
considered civilization his natural enemy.)19
42 {March-June 1888)
First principle:
The supposed causes of degeneration are its consequences.
But the supposed remedies of degeneration are also mere
palliatives against some of its effects: the “cured” are merely one
type of the degenerates.
Consequences of decadence: vice— the addiction to vice;
sickness— sickliness; crime— criminality; celibacy—sterility; hystericism—weakness of the will; alcoholism; pessimism; anarchism;
libertinism (also of the spirit). The slanderers, underminers,
doubters, destroyers.
43 ( March-June 1888)
On the concept of decadence.
1. Skepticism is a consequence of decadence, as is libertinism
of the spirit.
2. The corruption of morals is a consequence of decadence
(weakness of the will, need for strong stimuli).
3. Attempted cures, psychological and moral, do not change
the course of decadence, do not arrest it, are physiologically
naught:
Insight into the great nullity of these presumptuous “re­
actions” ; they are forms of narcotization against certain terrible
consequences; they do not eliminate the morbid element; often
they are heroic attempts to annul the man of decadence and to
realize the minimum of his harmfulness.

fusing cause and effect”; also sections 334 and 380 below.

4. Nihilism is no cause but merely the logical result of de­
cadence*
5. The “good” and “bad” man are merely two types of de­
cadence: in all basic phenomena they agree.
6. The social question is a consequence of decadence.
7. Sicknesses, especially those affecting nerves and head, are
signs that the defensive strength of the strong natures is lacking;
precisely this is suggested by irritability, so pleasure and displeasure
become foreground problems.

Most general types of decadence:
1. Believing one chooses remedies, one chooses in fact that
which hastens exhaustion; Christianity is an example (to name the
greatest example of such an aberration of the instincts); “progress”
is another instance.—
2. One loses one’s power of resistance against stimuli— and
comes to be at the mercy of accidents: one coarsens and enlarges
one’s experiences tremendously— “depersonalization,” disintegra­
tion of the will; example: one whole type of morality, the altruistic
one which talks much of pity— and is distinguished by the weakness
of the personality, so that it is sounded, too, 21 and like an overstimulated string vibrates continually— an extreme irritability.—
3. One confuses cause and effect: one fails to understand
decadence as a physiological condition and mistakes its conse­
quences for the real cause of the indisposition; example: all of
religious morality.—
4. One longs for a condition in which one no longer suffers:
life is actually experienced as the ground of ills; one esteems un­
conscious states, without feeling, (sleep, fainting) as incomparably
more valuable than conscious ones;22 from this a method—

On the hygiene of the “w eak”— Everything done in weak­
ness fails. Moral: do nothing. Only there is the hitch that pre­
cisely the strength to suspend activity, not to react, is sickest of
all under the influence of weakness: one never reacts more quickly
and blindly than when one should not react at all.—
A strong nature manifests itself by waiting and postponing
any reaction:23 it is as much characterized by a certain adiaphoria24
as weakness is by an involuntary countermovement and the
suddenness and inevitability of “action.”— The will is weak—
and the prescription to avoid stupidities would be to have a strong
will and to do nothing.— Contradictio.— A kind of self-destruc­
tion; the instinct of preservation is compromised.— The weak
harm themselves.— That is the type of decadence.—
In fact, we find a tremendous amount of reflection about
practices that would lead to impassability. The instinct is on the
right track insofar as doing nothing is more expedient than doing
something.—
All the practices of the orders, the solitary philosophers, the
fakirs are inspired by the right value standard that a certain kind
of man cannot benefit himself more than by preventing himself
as much as possible from acting.—
Means of relief: absolute obedience, machinelike activity,
avoidance of people and things that would demand instant deci­
sions and actions.
46 (March-1 une 1888)
Weakness of the will: that is a metaphor that can prove mis­
leading. For there is no will, and consequently neither a strong
nor a weak will.25 The multitude and disgregation of impulses
and the lack of any systematic order among them result in a “weak
will”; their coordination under a single predominant impulse re­
sults in a “strong will” : in the first case it is the oscillation and

the lack of gravity; in the latter, the precision and clarity of the
direction.
47 (March-June 1888)
What is inherited is not the sickness but sickliness: the lack
of strength to resist the danger of infections, etc., the broken
resistance; morally speaking, resignation and meekness in face
of the enemy.
I
have asked myself if all the supreme values of previous
philosophy, morality, and religion could not be compared to the
values of the weakened, the mentally ill, and neurasthenics: in a
milder form, they represent the same ills.—
It is the value of all morbid states that they show us under
a magnifying glass certain states that are normal— but not easily
visible when normal.—
Health and sickness are not essentially different, as the
ancient physicians and some practitioners even today suppose.
One must not make of them distinct principles or entities that
fight over the living organism and turn it into their arena. That is
silly nonsense and chatter that is no good any longer. In fact,
there are only differences in degree between these two kinds of
existence: the exaggeration, the disproportion, the nonharmony
of the normal phenomena constitute the pathological state (Claude
Bernard).
Just as "evil'’ can be considered as exaggeration, disharmony,
disproportion, “the good” may be a protective diet against the
danger of exaggeration, disharmony, and disproportion.
Hereditary weakness as the dominant feeling: cause of the
supreme values.
N.B. One wants weakness: why? Usually because one is
necessarily weak.
— Weakness as a task: weakening the desires, the feelings
of pleasure and displeasure, the will to power, to a sense of pride,
to want to have and have more; weakening as meekness; weaken­
ing as faith; weakening as aversion and shame in the face of
everything natural, as negation of life, as sickness and habitual
weakness— weakening as the renunciation of revenge, of resistance,
of enmity and wrath.
The error in treatment: one does not want to fight weakness

30

with a systeme fortifiant>20 but rather with a kind of justification
and moralization\ i.e., with an interpretation.—
— Two totally different states confounded: e.g., the calm of
strength, which is essentially forbearance from reaction (type of
the gods whom nothing moves)— and the calm of exhaustion
rigidity to the point of anesthesia. All philosophic-ascetic pro­
cedures aim at the second* but really intend the former—for they
attribute predicates to the attained state as if a divine state had
been attained.
48 (March-June 1888)
The most dangerous misunderstanding.— One concept ap­
parently permits no confusion or ambiguity: that of exhaustion♦
Exhaustion can be acquired or inherited—in any case it changes
the aspect of things, the value of things.—
As opposed to those who, from the fullness they represent
and feel, involuntarily give to things and see them fuller, more
powerful, and pregnant with future— who at least are able to
bestow something— the exhausted diminish and botch all they
see— they impoverish the value: they are harmful.—
About this no mistake seems possible: yet history contains
the gruesome fact that the exhausted have always been mistaken
for the fullest— and the fullest for the most harmful
Those poor in life, the weak, impoverish life; those rich in
life, the strong, enrich it. The first are parasites of life; the second
give presents to it.— How is it possible to confound these two?
When the exhausted appeared with the gesture of the highest
activity and energy (when degeneration effected an excess of
spiritual and nervous discharge), they were mistaken for the rich.
They excited fear.— The cult of the fool is always the cult of
those rich in life, the powerful. The fanatic, the possessed, the
religious epileptic, all eccentrics have been experienced as the
highest types of power: as divine.
This kind of strength that excites fear was considered pre­
eminently divine: here was the origin of authority; here one inter­
preted, heard, sought wisdom.— This led to the development,
almost everywhere, of a will to “deify,” i.e., a will to the typical
degeneration of spirit, body, and nerves: an attempt to find the
way to this higher level of being. To make oneself sick, mad, to

provoke the symptoms of derangement and ruin—that was taken
for becoming stronger, more superhuman, more terrible, wiser.27
One thought that in this way one became so rich in power that
one could give from one’s fullness. Wherever one adored one
sought one who could give.
Here the experience of intoxication proved misleading. This
increases the feeling of power in the highest degree—therefore,
naively judged, power itself. On the highest rung of power one
placed the most intoxicated, the ecstatic. (—There are two sources
of intoxication: the over-great fullness of life and a state of patho­
logical nourishment of the brain.)28
49 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
Acquired, not inherited, exhaustion: (1) Inadequate nourish­
ment, often from ignorance about norishment; e.g,, among scholars.
(2) Erotic precociousness: the curse in particular of French youth,
above all in Paris, who emerge into the world from their lycees
botched and soiled and never free themselves again from the chain
of contemptible inclinations, ironical and disdainful toward them­
selves—galley slaves with all refinements (incidentally, in most
cases already a symptom of the decadence of race and family, like
all hypersensitivity; also the contagion of the milieu— to let one­
self be determined by one’s environment is decadent), (3) Alcohol­
ism— not the instinct but the habit, the stupid imitation, the
cowardly or vain assimilation to a dominant regime:
What a blessing a Jew is among Germans! How much dull­
ness, how blond the head, how blue the eye; the lack of esprit in
face, word, posture; the lazy stretching-oneself, the German need
for a good rest— not prompted by overwork but by the disgusting
stimulation and overstimulation through alcoholica.—
50 (1888)
Theory of exhaustion.— Vice, the mentally ill (resp., the
artists— ), the criminals, the anarchists— these are not the op­
pressed classes but the scum of previous society of all classes.—
Realizing that all our classes are permeated by these elements,
we understand that modem society is no “society,” no “body,”

The state of corruption.— To understand how all forms of
corruption belong together, without forgetting the Christian cor­
ruption (Pascal as type) as well as the socialist-communist corrup­
tion (a consequence of the Christian—from the point of view of
the natural sciences, the socialists’ conception of the highest society
is the lowest in the order of rank); also the “beyond” corruption:
as if outside the actual world, that of becoming, there were another
world of being.
Here no terms are permissible: here one has to eradicate,
annihilate, wage war; everywhere the Christian-nihilistic value
standard still has to be pulled up and fought under every mask;
e.g., in present-day sociology, in present-day music, in present-day
pessimism (all of them forms of the Christian value ideal).
Either the one is true or the other: true here means elevating
the type of man.
The priest, the shepherd of souls, as objectionable forms of
existence. All of education to date, helpless, untenable, without
center of gravity, stained by the contradiction of values.
52 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
Nature is not immoral when it has no pity for the degenerate:
on the contrary, the growth of physiological and moral ills among
mankind is the consequence of a pathological and unnatural
morality. The sensibility of the majority of men is pathological
and unnatural.
Why is it that mankind is corrupt morally and physiologi­
cally?— The body perishes when an organ is altered. The right of
altruism cannot be derived from physiology; nor can the right to
help and to an equality of lots: these are prizes for the degenerate
and underprivileged.

There is no solidarity in a society in which there are sterile,
unproductive, and destructive elements—which, incidentally, will
have descendants even more degenerate than they are themselves.
53 (March-June 1888)
Even the ideals of science can be deeply, yet completely un­
consciously influenced by decadence: our entire sociology is proof
of that. The objection to it is that from experience it knows only
the form of the decay of society, and inevitably it takes its own
instincts of decay for the norms of sociological judgment.
In these norms the life that is declining in present-day Europe
formulates its social ideals: one cannot tell them from the ideals
of old races that have outlived themselves.—
The herd instinct, then— a power that has now become
sovereign— is something totally different from the instinct of an
aristocratic society: and the value of the units determines the
significance of the sum.— Our entire sociology simply does not
know any other instinct than that of the herd, i.e., that of the
sum of zeroes—where every zero has “equal rights,” where it is
virtuous to be zero.—
The valuation that is today applied to the different forms of
society is entirely identical with that which assigns a higher value
to peace than to war: but this judgment is antibiological, is itself
a fruit of the decadence of life.— Life is a consequence of war,
society itself a means to war.— As a biologist, Mr. Herbert
Spencer is a decadent; as a moralist, too (he considers the triumph
of altruism a desideratum! ! !).29
54 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
It is my good fortune that after whole millennia of error and
confusion I have rediscovered the way that leads to a Yes and a
No.
I teach the No to all that makes weak— that exhausts.
I teach the Yes to all that strengthens, that stores up strength,
that justifies the feeling of strength.
So far one has taught neither the one nor the other: virtue

has been taught, mortification of the self, pity, even the negation
of life. All these are the values of the exhausted.
Prolonged reflection on the physiology of exhaustion forced
me to ask to what extent the judgments of the exhausted had
penetrated the world of values.
My result was as surprising as possible, even for me who was
at home in many a strange world: I found that all of the supreme
value judgments— all that have come to dominate mankind, at
least that part that has become tame— can be derived from the
judgments of the exhausted.
Under the holiest names I pulled up destructive tendencies;
one has called God what weakens, teaches weakness, infects with
weakness.— I found that the “good man” is one of the forms in
which decadence affirms itself.
That virtue of which Schopenhauer still taught that it is the
supreme, the only virtue, and the basis of all virtues— precisely
pity I recognized as more dangerous than any vice. To cross as
a matter of principle selection in the species and its purification of
refuse—that has so far been called virtue par excellence«—
One should respect fatality— that fatality that says to the
weak: perish!—
One has called it God— that one resisted fatality, that one
corrupted mankind and made it rot.— One should not use the
name of God in vain.—
The race is corrupted— not by its vices but by its ignorance;
it is corrupted because it did not recognize exhaustion as exhaus­
tion: mistakes about physiological states are the source of all ills.—
Virtue is our greatest misunderstanding.
Problem: How did the exhausted come to make the laws
about values? Put differently: How did those come to power who
are the last?— How did the instinct of the human animal come to
stand on its head?—30

Extreme positions are not succeeded by moderate ones but
by extreme positions of the opposite kind. Thus the belief in the
absolute immorality of nature, in aim- and meaninglessness, is
the psychologically necessary affect once the belief in God and
an essentially moral order becomes untenable. Nihilism appears at
that point, not that the displeasure at existence has become greater
than before but because one has come to mistrust any “meaning”
in suffering, indeed in existence* One interpretation has collapsed;
but because it was considered the interpretation it now seems as
if there were no meaning at all in existence, as if everything were
in vain.
*
That this “in vain” constitutes the character of present-day
nihilism remains to be shown. The mistrust of our previous valua­
tions grows until it becomes the question: “Are not all ‘values’
lures that draw out the comedy without bringing it closer to a
solution?” Duration “in vain,” ;without end or aim, is the most
paralyzing idea, particularly when one understands that one is
being fooled and yet lacks the power not to be fooled.
♦
Let us think this thought in its most terrible form: existence
as it is, without meaning or aim, yet recurring inevitably without
any finale of nothingness: “the eternal recurrence
“Plunging down—negating life—that, too, was supposed to be experi­
enced as a kind of sunrise transfiguration, deification.
“I want to make the concept of ‘progress* more precise and am afraid
that toward that end I have to fly in the face of modem ideas (but I am
comforted by the fact that they really have no faces but only masks).
“Diseased limbs should be amputated: the first moral of society.
“A correction of the instincts: their detachment from ignorance—
“I despise those who demand of society that it ought to protect itself
from those who would harm it. That is not enough by a long, shot. Society
is a body in which no member may be diseased without endangering the
whole. A diseased member that corrupts [the reading of this word is not
certain] has to be amputated: I shall name the amputable types of society.”

T H E WI L L TO P OWE R

This is the most extreme form of nihilism: the nothing (the
"meaningless”), eternally!
The European form of Buddhism: the energy of knowledge
and strength compels this belief. It is the most scientific of all
possible hypotheses. We deny end goals: if existence had one it
would have to have been reached.
*
So one understands that an antithesis to pantheism is at­
tempted here: for "everything perfect, divine, eternal” also compels
a faith in the “eternal recurrence.” Question: does morality make
impossible this pantheistic affirmation of all things, too? At bottom,
it is only the moral god that has been overcome. Does it make sense
to conceive a god “beyond good and evil”? Would a pantheism
in this sense be possible? Can we remove the idea of a goal from
the process and then affirm the process in spite of this?— This
would be the case if something were attained at every moment
within this process— and always the same. Spinoza reached such
an affirmative position in so far as every moment has a logical
necessity, and with his basic instinct, which was logical, he felt
a sense of triumph that the world should be constituted that way.
*

But his case is only a single case. Every basic character trait
that is encountered at the bottom of every event, that finds ex­
pression in every event, would have to lead every individual who
experienced it as his own basic character trait to welcome every
moment of universal existence with a sense of triumph. The
crucial point would be that one experienced this basic character
trait in oneself as good, valuable— with pleasure.
*
It was morality that protected life against despair and the
leap into nothing, among men and classes who were violated and
oppressed by m en: for it is the experience of being powerless
against men, not against nature, that generates the most desperate
embitterment against existence. Morality treated the violent despots,
the doers of violence, the “masters” in general as the enemies
against whom the common man must be protected, which means
first of all encouraged and strengthened. Morality consequently
taught men to hate and despise most profoundly what is the basic

book o n e : European Nihilism

37

character trait of those who rule: their will to power. To abolish,
deny, and dissolve this morality— that would mean looking at the
best-hated drive with an opposite feeling and valuation. If the
suffering and oppressed lost the faith that they have the right to
despise the will to power, they would enter the phase of hopeless
despair. This would be the case if this trait were essential to life
and it could be shown that even in this will to morality this very
“will to power” were hidden, and even this hatred and contempt
were still a will to power. The oppressed would come to see that
they were on the same plain with the oppressors, without preroga­
tive, without higher rank.
*
Rather the opposite! There is nothing to life that has value,
except the degree of power— assuming that life itself is the will to
power. Morality guarded the underprivileged against nihilism by
assigning to each an infinite value, a metaphysical value, and by
placing each in an order that did not agree with the worldly order
of rank and power: it taught resignation, meekness, etc. Supposing
that the faith in this morality would perish, then the underprivileged
would no longer have their comfort— and they would perish.
*

This perishing takes the form of self-destruction—the instinc­
tive selection of that which must destroy. Symptoms of this selfdestruction of the underprivileged: self-vivisection, poisoning,
intoxication, romanticism, above all the instinctive need for actions
that turn the powerful into mortal enemies (as it were, one breeds
one’s own hangmen); the will to destruction as the will of a still
deeper instinct, the instinct of self-destruction, the will for nothing­
ness*
*
Nihilism as a symptom that the underprivileged have no
comfort left; that they destroy in order to be destroyed; that with­
out morality they no longer have any reason to “resign themselves”
— that they place themselves on the plain of the opposite principle
and also want power by compelling the powerful to become their
hangmen. This is the European form of Buddhism— doing No
after all existence has lost its “meaning.”

TH E W I L L TO P OWE R

*
It is not that “distress” has grown: on the contrary. “God,
morality, resignation,” were remedies on terribly low rungs of
misery: active nihilism appears in relatively much more favorable
conditions. The feeling that morality has been overcome presup­
poses a fair degree of spiritual culture, and this in turn that one
is relatively well off. A certain spiritual weariness that, owing to
the long fight of philosophical opinions, has reached the most
hopeless skepticism regarding all philosophy, is another sign of
the by no means low position of these nihilists. Consider the situa­
tion in which the Buddha appeared. The doctrine of the eternal
recurrence would have scholarly presuppositions (as did the
Buddha’s doctrine; e.g., the concept of causality, etc.).
*
What does “underprivileged” mean? Above all, physiologi­
cally— no longer politically. The unhealthiest kind of man in Eu­
rope (in all classes) furnishes the soil for this nihilism: they will
experience the belief in the eternal recurrence as a curse, struck by
which one no longer shrinks from any action; not to be extinguished
passively but to extinguish everything that is so aim- and meaningless, although this is a mere convulsion, a blind rage at the insight
that everything has been for eternities—even this moment of
nihilism and lust for destruction.— It is the value of such a crisis
that it purifies, that it pushes together related elements to perish
of each other, that it assigns common tasks to men who have
opposite ways of thinking—and it also brings to light the weaker
and less secure among them and thus promotes an order of rank
according to strength, from the point of view of health: those who
command are recognized as those who command, those who obey
as those who obey. Of course, outside every existing social order.
*

Who will prove to be the strongest in the course of this?
The most moderate; those who do not require any extreme articles
of faith; those who not only concede but love a fair amount of
accidents and nonsense; those who can think of man with a con­
siderable reduction of his value without becoming small and weak
on that account: those richest in health who are equal to most
misfortunes and therefore not so afraid of misfortunes—human

beings who are sure of their power and represent the attained
strength of humanity with conscious pride.

How would such a human being even think of the eternal
recurrence?

Periods of European Nihilism
The period of unclarity, of all kinds of tentative men who
would conserve the old without letting go of the new.
The period of clarity: one understands that the old and the
new are basically opposite, the old values born of declining and
the new ones of ascending life— that all the old ideals are hostile
to life (born of decadence and agents of decadence, even if in the
magnificent Sunday clothes of morality)* We understand the
old and are far from strong enough for something new.
The period of the three great affects: contempt, pity, destruc­
tion*
The period of catastrophe: the advent of a doctrine that
sifts men—driving the weak to decisions, and the strong as well—

II. HISTORY OF
EUROPEAN NIHILISM
57 (1884)
My friends, it was hard for us when we were young: we suf­
fered youth itself like a serious sickness. That is due to the time
into which we have been thrown33— a time of extensive inner
decay and disintegration, a time that with all its weaknesses, and
even with its best strength, opposes the spirit of youth. Disintegra­
tion characterizes this time, and thus uncertainty: nothing stands
firmly on its feet or on a hard faith in itself; one lives for tomorrow,
as the day after tomorrow is dubious.84 Everything on our way
is slippery and dangerous, and the ice that still supports us has
become thin: all of us feel the warm, uncanny breath of the thaw­
ing wind;35 where we still walk, soon no one will be able to walk.
58 (1885-1888)
If this is not an age of decay and declining vitality, it is at
least one of headlong and arbitrary experimentation:— and it is
probable that a superabundance of bungled experiments should
create an overall impression as of decay— and perhaps even decay
itself.
59 (1885-1886)
Toward a History of the Modern Eclipse36
The state nomads (civil servants, etc.): without home.
The decline of the family.
The “good man” as a symptom of exhaustion.
Justice as will to power (breeding).
33
Geworfen. In Heidegger’s Sein und Zeit (1927; Being and Time,
1962), Geivorfenheit (thrownness) becomes an important category (sections
29, 31, 38, 58, 68b).
84This is not how most of Nietzsche’s contemporaries felt in 1884,
” Cf. Zarathustra III, “On Old and New Tablets,” section 8 (Portable
Nietzsche, p. 313).

Lasciviousness and neurosis.
Black music: whither refreshing music?
The anarchist.
Contempt for man, nausea.
Deepest difference: whether hunger or overabundance be­
comes creative? The former generates the ideals of romanticism.87
Nordic unnaturalness.
The need for alcoholica: the “distress” of the workers.
Philosophical nihilism.
60 (.1885)
The slow emergence and rise of the middle and lower classes
(including the lower kind of spirit and body), of which one finds
many preludes before the French Revolution— and it would have
taken place without the Revolution, too— on the whole, then, the
predominance of the herd over all shepherds and bellwethers—■
involves
1. eclipse of the spirit (the fusion of a Stoic and a frivolous
appearance of happiness, characteristic of noble cultures, decreases;
one lets much suffering be seen and heard that one formerly bore
and hid);
2. moral hypocrisy (a way of wishing to distinguish oneself
not by means of morality, but by means of the herd virtues: pity,
consideration, moderation, which are not recognized and honored
outside the herd ability);
3. a really great amount of shared suffering (pity) and joy
(the pleasure in large-scale associations found in all herd animals
— “community spirit,” “Fatherland,” everything in which the
individual does not count).
61 (Summer-Fall 1883)
Our time, with its aspiration to remedy and prevent accidental
distresses and to wage preventive war against disagreeable pos­
sibilities, is a time of the poor. Our “rich”— are poorest of all.
The true purpose of all riches is forgotten.

to the 2nd ed., 1887), and section 1,009 below.

62 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Critique of modern man (his moralistic mendaciousness):®8
—the “good man” corrupted and seduced by bad institutions
(tyrants and priests); —reason as authority; — history as over­
coming of errors; — the future as progress; — the Christian state
( “the Lord of hosts” ); — the Christian sex impulse (or m arriage);
—the kingdom of “justice” (the cult of “humanity”); — “free­
dom.”
The romantic pose of modern man: — the noble man (Byron,
Victor Hugo, George Sand); — noble indignation; — consecration
through passion (as true “nature” ); — siding with the oppressed
and underprivileged: motto of the historians and novelists; — the
Stoics of duty;— selflessness as art and knowledge;— altruism
as the most mendacious form of egoism (utilitarianism), most
sentimental egoism.
All this is eighteenth century. What, on the other hand, has
not been inherited from it: insouciance, cheerfulness, elegance,
brightness of the spirit. The tempo of the spirit has changed; the
enjoyment of refinement and clarity of the spirit has given place to
the enjoyment of color, harmony, mass, reality, etc. Sensualism
in matters of the spirit. In short, it is the eighteenth century of
Rousseau.
63 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
On the whole, a tremendous quantum of humaneness has
been attained in present-day mankind. That this is not felt gen­
erally is itself a proof: we have become so sensitive concerning
small states of distress that we unjustly ignore what has been
attained.
Here one must make allowance for the existence of much
decadence, and seen with such eyes our world has to look wretched
and miserable. But such eyes have at all times seen the same
things:
1. a certain overirritation even of the moral feelings;
2. the quantum of embitterment and eclipse that pessimism

carries into judgments: these two together account for the pre­
dominance of the opposite notion, that our morality is in a bad
way.
The fact of credit, of worldwide trade, of the means of
transportation—here a tremendous mild trust in man finds expres­
sion.— Another contributing factor is
3,
the emancipation of science from moral and religious
purposes: a very good sign that, however, is usually misunderstood.
In my own way I attempt a justification of history.
64 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The second Buddhism. The nihilistic catastrophe that finishes
Indian culture.— Early signs of it: The immense increase of
pity. Spiritual weariness. The reduction of problems to questions
of pleasure and displeasure. The war glory that provokes a
counterstroke. Just as national demarcation provokes a counter­
movement, the most cordial “fraternity.” The impossibility for
religion to go on working with dogmas and fables.
65 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
What is attacked deep down today is the instinct and the
will of tradition: all institutions that owe their origins to this
instinct violate the taste of the modern spirit.— At bottom, nothing
is thought and done without the purpose of eradicating this sense
for tradition. One considers tradition a fatality; one studies it,
recognizes it (as “heredity” ), but one does not want it. The tens­
ing of a will over long temporal distances, the selection of the
states and valuations that allow one to dispose of future centuries
—precisely this is antimodern in the highest degree. Which goes
to show that it is the disorganizing principles that give our age
its character.
66 (Spring-Fall 1887)
“Be simple!”—for us complicated and elusive triers of the
reins a demand that is a simple stupidity.— Be natural! But how
if one happens to be “unnatural”?

67 (1884)
The former means for obtaining homogeneous, enduring char­
acters for long generations: unalienable landed property, honoring
the old (origin of the belief in gods and heroes as ancestors).
Now the breaking up of landed property belongs to the
opposite tendency: newspapers (in place of daily prayers), rail­
way, telegraph. Centralization of a tremendous number of different
interests in a single soul, which for that reason must be very
strong and protean.
68 (March-June 1888)
Why everything turns into histrionics.— Modern man lacks:
the sure instinct (consequence of a long homogeneous form of
activity of one kind of m an); the inability to achieve anything
perfect is merely a consequence of this: as an individual one
can never make up for lost schooling.
That which creates a morality, a code of laws: the profound
instinct that only automatism makes possible perfection in life
and creation.
But now we have reached the opposite point; indeed, we
wanted to reach it: the most extreme consciousness, man’s ability
to see through himself and history. With this we are practically
as far as possible from perfection in being, doing, and willing:
our desire, even our will for knowledge is a symptom of a tre­
mendous decadence. We strive for the opposite of that which
strong races, strong natures want—understanding is an ending.—
That science is possible in this sense that is cultivated today
is proof that all elementary instincts, life’s instincts of self-defense
and protection, no longer function. We no longer collect, we
squander the capital of our ancestors, even in the way in which
we seek knowledge.—

f ir s t

Plan of the first book
What is dawning is the opposition of the world we revere and the world
we live and are. So we can abolish either our reverence or ourselves. The
latter constitutes nihilism.
1. The advent of nihilism, theoretical and practical. Its faulty derivation
(pessimism, its kinds: preludes of nihilism, although not necessary).
2. Christianity perishing of its morality. “God is truth”; “God is love”;
“the just God.”— The greatest event—“God is dead”—perceived dimly.
3. Morality, now without any sanction, no longer knows how to maintain
itself. Eventually one drops the moral interpretation (echoes of the Christian
value judgments still fill men’s feelings).
4. But it was upon moral judgments that value was based so far; above all,
the value of philosophy (“of the will to truth”). (The popular ideals—“the
sage,” “the prophet,” “the saint”—have collapsed.)
5. Nihilistic trait in the natural sciences. . . .
[(5) through (9) appear above as (a) through (e).]
10. The whole European system of human aspirations has the feeling it
is partly meaningless, partly even now “immoral.” Probability of a new

46

T H E W I L L TO P O WE R

d. Ditto in history: fatalism, Darwinism; the final attempts
to read reason and divinity into it fail Sentimentality in face of
the past; one could not endure a biography!— (Here, too, phe­
nomenalism: character as a mask; there are no facts.)
e. Ditto in art: romanticism and its counterstroke (aver­
sion against romantic ideals and lies). The latter, moral as a
sense of greater truthfulness, but pessimistic. Pure “artists” (in­
different toward content). (Father-confessor psychology and puri­
tan psychology, two forms of psychological romanticism: but
even its counterproposal, the attempt to adopt a purely artistic
Buddhism, The greatest danger,— “How are truthfulness, love, and justice
related to the actual world?*’ Not at all!—
For the second book
Origin and critique of moral valuations. These two things don’t coincide,
as is often supposed (this belief itself is the result of a moral judgment to
the effect that “something that has come to be in such and such a way is
worth little because its origin is immoral”). Standard for determining the
value of moral valuations: critique of the words, “Improvement, perfecting,
enhancement.”
The basic fact that has been overlooked: the contradiction between “be­
coming more moral” and the enhancement and strengthening of the type
of man.
Homo natura. The “will to power,”
For the third book
The will to power.
How those men would have to be constituted who would accomplish this
revaluation in themselves.
The order of rank as an order of power: war and danger as presupposi­
tions that a rank maintains its conditions. The grandiose model: man in
nature—the weakest, cleverest being making itself master and subjugating
the more stupid elements.
For the fourth book
The greatest struggle: for that a new weapon is needed. The hammer: to
conjure up a terrible decision, to confront Europe with the final choice
whether its will “wills” its own destruction [Untergang], Prevention of the
decline into mediocrity [Vermittelmassigwig]. Rather even destruction [Lieber
noch Untergang]!
In the preface to Twilight of the Idols, written in 1888 and published in
January 1889, the image of the hammer is sublimated: “For once to pose
questions here with a hammer, and, perhaps, to hear as a reply that famous
hollow sound which speaks of bloated entrails—what a delight for one who
has ears even behind his ears, for me, an old psychologist . .

attitude toward man— even there the opposite valuation is not
yet ventured!)
70 ( 1885-1886)
Against the doctrine of the influence of the milieu and
external causes: the force within is infinitely superior; much that
looks like external influence is merely its adaptation from within.
The very same milieus can be interpreted and exploited in oppo­
site ways: there are no facts.— A genius is not explained in terms
of such conditions of his origin.40
71 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
“Modernity” in the perspective of the metaphor of nourish­
ment and digestion.—
Sensibility immensely more irritable (— dressed up moralistically: the increase in pity— ); the abundance of disparate impres­
sions greater than ever: cosmopolitanism in foods, literatures,
newspapers, forms, tastes, even landscapes. The tempo of this
influx prestissimo; the impressions erase each other; one instinc­
tively resists taking in anything, taking anything deeply, to
"digest” anything; a weakening of the power to digest results
from this. A kind of adaptation to this flood of impressions takes
place: men unlearn spontaneous action, they merely react to
stimuli from outside. They spend their strength partly in assimilat­
ing things, partly in defense, partly in opposition. Profound weak­
ening of spontaneity; the historian, critic, analyst, the interpreter,
the observer, the collector, the reader— all of them reactive talents
— all science!
Artificial change of one’s nature into a “mirror” ; interested
but, as it were, merely epidemically interested; a coolness on
principle, a balance, a fixed low temperature closely underneath
the thin surface on which warmth, movement, “tempest,” and the
play of waves are encountered.
Opposition of external mobility and a certain deep heaviness
and weariness.

Where does our modern world belong— to exhaustion or
ascent?— Its manifoldness and unrest conditioned by the attain­
ment of the highest level of consciousness.
73 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Overwork, curiosity and sympathy—our modern vices.
74 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Toward a characterization of “modernity.”— Overabundant
development of intermediary forms; atrophy of types; traditions
break off, schools; the overlordship of the instincts (prepared
philosophically: the unconscious worth more) after the will power,
the willing of end and means, has been weakened.
75 (1885)
An able craftsman or scholar cuts a fine figure when he takes
pride in his art and looks on life content and satisfied. But nothing
looks more wretched than when a shoemaker or schoolmaster gives
us to understand with a suffering mien that he was really born
for something better. There is nothing better than what is good—
and good is having some ability and using that to create, Tiichtigkeit or virtu in the Italian Renaissance sense.
Today, in our time when the state has an absurdly fat stomach,
there are in all fields and departments, in addition to the real
workers, also “representatives” ; e.g., besides the scholars also
scribblers, besides the suffering classes also garrulous, boastful
ne’er-do-wells who “represent” this suffering, not to speak of the
professional politicians who are well off while “ representing”
distress with powerful lungs before a parliament. Our modern
life is extremely expensive owing to the large number of inter­
mediaries; in an ancient city, on the other hand, and, echoing
that, also in many cities in Spain and Italy, one appeared oneself
and would have given a hoot to such modem representatives and
intermediaries— or a kick!

The predominance of dealers and intermediaries in spiritual
matters, too: the scribbler, the “representative,” the historian (who
fuses past and present), the exotician and cosmopolitan, the
intermediaries between science and philosophy, the semitheologians.

Nothing to date has nauseated me more than the parasites
of the spirit: in our unhealthy Europe one already finds them
everywhere— and they have the best conscience in the world. Per­
haps a little dim, a little air pessimiste, but in the main voracious,
dirty, dirtying, creeping in, nestling, thievish, scurvy— and as inno­
cent as all little sinners and microbes. They live off the fact that
other people have spirit and squander it: they know that it is
of the very essence of the rich spirit to squander itself care­
lessly, without petty caution, from day to day.— For the spirit
is a bad householder and pays no heed to how everybody lives
and feeds on it,

Histrionics
The colorfulness of modern man and its charm. Essentially
concealment and satiety.
The scribbler.

lack of probity in prior training and schooling (From entin);41

of literature);
the novelists (Walter Scott, but also the Nibelungen monsters along
with the most nervous m usic);

The modern spirit’s lack of discipline, dressed up in all sorts
of moral fashions.— The showy words are: tolerance (for “the
incapacity for Yes and No” ) ; la largeur de sympathies ( = onethird indifference, one-third curiosity, one-third pathological irri­
tability); “objectivity” (lack of personality, lack of will, inca­
pacity for “love” ); “freedom” versus rules (romanticism); “truth”
versus forgery and lies (naturalism); being “scientific” (the "docu­
ment humain”: in other words, the novel of colportage and
addition in place of composition); “passion” meaning disorder
and immoderation; “depth” meaning confusion, the profuse chaos
of symbols.
80 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
Toward a critique of the big words.— I am full of suspicion
and malice against what they call “ideals” : this is my pessimism,
to have recognized how the “higher feelings” are a source of mis­
fortune and man’s loss of value.
One is deceived every time one expects “progress” from an
ideal; every time so far the victory of the ideal has meant a
retrograde movement.
Christianity, the revolution, the abolition of slavery, equal
rights, philanthropy, love of peace, justice, truth: all these big
words have value only in a fight, as flags: not as realities but as
showy words for something quite different (indeed, opposite!).48

One knows the kind of human being who has fallen in love
with the motto, tout comprendre c’est tout pardonner,44 It is the

in all. It is the philosophy of disappointment that wraps itself
so humanely in pity and looks sweet.

here the famous diners chez Magny are described most vividly, those diners
at which the cleverest [geistreichste] and most skeptical band of Parisian
spirits of that time assembled twice a month (Sainte-Beuve, Flaubert, Theophile Gautier, Taine, Renan, the Goncourts, Scherer, Gavani, occasionally
Turgenev, etc.). Exasperated pessimism, cynicism, and nihilism alternating
with much exuberance [A usgeiassenheit] and good humor; I myself shouldn’t
fit in badly at all. I know these gentlemen by heart, so well that I am really

lack the same thing—4la force/ " See also section 915 below.
Of the men enumerated in the parenthesis, all but the last three are
mentioned in The Will to Power (see the Index), and of these all but
Gautier are also mentioned in the books Nietzsche himself published. In
Twilight, “Skirmishes,” whole sections are devoted to Renan (#2) and
Sainte Beuve (# 3 ), the brothers Goncourt are characterized in sections
1 and 7; and Flaubert is mentioned often, also in Nietzsche’s other books.
Practically all of these references are hostile. (For Renan see also my
note on Genealogy III, section 26.) Hippolyte Taine, on the other hand,
is mentioned favorably in Beyond Good and Evil and in the Genealogy>
and Nietzsche corresponded with him.
Edmond Henri Adolphe Scherer (1815-89), ordained and appointed
to a professorship in the Ecole Evangelique at Geneva in 1843, resigned
six years later and gradually abandoned Protestant doctrine, He became
a Hegelian, settled in Paris, and made his reputation as a literary critic.
Gavarni was the pen name of Sulpice Guillaume Chevalier (1801-66),
an outstanding Parisian caricaturist. He is said to have initiated the diners
chez Magny, mentioned in the text.
Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev (1818-83), the great Russian novelist, is
never mentioned in Nietzsche's books.

un chaos.” This prophecy we have fulfilled, after the feeble-opti­
mistic eighteenth century had prettified and rationalized man.
Schopenhauer and Pascal.— In an important sense, Schopen­
hauer is the first to take up again the movement of Pascal: un
monstre et un chaos, consequently something to be negated.—
History, nature, man himself.
“Our inability to know the truth is the consequence of our
corruption, our moral decay” ; thus Pascal. And thus, at bottom,
Schopenhauer. “The deeper the corruption of reason, the more
necessary the doctrine of salvation”— or, in Schopenhauer’s terms,
negation.
84 ( Spring-Fall 1887)
Schopenhauer as throwback (state before the revolution):
Pity, sensuality, art, weakness of the will, catholicism of spiritual
cravings— that is good eighteenth century au fond.46
Schopenhauer's basic misunderstanding of the will (as if
craving, instinct, drive were the essence of will) is typical: lower­
ing the value of the will to the point of making a real mistake.
Also hatred against willing; attempt to see something higher, indeed
that which is higher and valuable, in willing no more, in “being a
subject without aim and purpose” (in the “pure subject free of
will” ). Great symptom of the exhaustion or the weakness of the
will: for the will is precisely that which treats cravings as their
master and appoints to them their way and measure.47
85 (Jan-Fall 1888)
The unworthy attempt has been made to see Wagner and
Schopenhauer as types of mental illness: one would gain an in­

his robust idealism and “will to truth” he did not dare to liberate
himself from the illusionism of morality that speaks of “freedom”
without wishing to admit to itself what freedom is: the second stage
in the metamorphosis of the “will to power”—for those who lack
freedom. On the first stage one demands justice from those who
are in power. On the second, one speaks of “freedom”— that is,
one wants to get away from those in power. On the third, one
speaks of "equal rights'1— that is, as long as one has not yet gained
1911, p. 499. The dating in the Musarion edition reads: “Spring-Fall 1887;
revised 1888.” The attempt of the editors of the standard edition to turn
this kind of a hasty note into an “aphorism” by omitting “Your” in the
text (the word is duly mentioned in the note on p. 499) is as unfortunate
as it is in keeping with their procedure throughout much of the book. All
subsequent editions, including Schlechta’s, also omit “Your.”
On January 11, 1888, Brandes had written Nietzsche that he was send­
ing him the proofs of a collection of his essays: “ . . The essay on Ibsen is
relatively the best, . . . There is a Nordic writer whose works would interest
you. Sfiren Kierkegaard; he lived 1813-1855 and is in my view one of the
most profound psychologists of all time. . . .”
Nietzsche replied February 19:
. . I have decided that during my
next trip to Germany I want to study the psychological problem of Kierke­
gaard. . . .” Ibsen he did not mention—and he never got around to reading
Kierkegaard,
On March 7, Brandes wrote Nietzsche: “Ibsen must interest you as a
personality. Unfortunately he does not have the same stature as a human
being that he has as a poet. As a mind he has been very dependent on
Kierkegaard and is still rather full of theology, Bjornson actually became a
common lay preacher during his last phase. . .
And November 23, 1888, Brandes wrote Nietzsche: “Believe me, I make
propaganda for you wherever 1 can. Only last week I seriously urged Henrik
Ibsen to study your works. There is a way in which you are related to him,
too, although very distantly. This oddball is great and strong and unfriendly
but nevertheless deserving of love. Strindberg will be pleased that you esteem
him. . . .”
Nietzsche refers to Ibsen in two other places: in section 747 in The
Will to Power and in Ecce Homo, Chapter III, section 5, where he says: “A
whole species of malignant ‘idealism’—which, incidentally, is encountered
among men, too; for example in Henrik Ibsen, this typical old maid—has
the aim of poisoning the good conscience, that which is natural in sexual
love.”
What Nietzsche had actually read of Ibsen’s works is uncertain. His
friend Franz Overbeck wrote him on October 14, 1888: “In Munich I have
also had a few strange impressions in the theater, and have scarcely ever
seen a more skillful German play than The Pillars of Society by Ibsen, by
whom I had not known anything before this. . .
Michael Meyer, the Ibsen scholar and translator, informs me that the
only record he has found of any comment on Nietzsche by Ibsen is in an
interview printed in the newspaper 0rebladet, November 26, 1900, when
Ibsen was 72: “A great thinker has died since we last spoke, Herr Ibsen—
Nietzsche. 4Yes. I wasn’t well acquainted with his work. It wasn’t until a
few years ago that he really became well known. He had a remarkable

Decline of Protestantism: understood as a halfway house both
theoretically and historically. Actual superiority of Catholicism;
the feeling of Protestantism extinguished to such an extent that the
strongest anti-Protestant movements are no longer experienced as
such (for example, Wagner’s Parsifal). All of the higher regions
of the spirit in France are Catholic in their instincts; Bismarck
realizes that Protestantism simply doesn’t exist any more.

talent, but his philosophy prevented him from becoming popular in our
democratic age.* Some say that Nietzsche was a spirit who emerged from
the dark—a Satan— ‘Satan—no. No, Nietzsche wasn't that.’ ” Which isn’t
much. And according to Meyer, Ibsen often said he had “read little of
Kierkegaard and understood Jess.”
Nevertheless it is widely taken for granted—and perhaps rightly—that
Ibsen's Btand was profoundly influenced by Kierkegaard and Ibsen’s An
Enemy of the People brings to mind Kierkegaard’s paean on “That Indi­
vidual,” with its refrain “The crowd is untruth” (found, e.g., in my Existen­
tialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre, 1956, pp. 92-99). And Beyond Good and
Evil (1886) contains some very striking parallels to An Enemy of the People
(written in 1882), which evidently are not due to any influence of the play
on Nietzsche’s book: see my note on section 213 of Beyond Good and Evil,
as well as section 4 of my “Translator’s Preface.”
" “1st eine geistig verdumpftere, fa tilere, gliederstreckendere Form des

means literally “limb-stretching.”

That’s what I call a modest version of Christianity! A homoe­
opathy of Christianity is what I call it.
One reminds me that today we also encounter an immodest
Protestantism— that of the court chaplains50 and anti-Semitic spec­
ulators: but nobody has claimed yet that any “spirit” whatever
“moved” on the faces of these waters.— That is merely a more
indecent form of Christianity, by no means more sensible.
90 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
Progress.— Let us not be deceived! Time marches forward;
we’d like to believe that everything that is in it also marches for­
ward— that the development is one that moves forward.
The most level-headed are led astray by this illusion. But
the nineteenth century does not represent progress over the six­
teenth; and the German spirit of 1888 represents a regress from
the German spirit of 1788.
“Mankind” does not advance, it does not even exist. The over­
all aspect is that of a tremendous experimental laboratory in which
a few successes are scored, scattered throughout all ages, while
there are untold failures, and all order, logic, union, and obliging­
ness are lacking. How can we fail to recognize that the ascent of
Christianity is a movement of decadence?— That the German Ref­
ormation is a recrudescence of Christian barbarism?— That the
Revolution*1 destroyed the instinct for a grand organization of
society?
Man represents no progress over the animal: the civilized
tenderfoot is an abortion compared to the Arab and Corsican; the
Chinese is a more successful type, namely more durable, than the
European.

wake of the Enlightenment. Around 1770 the decline of cheerful­
ness began to be noticed; women, with that feminine instinct which
always sides with virtue, supposed that immorality was the cause.
Galiani hit the nail on the head: he cites Voltaire's verse:
Un monstre gai vaut mieux
Qu*un sentimental ennuyeux.™
When I believe now that I am a few centuries ahead in Enlighten­
ment not only of Voltaire but even of Galiani, who was far profounder—how far must I have got in the increase of dark­
ness!64 And this is really the case, and I bewared in time, with
some sort of regret, of the German and Christian narrowness and
inconsequence of pessimism k la Schopenhauer or, worse, Leopardi,
and sought out the most quintessential forms (A sia),65 But in order
to endure this type of extreme pessimism (it can be perceived here
and there in my Birth of Tragedy) and to live alone “without God
and morality” I had to invent a counterpart for myself. Perhaps I
know best why man alone laughs: he alone suffers so deeply that
he had to invent laughter. The unhappiest and most melancholy
animal is, as fitting, the most cheerful.
92 ( 1883-1888)
Regarding German culture, I have always had the feeling of
decline. This fact, that I first became acquainted with a type in
decline, has often made me unfair to the whole phenomenon of
European culture. The Germans always come after the others,
much later: they are carrying something in the depths; e.g.,—
Dependence on other countries; e.g., Kant—Rousseau, Sen­
sualists, Hume, Swedenborg.
Schopenhauer—Indians and romanticism, Voltaire.

Than a sentimental bore.
Nietzsche omitted the text of this verse, which was inserted in the book

“ According to 1911, p. 499, the MS continued at this point: “Among
those thinkers who developed pessimism further I do not include Eduard
von Hartmann whom Fd far sooner lump with ‘agreeable literature*. . . .**
This was presumably omitted in the 1906 edition because Hartmann, born
in 1842 (two years before Nietzsche), did not die until 1906; but although
the passage was printed in the notes at the end of the 1911 volume, it was
omitted in all subsequent editions.

Renaissance and Reformation.— What does the Renaissance
prove? That the reign of the individual has to be brief. The
squandering is too great; the very possibility of collecting and
capitalizing is lacking; and exhaustion follows immediately. These
are times when everything is spent, when the very strength is spent
with which one collects, capitalizes, and piles riches upon riches.—
Even the opponents of such movements are forced into an absurd
waste of energy; they, too, soon become exhausted, spent, desolate.
In the Reformation we possess a wild and vulgar counterpart
to the Italian Renaissance, born of related impulses; only in the
retarded north, which had remained coarse, they had to don a
religious disguise; for there the concept of the higher life had not
yet detached itself from that of the religious life.
Through the Reformation, too, the individual sought freedom;
“everybody his own priest” is also a mere formula of libertinage.
In truth, one word was enough— “evangelical freedom”— and all
instincts that had reason to remain hidden broke out like wild dogs,
the most brutal requirements suddenly acquired the courage to face
themselves, and everything seemed justified.— One was careful not
to understand what liberty one had really meant at bottom; one
shut one’s eyes before oneself.— But shutting one’s eyes and
moistening one’s lips with enthusiastic orations did not prevent
one’s hands from grasping whatever could be grabbed, and the
belly became the god of the “free evangel,” and all the cravings of
revenge and envy satisfied themselves with insatiable rage.—
This took a while; then exhaustion set in, just as it had in the
south of Europe— and here, too, a vulgar kind of exhaustion, a
general ruere in servitium.BT— The indecent century of Germany

Chivalry as the conquered position of power: its gradual
breaking up (and in part transition into what is more spread out,
bourgeois). In La Rochefoucauld we find a consciousness of the
true motive springs of noblesse of the mind— and a view of these
motive springs that is darkened by Christianity.

Then the slaves and Mrs. Beecher-Stowe. Then the poor and the

the foreground (even to develop sympathy for the genius one no
longer knows any other way for the past five hundred years than
to represent him as the bearer of great suffering!). Next come the
curse on voluptuousness (Baudelaire and Schopenhauer); the most
decided conviction that the lust to rule is the greatest vice;*3 the
perfect certainty that morality and disinterestedness are identical
concepts and that the “happiness of all” is a goal worth striving
for (i.e., the kingdom of heaven of Christ). We are well along on
the way: the kingdom of heaven of the poor in spirit has begun.—
Intermediary stages: the bourgeois (a parvenu on account of

Comparison of Greek culture and that of the French in the

behind the emphasis on forms. The delight in looking at a life that
seems so easy.— To the French, the Greeks looked like children.

The Three Centuries
Their different sensibilities are best expressed thus:
Aristocratism; Descartes, rule of reason, testimony of the
sovereignty of the will;
MCf. the chapter “On the Three Great Evils” in Zarathustra III (Porta­
ble Nietzsche, p. 298).

bo o k o n e : European Nihilism

59

Feminism: Rousseau, rule of feeling, testimony of the sover­
eignty of the senses, mendacious;
Animalism: Schopenhauer, rule of craving, testimony of the
sovereignty of animality, more honest but gloomy.
The seventeenth century is aristocratic, imposes order, looks
down haughtily upon the animalic, is severe against the heart, not
cozy, without sentiment, “un-German,” averse to what is burlesque
and what is natural, inclined to generalizations and sovereign con­
fronted with the past—for it believes in itself. Much beast of prey
au fond, much ascetic habit to remain master. The century of strong
will; also of strong passion.
The eighteenth century is dominated by woman, given to en­
thusiasm, full of esprit, shallow, but with a spirit in the service of
what is desirable, of the heart, libertine in the enjoyment of what
is most spiritual, and undermines all authorities; intoxicated, cheer­
ful, clear, humane, false before itself, much canaille au fond, socia­
ble.—
The nineteenth century is more animalic and subterranean,
uglier, more realistic and vulgar, and precisely for that reason
“better,” “more honest,” more submissive before every kind of
“reality,” truer; but weak in will, but sad and full of dark crav­
ings, but fatalistic. Not full of awe and reverence for either “reason”
or “heart”; deeply convinced of the rule of cravings (Schopenhauer
spoke of “will”; but nothing is more characteristic of his philosophy
than the absence of all genuine willing). Even morality reduced to
one instinct (“pity” ).
Auguste Comte is a continuation of the eighteenth century
(domination of coeur over la tite, sensualism in the theory of
knowledge, altruistic enthusiasm).
That science has become sovereign to such a degree proves
how the nineteenth century has rid itself of the domination of
ideals. A certain frugality of desire makes possible our scientific
curiosity and severity—which is our kind of virtue.—
Romanticism is an echo of the eighteenth century; a kind of
piled-high desire for its enthusiasm in the grand style (as a matter
of fact, a good deal of histrionics and self-deception: one wanted
to represent strong natures and grand passions).
The nineteenth century looks instinctively for theories that
seem to justify its fatalistic submission to matters of fact. Already
Hegel’s success against “sentimentality” and romantic idealism was
due to his fatalistic way of thinking, to his faith in the greater reason

60

TH E W I L L TO P O WE R

on the side of the victorious, to his justification of the actual “state”
(in place of “mankind,” etc.),—
Schopenhauer: we are something stupid and, at best, even
something that cancels itself.50 Success of determinism, of the
genealogical derivation of obligations that had formerly been con­
sidered absolute, the doctrine of milieu and adaptation, the reduc­
tion of will to reflexes, the denial of the will as an “efficient cause”;
finally— a real rechristening: one sees so little will that the word
becomes free to designate something else. Further theories: the
doctrine of objectivity— “will-less” contemplation— as the only
road to truth; also to beauty (— also the faith in the “genius” to
justify a right to submission); mechanism, the calculable rigidity
of the mechanical process; the alleged “naturalism,” elimination of
the choosing, judging, interpreting subject as a principle—
Kant, with his “practical reason” and his moral fanaticism is
wholly eighteenth century; still entirely outside the historical move­
ment; without any eye for the actuality of his time, e.g., Revolution;
untouched by Greek philosophy; fanciful visionary of the concept
of duty; sensualist with the backdrop of the pampering of dog­
matism.—
The movement back to Kant in our century is a movement
back to the eighteenth century: one wants to regain a right to the
old ideals and the old enthusiasm— for that reason an epistemology
that “sets boundaries,” which means that it permits one to posit
as one may see fit a beyond of reason,—
Hegel*s way of thinking is not far different from Goethe's:
one needs only to listen to Goethe about Spinoza, Will to deify the
universe and life in order to find repose and happiness in contem­
plation and in getting to the bottom of things; Hegel seeks reason
everywhere— before reason one may submit and acquiesce. In
Goethe a kind of almost joyous and trusting fatalism that does not
revolt, that does not flag, that seeks to form a totality out of him­
self, in the faith that only in the totality everything redeems itself
and appears good and justified.60
“ Etwas Sich-selbst~Aufhebendes. Aufheben, one of Hegel's favorite
terms, is an ordinary German word that can mean cancel, preserve, and
lift up. For a detailed discussion of this term see Walter Kaufmann, Hegel,
Doubleday, Garden City, 1965, sections 37 and 42.

Period of the Enlightenment—followed by the period of senti­
mentality. To what extent Schopenhauer belongs to “sentimentality”
(Hegel to spirituality).61
97 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The seventeenth century suffers of man as of a sum of contra­
dictions (“I’amas de contradictions’* that we are); it seeks to dis­
cover, order, excavate man—while the eighteenth century seeks to
forget what is known of man’s nature in order to assimilate him
to its utopia* “Superficial, tender, humane”— enthusiastic about
“man”—
The seventeenth century seeks to erase the tracks of the indi­
vidual to make the work look as similar to life as possible. The
eighteenth uses the work in an attempt to arouse interest in the
author. The seventeenth century seeks in art— art, a piece of cul­
ture; the eighteenth uses art to make propaganda for reforms of a
social and political nature.
“Utopia,” the “ideal man,” the deification 6f nature, the vanity
of posing, the subordination to propaganda for social goals, charla­
tanism— these are our gifts from the eighteenth century.
The style of the seventeenth century: propre3 exact et libre.
The strong individual, self-sufficient or zealously occupied
before God— and this modern obtrusiveness of authors who all
but leap out at you— these furnish some contrast. “To perform”
— compare that with the scholars of Port-Royal,
Alfieri62 had a sense for grand style.
Hatred of the burlesque (undignified), lack of a sense for
nature belong to the seventeenth century.

Against Rousseau.— Unfortunately, man is no longer evil
enough; Rousseau’s opponents who say “man is a beast of prey”
are unfortunately wrong. Not the corruption of man but the ex­
tent to which he has become tender and moralized is his curse.63

Precisely in the sphere that Rousseau fought most violently one
could find the relatively still strong and well-turned-out type of
man (those in whom the grand affects were still unbroken: will
to power, will to enjoyment, will and capacity to command). The
man of the eighteenth century has to be compared with the man
of the Renaissance (also with the man of the seventeenth century
in France), so that one feels what is at stake: Rousseau is a symp­
tom of self self-contempt and heated vanity—both signs that the
domineering will is lacking: he moralizes and, as a man of rancor,
seeks the cause of his wretchedness in the ruling classes.
99 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Against Rousseau.64— The state of nature is terrible, man is
a beast of prey; our civilization represents a tremendous triumph
over this beast-of-prey nature: thus argued Voltaire. He felt the
mitigation, the subtleties, the spiritual joys of the civilized state;
he despised narrowmindedness, also in the form of virtue, and
the lack of delicatesse, also among ascetics and monks.
The moral reprehensibility of man seemed to preoccupy
Rousseau; with the words “unjust” and “cruel” one can best stir
up the instincts of the oppressed who otherwise smart under the
ban of the vetitum and disfavor, so their conscience advises them
against rebellious cravings. Such emancipators seek one thing
above all: to giye their party the grand accents and poses of the
higher nature.
100 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Rousseau: the rule based on feeling; nature as the source of
justice; man perfects himself to the extent to which he approaches
nature (according to Voltaire, to the extent to which he moves
away from nature). The very same epochs are for one ages of the
progress of humanity; for the other, times when injustice and
inequality grow worse.
Voltaire still comprehended umanita in the Renaissance sense;
also virtii (as “high culture” ); he fights for the cause of the
“honnites gens" and "de la bonne compagnie/ ’*“ the cause of

taste, of science, of the arts, of progress itself and civilization.
The fight began around 1760: the citizen of Geneva and le
seigneur de Ferney.™ Only from that moment on Voltaire becomes
the man of his century, the philosopher, the representative of
tolerance and unbelief (till then merely un bel esprit)*1 Envy
and hatred of Rousseau’s success impelled him forward, “to the
heights.”
Pour "la. canaille” un dieu remunerateur et vengeur™—
Voltaire.
Critique of both points of view in regard to the value of
civilization. The social invention is for Voltaire the most beauti­
ful there is: there is no higher goal than to maintain and perfect
it; precisely this is honnheti
to respect social conventions;
virtue as obedience to certain necessary “prejudices” in favor of
the preservation of “society.” Missionary of culture, aristocrat,
representative of the victorious, ruling classes and their valuations.
But Rousseau remained a plebeian, also as homme de lettres;10
that was unheard of; his impudent contempt of all that was not
he himself.
What was sick in Rousseau was admired and imitated m ost
(Lord Byron related to him; also worked himself up into sublime
poses and into vindictive rancor; sign of “meanness”; later attained
balance through Venice and comprehended what produces more
ease and well-being—Vinsouciance.)71
Rousseau is proud in regard to what he is, in spite of his
origins; but he is beside himself when one reminds him of it.—
Rousseau, beyond a doubt, mentally disturbed; in Voltaire
an uncommon health and light touch. The rancor of the sick; the
periods of his insanity also those of his contempt of man and his
mistrust.
The defense of providence by Rousseau (against the pessimism
of Voltaire): he needed God in order to be able to cast a curse
upon society and civilization; everything had to be good in itself

and good society, but each of them has a distinctive flavor in the original
language, which accounts for Nietzsche's use of foreign words.

because God had created it; only man has corrupted men. The
“good man” as the natural man was pure fantasy; but with the
dogma of God’s authorship it seemed probable and well-founded.
Romanticism a la Rousseau: passion ( “the sovereign right
of passion” ); “naturalness”; the fascination of madness (folly
included in greatness); the absurd vanity of the weak man; the

has been accepted as a leader in politics”),72

Kant: makes the epistemological skepticism of the English
possible for Germans:
1. by enlisting for it the sympathy of the moral and religious
needs of the Germans; just as the later philosophers of the Academy
used skepticism for the same reason, as a preparation for Platonism
(vide Augustin); and as Pascal used even moralistic skepticism in
order to excite the need for faith ( “to justify it”);
2. by scholastically involuting and curlicueing it and thus
making it acceptable for the German taste regarding scientific form
(for Locke and Hume in themselves were too bright, too clear, i.e.,
judged according to German value instincts, “too superficial”— )
Kant: inferior in his psychology and knowledge of human
nature; way off when it comes to great historical values (French
Revolution); a moral fanatic a la Rousseau; a subterranean Chris­
tianity in his values; a dogmatist through and through, but ponder­
ously sick of this inclination, to such an extent that he wished to
tyrannize it, but also weary right away of skepticism; not yet
touched by the slightest breath of cosmopolitan taste and the beauty
of antiquity— a delayer and mediator, nothing original (just as
Leibniz mediated and built a bridge between mechanism and
spiritualism, as Goethe did between the taste of the eighteenth
century and that of the “historical sense” (which is essentially a
sense for the exotic), as German music did between French and
Italian music, as Charlemagne did between imperium Romanum
and nationalism— delayers par excellence.)1*

Giovanni (as Mendelssohn testifies, 1831); also Stendhal, who said
of himself: Combien de lieues ne ferais-je pas a pied, et a combien

Schiller— more precisely, how much “Thekla”82— there is in Beet­
hoven!
Schumann has in himself Eichendorff, Uhland, Heine, Hoff­

the romantic saga, the mystical catholicism of instinct, symbolism,
the “libertinism of passion” (Rousseau’s intent). The Flying Dutch­

Estimated merely for his value for Germany and German
culture, Richard Wagner remains a great question mark, perhaps
a German misfortune, in any case a destiny: but what does it mat­
ter? Isn’t he very much more than merely a German event? It even
seems to me that there is no place where he belongs less than
Germany: nothing was prepared for him there; his whole type
remains simply strange among Germans, odd, uncomprehended,
incomprehensible. But one is careful not to admit this to oneself:
for that one is too kindly, too square,85 too German. “Credo quia
absurdus est”:8Q that is what the German spirit wants and also
wanted in this case— and so it believes for the present whatever
Wagner wanted people to believe about him. The German spirit
has at all times lacked subtlety and divination in psychologicis.
Today, under the high pressure of fatherlandism and self-admira­
tion, it is visibly thickening and becoming coarser: how should it
be capable of coping with the problem of Wagner!—

So
far, the Germans are nothing, but they will become some­
thing; thus they have no culture yet—thus they cannot have any
culture yet. That is my proposition: let those who cannot help it
take offense.— So far they are nothing: that means, they are all
sorts of things. They will become something’: that means, they will
stop some day being all sorts of things. The latter is at bottom a
mere wish, scarcely a hope; fortunately, a wish on which one can
live, a matter of will, of work, of discipline, of breeding, as well as
a matter of annoyance,87 of desire, of missing something, of dis­
comfort, even of embitterment—in brief, we Germans desire some­
thing from ourselves that has not yet been desired from us—we
desire something more!
That this “German as he is not yet” deserves something better
than today’s German “Bildung”;** that all who are “in the process
of becoming” must be furious when they perceive some satisfaction
in this area, an impertinent “retiring on one’s laurels” or “selfcongratulation” : that is my second proposition on which I also
have not yet changed my mind.
109 (1885)
Principle: There is an element of decay in everything that char­
acterizes modem man: but close beside this sickness stand signs of
an untested force and powerfulness of the soul The same reasons
that produce the increasing smallness of man drive the stronger
and rarer individuals up to greatness.80

The early editors* intent in placing this note of 1885 after the preceding
note of 1888, by way of concluding a subsection (the subheads have been
dropped above), is palpable: one did not wish to conclude with a sharp
criticism of Germany and dredged up an older note in which Nietzsche had
identified himself with the Germans, at least to some extent. The published
statements of his last year speak for themselves: see The Case of Wagner
and the chapter on the Germans (p. 505 in Portable Nietzsche) in Twilight
of the Idols; also the chapter on The Case of Wagner in Ecce Homo.

Overall insight: the ambiguous character of our modern world
— the very same symptoms could point to decline and to strength.
And the signs of strength, of the attainment of majority, could be
misconstrued as weakness on the basis of traditional (residual)
negative emotional valuations. In brief, our feelings, as feelings
about values, are not up to date.
To generalize: feelings about values are always behind the
times; they express conditions of preservation and growth that
belong to times long gone by; they resist new conditions of existence
with which they cannot cope and which they necessarily misunder­
stand: thus they inhibit and arouse suspicion against what is new.—
111 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The problem of the nineteenth century. Whether its strong and
weak sides belong together? Whether it is all of one piece? Whether
the diverseness of its ideals and their mutual inconsistency are due
to a higher aim: as something higher?— For it could be the pre­
condition of greatness to grow to such an extent in violent tension.
Dissatisfaction, nihilism could be a good sign.
112 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Overall insight.— Actually, every major growth is accom­
panied by a tremendous crumbling and passing away: suffering,
the symptoms of decline belong in the times of tremendous
advances; every fruitful and powerful movement of humanity has
also created at the same time a nihilistic movement. It could be
the sign of a crucial and most essential growth, of the transition
to new conditions of existence, that the most extreme form of
pessimism, genuine nihilism, would come into the world. This I
have comprehended.

slowly created, “asceticism” ironice.tt0 One shrinks from extremes;
a certain confidence in the “right road” ;91 no enthusing; temporary
acclimatization to narrower values (like “fatherland,” like “scholar­
ship,” etc.).
Still, this whole picture would remain ambiguous: it could be
an ascending but also a descending movement of life.

114 (June 10, 1887)™
Actually, we have no longer such need of an antidote to the
first nihilism: life in our Europe is no longer that uncertain, capri­
cious, absurd. Such a tremendous increase in the value of man, the
value of trouble, etc,, is not so needful now; we can take a signifi­
cant decrease of this value, we may concede much absurdity and
caprice: the power man has attained now permits a demotion of
the means of breeding of which the moral interpretation was the
strongest. “God”’ is far too extreme a hypothesis.

until now*93
116 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

The inversion of the order of rank.— The pious counter­
feiters, the priests, afnong us become chandalas— they replace the
charlatans, quacks, counterfeiters, and wizards; we consider them
corrupters of the will, great slanderers of life on which they wish
to revenge themselves, rebels among the underprivileged. We have
turned the caste of servants, the Sudras, into our middle class, our
" Volk” [“people” ], those who make political decisions.04
On the other hand, the chandala of former times is at the top:
foremost, those who blaspheme God, the immoralists7 the nomads
of every type, the artists, Jews, musicians— at bottom, all disreputa­
ble classes of men—
We have raised ourselves to the level of honorable thoughts;
even more, we determine honor on earth, “nobility”— AU of us
are today advocates of life.— We immoralists are today the strong­
est power: the other great powers need us—we construe the world
in our image—
We have transferred the concept of the “chandala” to the
priests, teachers of a beyond, and the Christian society that is
grown together with them, as well as all who are of the same origin,
the pessimists, nihilists, romantics of pity, criminals, vice addicts—
the whole sphere in which the concept of “God” is imagined as a
savior—
We are proud of no longer having to be liars, slanderers, men
who cast suspicion on life— 95

An exceptionally interesting note, though of course no more than a
note. Vermenschlichung, our becoming more humane, is the only thing
worthy of being considered genuine progress, and it consists in spiritualizing
(vergeistigen) the senses instead of condemning them as evil. The naivete
of postulating opposites where in fact there are only differences in degree is
also condemned in Nietzsche’s books, e.g., in Beyond Good and Evil, section
24 (New York: Vintage, 1966). For the final remark, see the chapter “On
the Three Evils” in Zarathustra, Part 111, p. 300 ff in Portable Nietzsche.
MAt this point the MS continued, according to 1911, p. 500, although
the standard editions omit the following words: “business and land owners—
the military—the scholarly classes.**
95In the ancient Hindu Law of Manu the priestly caste (Brahmins) is
the highest, the Sudras form the lowest caste, and the chandalas are out­
casts. For Nietzsche’s critique of the Law of Manu see the chapter on ‘The

Progress of the nineteenth century against the eighteenth
(— at bottom we good Europeans wage a war against the eighteenth
century— ):
1. “Return to nature” understood more and more decisively
in the opposite sense from Rousseau’s. A way from idyl and
opera!
2. more and more decisively anti-idealistic, more concrete,
more fearless, industrious, moderate, suspicious against
sudden changes, antirevolutionary',
3. more and more decisively the question
concerning the
health of the body is put ahead of that of “the soul” : the
latter being understood as a state consequent upon the
former, and the former at the very least as a precondition
of the health of the soul.
118 (1883-1888)
If anything at all has been achieved, it is a more innocuous
relation to the senses, a more joyous, benevolent, Goethean atti­
tude toward sensuality; also a prouder feeling regarding the search
for knowledge, so that the “pure fool”97 is not given much credit.
119 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. 1888)
We who are "objective ”— It is not “pity” that opens the
gates to the most distant and strange types of being and culture to
us, but rather our accessibility and lack of partiality that does not
empathize with or share suffering98 but on the contrary takes delight
in a hundred things that formerly led people to suffer (feel outraged
or deeply moved, or prompted hostile and cold looks— ). Suffer­
ing in all its nuances has become interesting for us: in this respect
this note two terms Gide used in book titles occur together: The Immoralist
and The Counterfeiters. The former was published before this note, but in­
fluenced by Nietzsche's use of the same term elsewhere,

we are certainly not fuller of pity, even when we are shaken by the
sight of suffering and moved to tears: we do not by any means for
that reason feel like helping.
In this voluntary desire to contemplate all sorts of distress and
transgressions 99 we have become stronger and more vigorous than
the eighteenth century was; it is a proof of our increase in vigor
(we have come closer to the seventeenth and sixteenth centuries— ).
But it is a profound misunderstanding to construe our “roman­
ticism” as a proof that our “souls” have become “more beautiful”—
We desire strong sensations as all coarser ages and social
strata do.— This should be distinguished from the needs of those
with weak nerves and the decadents: they have a need for pepper,
even for cruelty—
All of us seek states in which bourgeois morality no longer
has any say, and priestly morality even less (— every book to
which some of the air of pastors and theologians still clings gives
us the impression of a pitiable niaiserie100 and poverty.— “Good
society” consists of those whom at bottom nothing interests except
what is forbidden in bourgeois society and gives a bad reputation:
the same applies to books, music, politics, and the estimation of
woman.
120 (Sprifig-Fall 1887)
How man has become more natural in the nineteenth century
(the eighteenth century is that of elegance, refinement, and senti­
ments ginireux).— Not “return to nature”—for there has never
yet been a natural humanity. The scholasticism of un- and antinatural values is the rule, is the beginning; man reaches nature only
after a long struggle— he never “returns”— Nature: i.e., daring to
be immoral like nature.
We are coarser, more direct, full of irony against generous
feelings even when we succumb to them.
More natural is our first society, that of the rich, the leisure
class: they hunt each other, love between the sexes is a kind of
sport in which marriage furnishes an obstacle and a provocation;
they amuse themselves and live for pleasure; they esteem physical
advantages above all, are curious and bold.
” Vergehen could also mean "passing away” instead of “transgressions.”
*" Silliness.

74

T H E W I L L TO P O WE R

More natural is our attitude to the search for knowledge: we
possess libertinage of the spirit in all innocence, we hate pompous
and hieratical manners, we delight in what is most forbidden, we
should hardly know any longer of any interest of knowledge if the
way to it were paved with boredom.
More natural is our attitude toward morality. Principles have
become ridiculous; nobody permits himself any longer to speak
without irony of his “duty.” But a helpful, benevolent disposition
is esteemed (morality is found in an instinct, and the rest is
spumed.101 In addition a few concepts of points of honor— ).
More natural is our position in politicis: we see problems of
power, of one quantum of power against another. We do not believe
in any right that is not supported by the power of enforcement: we
feel all rights to be conquests.
More natural is our estimation of great human beings and
great things: we consider passion a privilege, we consider nothing
great unless it includes a great crime; we conceive all being-great
as a placing-one self-outside as far as morality is concerned.
More natural is our attitude toward nature: we no longer love
it on account of its “innocence,” “reason,” or “beauty” ; we have
made it nicely “devilish” and “dumb.” But instead of despising it
on that account, we have felt more closely related to it ever since,
more at home in it. It does not aspire to virtue, and for that we
respect nature.
More natural is our attitude toward art: we do not demand
beautiful illusory lies from it, etc.; brutal positivism reigns, recog­
nizing facts without becoming excited.
In summa: there are signs that the European of the nineteenth
century is less ashamed of his instincts; he has taken a goodly step
toward admitting to himself his unconditional naturalness, i.e., his
immorality, without becoming embittered—on the contrary, strong
enough to endure only this sight.
This sounds to some ears as if corruption had progressed—
and it is certain that man has not come close to that "nature" of
which Rousseau speaks but has progressed another step in civiliza­
tion, which Rousseau abhorred. We have become stronger: we have
again come closer to the seventeenth century, especially to the
taste of its end (Dancourt, Lesage, Regnard).102

Culture contra civilization.10S— The high points of culture
and civilization do not coincide: one should not be deceived about
the abysmal antagonism of culture and civilization. The great mo­
ments of culture were always, morally speaking, times of corrup­
tion; and conversely, the periods when the taming of the human
animal ( “civilization” ) was desired and enforced were times of
intolerance against the boldest and most spiritual natures. Civiliza­
tion has aims different from those of culture— perhaps they are
even opposite—
122 (January-Fall 1888)
What I warn against: the instincts of decadence should not be
confused with humaneness;104
the means of civilization, which lead to disintegration and
necessarily to decadence, should not be confused with
culture;
the libertinage, the principle of “laisser aller,” should not
be confused with the will to power (—which is the coun­
terprinciple).
123 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The unfinished problems I pose anew: the problem of civiliza­
tion, the fight between Rousseau and Voltaire around 1760. Man
becomes more profound, mistrustful, “immoral,” stronger, more
confident of himself— and to this extent “more natural” : this is
“progress.”— At the same time, in accordance with a kind of divi­
sion of labor, the strata that have become more evil are separated
from those that have becomc milder and tamer— so that the overall
fact is not noticed immediately.— It is characteristic of strength, of
the self-control and fascination of strength, that these stronger
strata possess the art of making others experience their progress in

To give men back the courage to their natural drives—
To check their self-underestimation (not that of man as an

To remove antitheses from things after comprehending that

Progress toward “naturalness” : in all political questions, also
in the relations of parties, even of commercial, workers’, and em­
ployers’ parties, questions of power are at stake— “what one can
do,” and only after that what one ought to do.105
1WPodach, op. cii., pp. 203 ff, says of Schlechta’s edition that “some
most important points have eluded him. Only two examples:
I. In the one-volume edition of The Will to Power [1901], the aphorism
to which Nietzsche assigned number 80 in W. II 1, 47/48 [the reference is
to pp. 47/48 of one of his notebooks], was reproduced as aphorism 36.
Weiss [in the two-volume edition of 1911, which—except for the important
editorial apparatus at the end of the second volume—is merely a reprint of
the second edition of 1906] made two [aphorisms] out of it (117 and 124),
although Nietzsche had also listed this aphorism in W II 4 as *80: Progress
of the growing naturalness of the nineteenth century.’ A juxtaposition of the
two versions shows that in 124 in Weiss’s version the paragraph is missing
that in the one-volume edition concludes the aphorism:
'that meanwhile, in the midst of the mechanics of grand politics, the Chris­
tian trumpet is still sounded (for example, in bulletins about victories or
in the Kaiser*s addresses to the nation), belongs more and more with the
things that are becoming impossible; for it of}ends good taste/
“Schlechta knows nothing of this, although it would have been useful
to him in his reprint. It is equally unknown to him that the editors of The
Will to Power of 1901 recorded in their notes (p. 131 [actually, 531]): ‘A
short sentence has been omitted here.’ Otto Weiss did not mention this.
“The unpublished sentence reads: ‘The throat of the crown prince is
not one of God’s affairs.’ ”
This is scarcely an earth-shaking revelation. Indeed, it is of interest
mainly as negative evidence: this is offered as one of the two “most impor­
tant points”— Wichtigstes might also be rendered as “most significant”—
that have eluded Podach’s predecessors down to Schlechta. Podach’s second
example has already been considered in the footnote to section 2. (See also
my article, cited at the end of that note.)
The “unpublished sentence” was evidently written in 1887, when the
crown prince of Germany was suffering from a throat ailment that killed
him a hundred days after he succeeded to the imperial throne in 1888. In
his correspondence Nietzsche then expressed his respect for him and his

Socialism— as the logical conclusion of the tyranny of the
least and the dumbest, i.e., those who are superficial, envious, and
three-quarters actors— is indeed entailed by “modern ideas” and
their latent anarchism; but in the tepid air of democratic well-being
the capacity to reach conclusions, or to finish, weakens. One follows
— but one no longer sees what follows* Therefore socialism is on
the whole a hopeless and sour affair; and nothing offers a more
amusing spectacle than the contrast between the poisonous and
desperate faces cut by today’s socialists— and to what wretched
and pinched feelings their style bears witness!— and the harmless
lambs’ happiness of their hopes and desiderata* Nevertheless, in
many places in Europe they may yet bring off occasional coups and
attacks: there will be deep “rumblings” in the stomach of the next
century, and the Paris commune, which has its apologists and advo­
cates in Germany, too, was perhaps no more than a minor indiges­
tion compared to what is coming* But there will always be too
many who have possessions for socialism to signify more than an
attack of sickness— and those who have possessions are of one
mind on one article of faith: “one must possess something in order
to be something.” But this is the oldest and healthiest of all in­
stincts: I should add, “one must want to have more than one has
in order to become more*” For this is the doctrine preached by
life itself to all that has life: the morality of development. To have
and to want to have more—growth, in one word—that is life itself.
In the doctrine of socialism there is hidden, rather badly, a “will
to negate life”; the human beings or races that think up such a
doctrine must be bungled. Indeed, I should wish that a few great
experiments might prove that in a socialist society life negates itself,
cuts of! its own roots. The earth is large enough and man still
sufficiently unexhausted; hence such a practical instruction and
disappointment—Friedrich III was a more likable emperor than his son and
successor, Wilhelm II. The “unpublished sentence*’ clearly was not closely
related to the contents of either section 117 or section 124 but merely a
note Nietzsche had jotted down for himself, and posterity was not cheated
by its suppression. It was evidently no more than a reaction to someone
who had dragged in God in a way that had irritated Nietzsche.

TO P O W E R

demonstratio ad absurdum would not strike me as undesirable,
even if it were gained and paid for with a tremendous expenditure
of human lives. In any case, even as a restless mole under the soil
of a society that wallows in stupidity, socialism will be able to be
something useful and therapeutic: it delays “peace on earth” and
the total mollification of the democratic herd animal; it forces the
Europeans to retain spirit, namely cunning and cautious care, not
to abjure manly and warlike virtues altogether, and to retain some
remnant of spirit, of clarity, sobriety, and coldness of the spirit—
it protects Europe for the time being from the marasmus101 femininus that threatens it.
126 (iSpring-Fall 18S7)
The most favorable inhibitions and remedies of modernity:
1. universal military service with real wars in which the time for
joking is past;
2. national bigotry (simplifies, concentrates);
3. improved nutrition (m eat);
4. increasing cleanliness and healthfulness of domiciles;
5. hegemony of physiology over theology, moralism, economics,
and politics;
6. military severity in the demand for and handling of one’s
“obligations” (one does not praise any more— ).
127 (1884)
I am glad about the military development of Europe; also of
the internal states of anarchy: the time of repose and Chinese ossi­
fication, which Galiani predicted for this century, is over. Personal
manly virtu,los virtu of the body,100 is regaining value, estimation
becomes more physical, nutrition meatier. Beautiful men are again
becoming possible. Pallid hypocrisy (with mandarins at the top,
as Comte dreamed) is over. The barbarian in each of us is affirmed;
also the wild beast. Precisely for that reason philosophers have a

I have as yet found no reason for discouragement. Whoever
has preserved, and bred in himself, a strong will, together with an
ample spirit, has more favorable opportunities than ever. For the
trainability of men has become very great in this democratic
Europe; men who learn easily and adapt themselves easily are the
rule; the herd animal, even highly intelligent, has been prepared.
Whoever can command finds those who must obey: I am thinking,
e.g., of Napoleon and Bismarck. The rivalry with strong and un­
intelligent wills, which is the greatest obstacle, is small. Who doesn’t
topple these “objective” gentlemen with weak wills, like Ranke or
Renan!
129 (1885)
Spiritual enlightenment is an infallible means for making men
unsure, weaker in will, so they are more in need of company and
support—in short, for developing the herd animal in man. There­
fore all great artists of government so far (Confucius in China, the
imperium Romanum, Napoleon, the papacy at the time when it
took an interest in power and not merely in the world), in the
places where the dominant instincts have culminated so far, also
employed spiritual enlightenment— at least let it have its way (like
the popes of the Renaissance). The self-deception of the mass con­
cerning this point, e.g., in every democracy, is extremely valuable:
making men smaller and more governable is desired as “progress”!

Your equity, you higher natures, impels you toward suffrage universel, etc.; your “humanity,” toward mildness confronted with

Good Europeans that we are— what distinguishes us above

fall into our hands, that must desire our hands.
Beyond good and evil— but we demand that herd morality
should be held sacred unconditionally.
We hold in reserve fnaiiy types of philosophy which need to
be taught: possibly, the pessimistic type, as a hammer; a European
Buddhism might perhaps be indispensable.
We probably support the development and maturing of demo­

We take our accidental positions (like Goethe, Stendhal),
our experiences, as foreground and stress them to deceive about our
depths. We ourselves are waiting and beware of staking our hearts
on them. They serve us as hostels for a night, which a wanderer
needs and accepts— we beware of settling down.

CRITIQUE OF THE HIGHEST
VALUES HITHERTO

I. CRITIQUE OF RELIGION1
All the beauty and sublimity we have bestowed upon real and
imaginary things I will reclaim as the property and product of
man: as his fairest apology. Man as poet, as thinker, as God, as
love, as power: with what regal liberality he has lavished gifts
upon things so as to impoverish himself and make himself feel
wretched! His most unselfish act hitherto has been to admire and
worship and to know how to conceal from himself that it was he
who created what he admired.— 2

1. Genesis of Religions
135 CMarch-June 1888)
On the origin of religion.— In the same way as today the un­
educated man believes that anger is the cause of his being angry,
spirit the cause of his thinking, soul the cause of his feeling— in
short, just as there is still thoughtlessly posited a mass of psy­
chological entities that are supposed to be causes— so, at a yet
more naive stage, man explained precisely the same phenomena
with the aid of psychological personal entities. Those conditions
that seemed to him strange, thrilling, overwhelming, he interpreted
as obsession and enchantment by the power of a person. (Thus
the Christian, the most naive and backward species of man today,
traces hope, repose, the feeling of “redemption,” back to psy­
chological inspiration by God: to him, as an essentially suffering
and disturbed type, the feeling of happiness, resignation and
repose naturally seems strange and in need of explanation.)
Among intelligent, strong, and vigorous races it is mainly the
epileptic who inspires the conviction that a strange power is here
at work; but every related condition of subjection, e.g., that of
the inspired man, of the poet, of the great criminal, of passions
such as love and revenge, also leads to the invention of extra­

ing passages in these two books have not been indicated specifically in the

human powers. A condition is made concrete in a person, and
when it overtakes us is thought to be effected by that person. In
other words: In the psychological concept of God, a condition,
in order to appear as effect, is personified as cause.
The psychological logic is this: When a man is suddenly and
overwhelmingly suffused with the feeling of power—and this is
what happens with all great affects— it raises in him a doubt about
his own person: he does not dare to think himself the cause of
this astonishing feeling— and so he posits a stronger person, a
divinity, to account for it.
In summa: the origin of religion lies in extreme feelings of
power which, because they are strange, take men by surprise:
and like a sick man who, feeling one of his limbs uncommonly
heavy, comes to the conclusion another man is lying on top of
him, the naive homo religiosus3 divides himself into several persons.
Religion is a case of "alteration de la p e r s o n a lity A sort of feel­
ing of fear and terror at oneself— But also a feeling of extraor­
dinary happiness and exaltation— Among the sick the feeling
of health is sufficient to inspire belief in God, in the nearness of
God.
136 (March-June 1888)
Rudimentary psychology of the religious man:— A11 changes
are effects; all effects are effects of will (—the concept “nature,”
“law of nature” is lacking); all effects suppose an agent. Rudi­
mentary psychology: one is a cause oneself only when one knows
that one has performed an act of will.
Result: when man experiences the conditions of power, the
imputation is that he is not their cause, that he is not responsible
for them: they come without being willed, consequently we are
not their author: the will that is not free (i.e., the consciousness
that we have been changed without having willed it) needs an
external will.
Consequence: man has not dared to credit himself with all
his strong and surprising impulses— he has conceived them as
“passive,” as “suffered,” as things imposed upon him: religion is
the product of a doubt concerning the unity of the person, an
alteration of the personality: in so far as everything great and
’ Religious man.

strong in man has been conceived as superhuman and external,
man has belittled himself—he has separated the two sides of him­
self, one very paltry and weak, one very strong and astonishing,
into two spheres, and called the former “man,” the latter “God.”
He has continued to think in this way; in the period of the
moral idiosyncrasy he did not interpret his exalted and sublime
moral states as “willed,” as “work” of the person. The Christian
too divides his person into a mean and weak fiction which he calls
man, and another which he calls God (redeemer, savior)—
Religion has debased the concept “man” ; its ultimate con­
sequence is that everything good, great, true is superhuman and
bestowed only through an act of grace—
137 (March-June 1888)
One way of raising man from the abasement produced by
the subtraction of exalted and strong states as foreign conditions
was the family theory. These exalted and strong states could at
least be interpreted as the influence of our ancestors; we belonged
together, in solidarity; we grow greater in our own eyes when we
act according to a norm known to us.
Attempt by noble families to square religion with the feeling
of their own worth. Poets and seers do the same: they feel proud,
honored, and chosen for such an association— they attach great
importance to not being considered at all as individuals, but merely
as mouthpieces (Homer).
Step by step man takes possession of his exalted and proud
states, he takes possession of his acts and works. Formerly one
believed one was doing oneself an honor by denying responsibility
for one’s highest acts and attributing them to—God. Absence of
free will counted as that which imparted a higher value to an
action: a god was conceived as its author.4

ideals, gods, or saviors: in this they find their calling, for this their
instincts serve them; to make everything as believable as possible
they have to go as far as possible in posturing and posing; the
shrewdness of their actor’s art must above all aim at giving them a
good conscience, by means of which alone is it possible to carry
true conviction.
139 {March-June 1888)
The priest wants to have it understood that he counts as the
highest type of man, that he rules—even over those who wield
power—that he is indispensable, unassailable— that he is the
strongest power in the community, absolutely not to be replaced
or undervalued.
Means:5 he alone possesses knowledge; he alone possesses
virtue; he alone has sovereign lordship over himself; he alone is
in a certain sense God and goes back to the divinity; he alone
is the intermediary between God and other people; the divinity
punishes every opposition to, every thought directed against a
priest.
Means: truth exists. There is only one way of attaining it:
to become a priest. Everything good in society, in nature, in tra­
dition, is to be traced back to the wisdom of the priests. The holy
book is their work. The whole of nature is only a fulfillment of the
dogmas contained in it. There is no other source of the good
than the priests. Every other kind of excellence is of a different
order from that of the priest; e.g., that of the warrior.
Consequence: if the priest is to be the highest type, then the
degrees which lead to his virtues must constitute the degrees of
value among men. Study, emancipation from the senses, the non­
active, the impassible, absence of affects, the solemn; antithesis:
the lowest order of man.
The priest has taught one kind of morality: in order that he
shall be considered the highest type of man. He conceives an
antithetical type: the chandala. To make these contemptible by
every means provides a foil to the order of castes.— The priest’s
extreme fear of sensuality is also conditioned by the insight that
this is the most serious threat to the order of castes (that is, to
order, in general)— Every “more liberal tendency” in puncto
puncti throws the marriage laws overboard—
*Mittel, i.e., means in the sense of instrument.

The philosopher as a further development of the priestly
type:— has the heritage of the priest in his blood; is compelled,
even as rival, to struggle for the same ends with the same means
as the priest of his time; he aspires to supreme authority.
What gives authority when one does not have physical
power in one’s hands (no army, no weapons of any kind— )?
How, in fact, does one gain authority over those who possess
physical strength and authority? (They compete with the awe
inspired by princes, by the victorious conqueror, by the wise
statesman).
Only by arousing the belief that they have in their hands a
higher, mightier strength— God. Nothing is sufficiently strong:
the mediation and service of the priests is needed. They establish
themselves as indispensable intermediaries: they need as condi­
tions of their existence: (1) belief in the absolute superiority of
their God, belief in their God; (2) that there is no other, no direct
access to God, The second demand alone creates the concept
“heterodoxy,” the first the concept “unbeliever” (i.e., one who
believes in another God— ),
141° (Jan.-Fall 1888)
Critique of the holy lie.— That the lie is permitted as a means
to pious ends is part of the theory of every priesthood— to what
extent it is part of their practice is the object of this inquiry.
But philosophers too, as soon as, with priestly ulterior mo­
tives, they form the intention of taking in hand the direction of
mankind, at once also arrogate to themselves the right to tell lies:
Plato before all. The most imposing is the twofold lie developed
by the typically Aryan philosophers of the Vedanta: two systems
contradictory in all their main features but for educational reasons
alternating, supplementary and complementary. The lie of the one
is intended to create a condition in which alone the truth of the
other can become audible—
How far does the pious lie of priests and philosophers go?—
One must ask what presuppositions they require for the purpose
*

Mankind” in Twilight (Portable Nietzsche).

of education, what dogmas they have to invent to satisfy these
presuppositions.
First: they must have power, authority, unconditional credi­
bility on their side.
Secondly: they must have the whole course of nature in their
hands, so that everything that affects the individual seems to be
conditioned by their laws.
Thirdly: they must also possess a more extensive domain of
power whose control eludes the eyes of its subjects: power of
punishment in the beyond, in the “after death”— and of course
the means of discovering the way to bliss.
— They have to set aside the concept of a natural course of
events: but since they are clever and thoughtful people they are
able to promise a host of effects, conditioned, of course, by prayers
or the strict observance of their laws.— They can, moreover,
prescribe a host of things that are absolutely reasonable—provided
only that they do not point to experience or empiricism as the
source of this wisdom, but to revelation or the consequence of
“the sternest penances.”
The holy lie therefore applies principally: to the purpose of
an action (— natural purpose, reason are made to vanish: a moral
purpose, the fulfillment of a law, a service to God appears as
purpose— ): to the consequence of an action (— natural conse­
quence is interpreted as supernatural and, to produce a surer
effect, the prospect of other, uncontrollable consequences is held
out).
In this way a concept of good and evil is created that seems
to be altogether divorced from the natural concept “useful,”
“harmful,” ‘'life-promoting,” “life-retarding”— in so far as another
life is imagined, it can even be directly inimical to the natural
concept of good and evil.
In this way the famous “conscience” is at last created: an
inner voice which does not measure the value of every action with
regard to its consequences, but with regard to its intention and
the degree to which this intention conforms with the “laws.”
The holy lie therefore invented ( 1 ) 7 a God who punishes and
rewards, who strictly observes the law-book of the priests and is
strict about sending them into the world as his mouthpieces and
plenipotentiaries; (2) an afterlife in which the great punishment

machine is first thought to become effective— to this end the
immortality of the soul; (3) conscience in man as the conscious­
ness that good and evil are permanent— that God himself speaks
through it when it advises conformity with priestiy precepts; (4 )
morality as denial of all natural processes, as reduction of all
events to a morally conditioned event, moral effects (i.e., the idea
of punishment and reward) as effects permeating all things, as the
sole power, as the creator of all transformation; (5 ) truth as given,
as revealed, as identical with the teaching of the priests: as the
condition for all salvation and happiness in this life and the next.
In summa: what is the price of moral improvement?— Un­
hinging of reason, reduction of all motives to fear and hope
(punishment and rew ard)‘/dependence upon a priestly guardian­
ship, upon pedantic formalities which claim to express a divine
will; the implanting of a “conscience” which sets a false knowing
in place of testing and experiment: as if what should be done
and what left undone had already been determined—a kind of
castration of the seeking and forward-striving spirit; in summa:
the worst mutilation of man that can be imagined presented as
the “good man.”
In practice, all the reason, the whole heritage of prudence,
subtlety, caution which is the presupposition of the priestly canon,
is afterwards arbitrarily reduced to a mere mechanism: conformity
with the law itself counts as an end, as the highest end, life no
longer has any problems; the whole conception of the world is
polluted by the idea of punishment; with the object of representing
the priestly life as the non plus ultra of perfection, life itself is
transformed into a defamation and pollution of life; the concept
“God” represents a turning away from life, a critique of life, even
a contempt for it; truth is transformed into the priestly lie, the
striving for truth into study of the scriptures, into a means of
becoming a theologian—

Toward a critique of the law-book of Manu.— The whole
book is founded on the holy lie. Was the well-being of mankind
the inspiration of this system? Was this species of man, who
believes in the interestedness of every action, interested or not in
imposing this system? To improve mankind—how is this inten­
tion inspired? Where is the concept of improvement derived from?

92

THE

WILL

TO P O W E R

We find a species of man, the priestly, which feels itself to
be the norm, the high point and the supreme expression of the
type man: this species derives the concept “improvement” from
itself. It believes in its own superiority, it wills itself to be superior
in fact: the origin of the holy lie is the will to power—
Establishment of rule: to this end, the rule of those concepts
that place a non plus ultra of power with the priesthood. Power
through the lie— in the knowledge that one does not possess it
physically, militarily— the lie as a supplement to power, a new
concept of “truth.”
It is a mistake to suppose an unconscious and naive develop­
ment here, a kind of self-deception— Fanatics do not invent such
carefully thought-out systems of oppression— The most cold­
blooded reflection was at work here; the same kind of reflection as
a Plato applied when he imagined his “Republic.” “He who wills
the end must will the means”— all lawgivers have been clear in
their minds regarding this politician’s insight.
We possess the classic model in specifically Aryan forms:
we may therefore hold the best-endowed and most reflective species
of man responsible for the most fundamental lie that has ever
been told— That lie has been copied almost everywhere: Aryan
influence has corrupted all the world— 8
143 (March-June 1888)
A lot is said today about the Semitic spirit of the New Testa­
ment: but what is called Semitic is merely priestly— and in the
racially purest Aryan law-book, in Manu, this kind of “Semitism,”
i.e., the spirit of the priest, is worse than anywhere else.
The development of the Jewish priestly state is not original:
they learned the pattern in Babylon: the pattern is Aryan. When,
later on, the same thing became dominant in a Europe with a
preponderance of Germanic blood, this was in accordance with
the spirit of the ruling race: a great atavism. The Germanic Middle
Ages aimed at a revival of the Aryan order of castes.
Mohammedanism in turn learned from Christianity: the em­
ployment of the “beyond” as an instrument of punishment.

Moralities and religions are the principal means by which one
can make whatever one wishes out of man, provided one possesses

What an affirmative Aryan religion, the product of the ruling
class, looks like: the law-book of Manu. (The deification of the
feeling of power in BnJima: interesting that it arose among the
warrior caste and was only transferred to the priests.)
What an affirmative Semitic religion, the product of a ruling
class, looks like: the law-book of Mohammed, the older parts of
the Old Testament. (Mohammedanism, as a religion for men, is
deeply contemptuous of the sentimentality and mendaciousness of
Christianity— which it feels to be a woman’s religion.)
What a negative Semitic religion, the product of an oppressed
class, looks like: the New Testament (— in Indian-Aryan terms:
a chandala religion).
What a negative Aryan religion looks like, grown up among
the ruling orders: Buddhism.
It is quite in order that we possess no religion of oppressed
Aryan races, for that is a contradiction: a master race is either on
top or it is destroyed.10

Pagan-Christian. The affirmation of the natural, the sense of
innocence in the natural, “naturalness,” is pagan. The denial of
the natural, the sense of degradation in the natural, unnaturalness,
is Christian.
Petronius, e.g., was “innocent” : compared with this happy
man, a Christian is absolutely without innocence. But since
ultimately the Christian status must be merely a natural condition
—which, however, dares not conceive itself to be such— “Chris­
tian” signifies raising to a principle the counterfeiting of psy­
chological interpretations—
148 (1883-1886)
The Christian priest is from the first a mortal enemy of sen­
suality: no greather antithesis can be imagined than the innocently
awed and solemn attitude adopted by, e.g., the most honorable
women’s cults of Athens in the presence of the symbols of sex.
The act of procreation is the mystery as such in all nonascetic re­
ligions: a sort of symbol of perfection and of the mysterious design
of the future: rebirth, immortality.

Belief in ourselves is the strongest fetter and the supreme

Religions are destroyed by belief in morality. The Christian
moral God is not tenable: hence “atheism”— as if there could be
no other kinds of god.
Similarly, culture is destroyed by belief in morality. For

it can grow, one no longer wants it (Buddhism).

c. the party of the politically weary and the indifferent (blase

sweetness and mildness— it is gratitude toward all that lies behind,
and also for what is lacking: bitterness, disillusionment, ran­
cor; finally, a lofty spiritual love; the subtleties of philosophical
contradiction are behind it, even from these it is resting: but from
these it still derives its spiritual glory and sunset glow. (— Origin

The Christian movement is a degeneracy movement com­
posed of reject and refuse elements of every kind: it is not the
expression of the decline of a race, it is from the first an agglomera­
tion of forms of morbidity crowding together and seeking one
another out— It is therefore not national, not racially conditioned;
it appeals to the disinherited everywhere; it is founded on a rancor
against everything well-constituted and dominant: it needs a symbol
that represents a curse on the well-constituted and dominant— It
also stands in opposition to every spiritual movement, to all
philosophy: it takes the side of idiots13 and utters a curse on the
spirit. Rancor against the gifted, learned, spiritually independent:
it detects in them the well-constituted, the masterful,

In Buddhism this thought predominates: “All desires, all
that produces affects and blood, draw one toward actions”— only
to this extent is one warned against evil. For action— has no mean­

They see in evil a drive toward something illogical: to the affirma­
tion of means to an end one denies. They seek a way of non­
existence and therefore they regard with horror all affective drives.
E.g., take no revenge! be no one’s enemy!— The hedonism of the
weary is here the supreme measure of value. Nothing is further
from Buddhism than the Jewish fanaticism of a Paul: nothing
would be more repellent to its instincts than this tension, fire, un­
rest of the religious man, above all that form of sensuality that
Christianity has sanctified with the name “love,” Moreover, it is
the cultured and even the overspirited orders that find satisfaction
in Buddhism: a race satiated and wearied by centuries of philo­
sophical contentions, not, however, beneath all culture, like the
classes from which Christianity arose— Emancipation even from
good and evil appears to be of the essence of the Buddhist ideal:

The entire Christian teaching as to what shall be believed,
the entire Christian “truth,” is idle falsehood and deception: and
precisely the opposite of what inspired the Christian movement in
the beginning.
Precisely that which is Christian in the ecclesiastical sense is
anti-Christian in essence: things and people instead of symbols;
history instead of eternal facts; forms, rites, dogmas instead of a
way of life. Utter indifference to dogmas, cults, priests, church,
theology is Christian.
The Christian way of life is no more a fantasy than the Bud­
dhist way of life: it is a means to being happy.
160 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
Jesus starts directly with the condition the “Kingdom of
Heaven” in the heart, and he does not find the means to it in
the observances of the Jewish church; the reality of Judaism itself
(its need to preserve itself) he regards as nothing; he is purely
inward.—
He likewise ignores the entire system of crude formalities
governing intercourse with God: he opposes the whole teaching of
repentance and atonement; he demonstrates how one must live in
order to feel “deified”—and how one will not achieve it through
repentance and contrition for one’s sins: “Sin is of no account”
is his central judgment.
Sin, repentance, forgiveness— none of this belongs here— it is
acquired from Judaism, or it is pagan.

Paul starts from the need for a mystery felt by the broad,
religiously excited masses: he seeks a sacrifice, a bloody phantas­
magoria which will stand up in competition with the images of
the mystery cults: God on the cross, blood-drinking, the urtio
mystica with the “sacrifice.”
He seeks to bring the afterlife (the blissful, atoned afterlife
of the individual soul) as resurrection into a causal relationship
with that sacrifice (after the type of Dionysus, Mithras, Osiris).
He needs to bring the concept guilt and atonement into the
foreground, not a new way of life (as Jesus himself had demon­
strated and lived) but a new cult, a new faith, a faith in a
miraculous transformation ( “redemption” through faith).
He understood what the pagan world had the greatest need
of, and from the facts of Christ’s life and death made a quite
arbitrary selection, giving everything a new accentuation, shifting
the emphasis everywhere— he annulled primitive Christianity as
a matter or principle—
The attempt to destroy priests and theologians culminated,
thanks to Paul, in a new priesthood and theology— in a new ruling
order and a church.
The attempt to destroy the exaggerated inflation of the
“person” culminated in faith in the “eternal person” (in concern
for “eternal salvation”— ), in the most paradoxical excess of
personal egoism*
This is the humor of the situation, a tragic humor: Paul re­
erected on a grand scale precisely that which Christ had annulled
through his way of living. At last, when the church was complete,
it sanctioned even the existence of the state.

THE WILL

TO P O W E R

The exemplary life consists of love and humility; in a fullness
of heart that does not exclude even the lowliest; in a formal re­
pudiation of maintaining one’s rights, of self-defense, of victory in
the sense of personal triumph; in faith in blessedness here on earth,
in spite of distress, opposition and death; in reconciliation; in the
absence of anger; not wanting to be rewarded; not being obliged
to anyone; the completest spiritual-intellectual independence; a
very proud life beneath the will to a life of poverty and service.
After the church had let itself be deprived of the entire Chris­
tian way of life and had quite specifically sanctioned life under
the state, that form of life that Jesus had combatted and con­
demned, it had to find the meaning of Christianity in something
else: in faith in unbelievable things, in the ceremonial of prayers,
worship, feasts, etc. The concept “sin,” “forgiveness,” “reward”
— all quite unimportant and virtually excluded from primitive
Christianity— now comes into the foreground.
An appalling mishmash of Greek philosophy and Judaism;
asceticism; continual judging and condemning; order of rank, etc.
170 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
Christianity has from the outset transformed the symbolic
into crudities:
1. the antithesis “real life” and “false” life: misunderstood
as “this life” and “the life to come” ;
2. the concept “eternal life,” the antithesis to transient
personal life, as “personal immortality”;
3. brotherhood on the basis of sharing food and drink to­
gether after the Hebrew-Arabic custom, as “the miracle of transubstantiation”;
4. “resurrection— ” understood as entry into “real life,” as
a state of “rebirth”; this is made into an historical eventuality
which takes place some time or other after death;
5. the teaching that the son of man is the “Son of God,” the
living relationship between God and man; this is made into the
“second person of the divinity”— the filial relationship to God of
every man, even the lowliest, is abolished;
6. salvation through faith (namely, that there is no means
of becoming a son of God except by following the way of life
taught by Christ) reversed into the faith that one is to believe
in some sort of miraculous subtraction of sins, accomplished not

through man but through Christ’s deed:
With that, “Christ on the cross” had to be interpreted anew.
This death in itself was not at all the main thing— it had been
only one more sign of how one ought to behave in relation to the
authorities and laws of this world: not to defend oneself— That
had been the lesson.
171 ( March-June 1888)
Toward a psychology of Paul— The given fact is the death
of Jesus. This has to be explained— That an explanation may be
true or false has never entered the minds of such people as these:
one day a sublime possibility comes into their heads: “this death
could mean such and such”— and at once it does mean such and
such! A hypothesis is proved true by the sublime impetus it
imparts to its originator—
“The proof of power” : i.e., an idea is proved true by its
effect— (“by their fruits” as the Bible naively says); what inspires
must be true— that for which one sheds one’s blood must be true—
Here, the sudden feeling of power that an idea arouses in its
originator is everywhere accounted proof of its value:— and since
one knows no way of honoring an idea other than by calling it true,
the first predicate with which it is honored is the predicate “true”—
How otherwise could it be so effective? It was imagined by some
power: if that power were not real, it could not be effective—
The idea is understood to have been inspired: the effect that it
exercises possesses something of the violence of a demonic in­
fluence—
An idea that such a decadent is unable to resist, to which he
completely succumbs, is thus “proved” true! ! J
None of these holy epileptics and seers of visions possessed
a thousandth part of that integrity in self-criticism with which a
philologist today reads a text or proves the truth of an historical
event— Compared with us, they are moral cretins— 22

effect it produces— absolute lack of intellectual integrity. Every­
thing is justified, lies, slander, the most shameless forgery, if it
serves to raise the temperature— until one “believes”—
A systematic school of the means to seduction to a faith:
contempt, on principle, for the spheres from which contradiction
might come (— the spheres of reason, philosophy and wisdom,
mistrust, caution); a shameless praising and glorification of the
doctrine, with constant reference to the fact that it was God who
gave it— that the apostle signifies nothing— that nothing here is to
be criticized, but only believed, accepted; that it is the most extra­
ordinary grace and favor to receive such a doctrine of redemption;
that the deepest gratitude and humility is the condition in which
to receive it—
The ressentiment which these lowly-placed persons feel toward
everything held in honor is constantly gambled upon: that one
represents this doctrine as a counterdoctrine in opposition to the
wisdom of the world, to the power of the world, seduces them to
it. It convinces the outcast and underprivileged of all kinds; it
promises blessedness, advantage, privilege to the most insignificant
and humble; it fills poor little foolish heads with an insane conceit,
as if they were the meaning and the salt of the earth—
All this, I repeat, one cannot sufficiently despise. We shall
spare ourselves a critique of the doctrine; it suffices to observe the
means it uses to know what it is one is dealing with. It identified
with virtue, it shamelessly claimed for itself alone the whole fascinat­
ing force of virtue— it identified with the power of paradox and
with the need felt by old civilizations for spice and absurdity; it
amazed, it enraged, it provoked persecution and mistreatment—
It is precisely the same well-pondered baseness with which
the Jewish priesthood established its power and the Jewish church
was created—
One should distinguish: (1) that warmth of the passion “love”
(resting on the subterranean basis of a heated sensuality); (2) the
absolute ignobility of Christianity: — the continual exaggeration,
the verbosity; — the lack of cool spirituality and irony; — the unmilitary nature of all its instincts; — the priestly prejudice against
manly pride, against sensuality, the sciences, the arts.23

Paul: he seeks power in opposition to ruling Judaism—his
movement is too weak-— Revaluation of the concept “Jew” : the
“race” is set aside-^-: but that means negating what is fundamental.
The “m artyr/’ the “fanatic,” the value of all strong faith—
Christianity is the decadent form of the old world sunk into
deepest impotence, so that the sickest and unhealthiest elements
and desires come to the top.
Consequently, in order to create a unity, a resisting power,
other instincts had to step into the foreground—in short, a kind
of calamity was needed such as that from which the Jews had
acquired their instinct for self-preservation-—
In this regard, the persecutions of the Christians were in­
valuable-—a sense of community in danger, mass-conversion as
the only means of putting an end to individual persecution (-^-con­
sequently he takes as lightly as possible the concept “conver­
sion”— ).
174 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
The Christian-Jewish life: here ressentiment did not pre­
dominate. Only the great persecutions could have developed this
passion to this extent— the ardor of love as well as that of hatred.
When one sees one’s dearest sacrificed for one’s faith, one
becomes aggressive; we owe the triumph of Christianity to its per­
secutors.
The asceticism in Christianity is not specifically Christian:
this is what Schopenhauer misunderstood: it only makes inroads
into Christianity wherever asceticism also exists apart from Chris­
tianity.
Hypochondriac Christianity, the torturing and vivisection of
the conscience, is in the same way only characteristic of a certain
soil in which Christian values have taken root: it is not Chris­
tianity itself. Christianity has absorbed diseases of all kiiids from
morbid soil: one can only reproach it for its inability to guard
against any infection. But that precisely is its essence: Christianity
is a type of decadence.

T H E W I L L TO P O W E R

175 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
The reality upon which Christianity could be raised was the
little Jewish family of the Diaspora, with its warmth and affection,
with its readiness to help and sustain one another— unheard-of
and perhaps not understood in the whole Roman Empire— with its
concealed, pride of the “chosen” disguised as humility, with its
innermost denial, untouched, by envy, of all that is on top and
possesses power and splendor. To have recognized in this a form
of power, to have recognized that this blissful condition was com­
municable, seductive, infectious to pagans also—that was Paul’s
genius: to employ this store of latent energy, of prudent happiness
for a “Jewish church of freer confession”— the entire Jewish ex­
perience and mastery of communal self-preservation under foreign
rule, also Jewish propaganda—he divined that as his task. What
he lit upon was just this absolutely unpolitical and withdrawn
species of little people: their art of asserting themselves and pre­
vailing, cultivated through a number of virtues which constituted
virtue in its entirety ( “means by which a particular species of man
preserves and enhances himself”).
The principle of love derives from the little Jewish communi­
ties: it is a soul of the more passionate kind that glows here under
the ashes of humility and wretchedness: this was neither Greek,
nor Indian, nor Germanic. The song in praise of love that Paul
composed24 is nothing Christian, but a Jewish outburst of the
eternal flame that is Semitic. If Christianity has done anything es­
sential psychologically, it is that ii raised the temperature of the
soul among those cooler and nobler races that were then on top;
it was the discovery that the most wretched life can become rich
and inestimable through a rise in temperature—
It goes without saying that such a transference could not take
place in respect to the ruling orders: the Jews and Christians had
their bad manners against them— and when allied to bad manners,
strength and passion of soul are repellent and almost disgusting
(— I see these bad manners whenever I read the New Testam ent).

lutionary at that time and constitutes a major contribution to our under­

One had to be related through lowliness and want to the type of
lowly people who spoke here to feel their attraction—
How one reacts to the New Testament is a test of whether
one has any classical taste in one’s bones (cf. Tacitus); whoever
is not revolted by it, whoever does not honestly and profoundly
sense something of foeda stiperstitio25 in it, something froin which
one withdraws one’s hand as if to avoid being soiled, does not
know what is classical. One must feel about the “cross” as Goethe

Reaction of the little people:-^ Love gives the greatest feeling
of power. To grasp to what extent not man in general but a certain
species of man speaks here. This is to be exhumed inore precisely.27
“We are divine through love, we become ‘children of God’;
God loves us and Wants nothing whatever from us save love” ; this
means: no morality, obedience, or activity produces that feeling of
power that love produces; one does nothing bad from love, one
does much more than one would do from obedience and virtue.
Here is the happiness of the herd, the feeling of community
in great and small things, the living feeling of unity experienced as
the sum Of the feeling of life. Being helpful and useful and caring
for others continually arouses the feeling of power; visible success,
the expression of pleasure underlines the feeling of power; pride is
not lacking, in the form of community, the abode of God, the
“chosen.”
What has in fact happened is that man has again experienced
an alteration of personality: this time he calls his feeling of love
God. One must picture to oneself what the awakening of such a
feeling is like: a kind of ecstasy, a strange language, a “gospel”—
it was this novelty that forbade him to ascribe love to himself— :
he thought God was walking before him and coming alive within
him.— “God descends to man,” one’s “neighbor” is transfigured
into a god (in so far as he arouses the feeling of love). Jesus is
“ “Abominable superstition.”

177 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
The faithful are conscious that they are endlessly indebted to
Christianity, and therefore conclude that its originator is a person­
age of the first rank— This conclusion is false, but it is typical of
conclusions drawn by worshipers. Objectively considered, it is pos­
sible, first, that they are in error about the value of that for which
they are indebted to Christianity: convictions prove nothing in
favor of that of which one: is convinced; in the case of religions
they establish rather a suspicion against it— It is possible, secondly,
that the debt to Christianity ought not to be ascribed to its founder
but to the finished structure, to the whole thing, the church, etc.
The concept “originator” is so, ambiguous it can even mean the
accidental cause of a movement: the figure of the founder has been
enlarged in proportion as the church has grown;: hut precisely this
perspective of worship permits the conclusion that at some time or
other this founder was something very uncertain and insecure, in
the beginning— Consider with what degree of freedom Paul treats,
indeed almost juggles with, the problem of the person of Jesus:
someone who died, who was seen again; after his death, who was
delivered over to death by the Jews— A mere “motif” : he then
wrote the music to it— A zero in the beginning.28

Herein lies the psychological difficulty that has hampered the under­

movement any possibility of success: it must conquer through ex­

Pretended youth. One is deceiving oneself if one imagines
here a naive and youthful people rising up against an ancient cul­

anew in those classes of the lowliest people where Christianity grew
and took root: ofie understands nothing of the psychology of Chris­
tianity if one takes it to be the expression of a newly arisen riational youthfulness and racial invigoration. Oil the contrary: it is
a typical form of decadence, the moral hypersensitivity and hysteria
of a sick mishmash populace grown weary and aimless. The ex­
traordinary company that here gathered around this master-seducer
really belongs wholly in a Russian novel: all the neuroses keep a
rendezvous in them—the absence of duties, the instinct that every­
thing is really coming to an end, that nothing is worth while any
more, contentment in a dolce far niente.29
The power and Certainty of the future in the Jewish instinct,
its tremendously tough will to exist and to power, lies in its ruling
classes: those orders which primitive Christianity raised up are
most clearly distinguished by the exhaustion of their instincts. On

1. As church (community) within the state, as an unpolitical
structure;
2. As life, discipline, practice, art of living;
3. As religion of sin (of transgression against God as the only
kind of transgression, as the sole cause of suffering in general),
with a universal cure for it. There are only sins against God; men
shall not judge acts done against men, nor demand a reckoning,
except in the name of God. Ditto, all commands (love): every­
thing is associated with God and done to man for God’s sake. A
higher prudence lies in this (— a very narrow life, as with the
Eskimos, is endurable only by the most peaceable and cautious
disposition: Jewish-Christian dogma turns against sin in favor of
the “sinner”— ).
182 (Spring-Fall 1S87)
The Jewish priesthood had understood how to present every­
thing which it claimed as a divine precept, as obedience to a com­
mand of God— also how to introduce whatever served to preserve
Israel and make possible its existence (e.g., a number of works:
circumcision, sacrificial cult as the center of national conscious­
ness) not as nature, but as “God,”— This process continued;
within Judaism, where the necessity for “works” was nOt felt (that
is to say, as a means of segregation from the outside world), a
priestly species of man could be conceived that behaved as the
“noble nature” behaves toward the aristocracy; a classless and at
the same time spontaneous priestliness of soul, which now, in order
to contrast itself sharply with its opposite, attached value not to
“works,” but to the “disposition”—
Fundamentally it was again the question of making a certain
species of soul prevail: as it were, a popular uprising within a
priestly people— a pietistic movement from below (sinners, publi­
cans, women, the sick). Jesus of Nazareth was the sign by which
they recognized themselves. And again, in order to believe in them­
selves they need a theological transfiguration: they require nothing
less than “the Son of God” to create a faith for themselves— And
just as the priesthood had falsified the entire history of Israel, so
again the attempt was here made to forge the history of mankind
in general, so that Christianity might appear to be its most cardinal
event. This movement could have arisen only on the soil of Juda­
ism, whose principal deed was to associate guilt with misfortune

this to the second power.

The Jews tried to prevail after they had lost two of their
castes, that of the warrior and that of the peasant; in this sense
they are the “castrated” : they have the priests— and then immedi­
ately the chandala—
As is only fair, a break develops among them, a revolt of
the chandala: the origin of Christianity.
Because they knew the warrior only as their master, they
brought into their religion enmity toward the noble, toward the
exalted and proud, toward power, toward the ruling orders— :
they are pessimists from indignation—
Thus they created an important new posture: the priest at
the head of the chandala—against the noble orders—
Christianity drew the ultimate conclusion of this movement:
even in the Jewish priesthood it still sensed caste, the privileged, the
noble— it abolished the priest—
The Christian is the chandala who repudiates the priest—the
chandala who redeems himself—
That is why the French Revolution is the daughter and con­
tinuation of Christianity—its instincts are against caste, against the
noble, against the last privileges-----185 (Spring-Fall 1887)

it God: the instinct for preservation in the least vital classes;

Artifice: to deny all natural mobilia and to transfer them to
the spiritual realm beyond—to exploit virtue and its veneration
entirely for one’s own ends, step by step to deny virtue to every­

186 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The profound contempt with which the Christian was treated
in the noble areas of classical antiquity is of a kind with the present
instinctive aversion to Jews: it is the hatred of the free and selfrespecting orders for those who are pushing and who combine
timid and awkward gestures with an absurd opinion of their worth.
The New Testament is the gospel of a wholly ignoble species

Take, on the other hand, a really pagan book, e.g., Petronius,
where fundamentally nothing is done, said, desired and valued but
what by peevish Christian standards is sin* mortal sin even. And
yet how pleasant is the purer air, the superior spirituality of its
quicker pace, the liberated and overflowing strength that feels sure
of the future! In the entire New Testament there is not one single

The Christians did as the Jews did and put into the mouth of
their master and encrusted his life with what they conceived to be
a condition of their existence and an innovation. At the same time
they restored to him all proverbial wisdom— : in short, they repre­
sented their actual life and activity as obedience and thus, as sancti­
fied for their propaganda.
What it all depends upon can be gathered from Paul: it is
not much; What remains is the elaboration of a type of saint on
the basis of what they considered holy.
The entire “miraculous doctrine,” including the resurrection,
is a consequence of self-glorification by the community, which
ascribed to its master in a higher degree whatever it thought itself
capable of (it derived its strength from him— ).

Christians have never put into practice the acts Jesus pre­

of existence resides in single highly tensed conditions of inactivity

this is Semitic. The Stoic is an Arabian sheik wrapped in Greek

Christianity only takes up the fight that had already begun
against the classical ideal and the noble religion.
In fact, this entire transformation is an adaption to the needs
and the level of understanding of the religious masses of that time:
those masses which believed in Isis, Mithras, Dionysus, the “Great
Mother,” and which desired of a religion: (1 ) hope of a beyond,
(2) the bloody phantasmagoria of the sacrificial animal (the mys­
tery), (3) the redemptive deed, the holy legend, (4) asceticism,
world-denial, superstitious “purification,” (5 ) a hierarchy, a form
of community. In short: Christianity accommodated itself to already
existing and established antipaganism, to the cults that had been
combatted by Epicurus— more precisely, to the religions of the
lower masses, the women, the slaves, the non-noble classes.
We therefore have the following misunderstandings:

Nothing is less innocent than the New Testament. One knows
from what soil it sprang. This people of an inflexible self-will
which knew how to prevail after it had lost every natural support
and had long since forfeited its right to existence, and to that end
had to raise itself up by unnatural, purely imaginary presupposi­
tions (as chosen people, as community of saints, as the people of
the promise, as “church”): this people handled the pia fraus33
with such perfection, such a degree of “good conscience,” that
one cannot be sufficiently cautious when it preaches morality. When
Jews step forward as innocence itself then the danger is great: one
should always have one’s little fund of reason, mistrust, and malice
to hand when one reads the New Testament,
People of the basest origin, in part rabble, outcasts not Only
from good but also from respectable society, raised away from
even the smell of culture, without discipline! without knowledge,
without the remotest suspicion that there is such a thing as con­
science in spiritual matters; simply— Jews: with an instinctive
ability to create an advantage, a means of seduction out of every
superstitious supposition, out of ignorance itself.34

However modest one may be in one’s demand for intellectual
cleanliness, one cannot help feeling, when coming into contact with
the New Testament, a kind of inexpressible discomfiture: for the
unchecked impudence with which the least qualified want to raise
their voice on the greatest problems, and even claim to be judges
of such things, surpasses all measure. The shameless levity with
which the most intractable problems (life* world, God, purpose
of life) are spoken of, as if they were not problems at all but
simply things that these little bigots knew!
202 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
This was the most fatal kind of megalomania there has ever
been on earth: when these lying little abortions of bigots began to
lay claim to the words “God,” “Last Judgment,” “truth,” “love,”
“wisdom,” “Holy Spirit” and with them made a boundary between
themselves and “the world” ; when this species of man began to
reverse values according to his own image, as if he were the mean­
ing, the salt, the measure, and the standard of all the rest— one
should have built madhouses for them and nothing more. That one
persecuted them was a piece of ancient folly in the grand manner:
that meant taking them too seriously, that meant making something
serious out of them.
The whole fatality was made possible by the presence in the
world already of a similar kind of megalomania, the Jewish (— once
the chasm had opened up between the Jews and the Christian-Jews,
the Christian-Jews had to employ once more and in an ultimate
intensification for their own self-preservation the self-preservative
procedures devised by the Jewish instinct— ) ; on the other hand,
Greek moral philosophy had already done everything to prepare
the way for and to make palatable moral fanaticism even among
Greeks and Romans— Plato, the great viaduct of corruption, who
first refused to see nature in morality, who had already debased
the Greek gods with his concept “good,” who was already marked
by Jewish bigotry (— in Egypt?)

On the denaturing of morality.— : These little herd-animal vir­
tues do not by any means lead to “eternal life” : to put them on
show in this way, and oneself with them, may be very clever, but
to him who keeps his eyes open even here, it remains in spite of
all the most ludicrous of all plays. One does not by any means
deserve a privileged position on earth and in heaven by attaining
perfection as a little, good-natured sheep; one remains at best a
little, good-natured, absurd sheep with horns—provided one does
not burst with vanity— as the court chaplains do35— or provoke
scandal by posing as a judge.
What a tremendous transfiguration of color here illumines the
little virtues—-as if they were the reflection of divine qualities!
The natural task and utility of every virtue is systematically
hushed up; it is of value only with reference to a divine command,
a divine model, only with reference to heavenly and spiritual goods.
(Magnificent: as if it had to do with “salvation of the soul” : but
it was a means of “enduring” things here with as many beautiful
feelings as possible.)
204 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
The law, the thoroughly realistic formalization of certain con­
ditions for the self-preservation of a community, forbids certain
actions directed to certain ends, namely those that are directed
against the community: it does not forbid the disposition that pro­
duces these actions—for it needs these actions for Other ends,
namely against the enemies of the community. Then the moral
idealist appears and says: “God beholds the heart: the action itself
is nothing; one must exterminate the aggressive disposition that
produces it— ” Under normal conditions one laughs at this; only
in those exceptional instances when a community lives absolutely
outside the necessity of waging war for its existence does one lend
an ear to such things. One abandons a disposition whose utility is
no longer apparent.
This was the case, e.g., when Buddha appeared amidst a very
peaceable and even spiritually exhausted community.
“ These words—a dig at Hofprediger Stocker, the leading German antiSemite of the time—are found only in 1911, p. 502. This is also true of the
title of this section. For Stocker see also 89 and 191 above.

THE

WILL

TO POWER

This was also the case with the earliest Christian community
(also Jewish community), whose presupposition is the absolutely
unpolitical Jewish society. Christianity could grow only in the soil
of Judaism, i.e., amidst a people that had already renounced poli­
tics arid lived a kind of parasitic existence within the Roman order
of things. Christianity is a step further on: one is even more free
to “emasculate” oneself—circumstances permit it.
One drives nature out of morality when one says “Love your
enemies” : for then the natural “Thou shalt love thy neighbor and
hate thy enemy” in the law (in instinct) has become meaningless;
then this love of one’s neighbor must also find a new basis (as a
kind of love of God). Everywhere, God is inserted and utility
withdrawn; everywhere the real origin of morality is denied: the
veneration of nature, which lies precisely in the recognition of a
natural morality, is destroyed at its roots—
Whence comes the seductive charm of Such an emasculated
ideal of man? Why aire we not disgusted by it as we are perhaps
disgusted by the idea of a castrato?— The answer lies precisely
here: the voice of a castrato does not disgust us, despite the cruel
mutilation that is its condition: it has grown sweeter— Just be­
cause the “male organ” has been amputated from virtue, a feminine
note has been brought to the voice of virtue that it did not have
before.
If we think, on the other hand, of the fearful hardship, danger,
and accidents that a life of manly virtue brings with it—the life
of a Corsican even today or that of the pagan Arab (which is
similar even in its details to the life of the Corsican: their songs
might have been written by Corsicans)—we grasp how precisely
the most robust kind of man is fascinated and affected by this lust­
ful note of “goodness,” of “purity”—- A shepherd’s song—an idyl
— the “good man” : these things produce the strongest effect in
ages when tragedy walks abroad.
*

But we have with this also recognized to what extent the
“idealist” (— ideal-castrato) also emerges from a quite definite
reality and is not merely a fantasist— he has arrived at the knowl­
edge that for his kind of reality such a coarse injunction forbidding
definite actions has no meaning (because the very instinct for these
actions has been weakened through long lack of practice, of need

book t w o :

121

for practice). The castrator formulates a number of new self­
preservative measures for men of a quite definite species: in this
he is a realist. His means of legislation are the same as those of
the older legislators: the appeal to authority of all kinds, to “God,”
the employment of the concept “guilt and punishment”—i,e., he
makes use of all the appurtenances of the older ideal, only in a
new interpretation, punishment, for example, made more inward
(perhaps as the pang of conscience).
In practice this species of man goes under as soon as the ex­
ceptional conditions of his existence cease— a kind of Tahiti and
island happiness, as in the life of the little Jews in the provinces.
Their only natural opponent is the soil from which they grew:
against this they need to fight, against this they must let the offen­
sive and defensive affects grow again: their opponents are the
adherents of the old ideal (— this species of enmity is championed
on a grand scale by Paul in relation to Judaism* by Luther in rela­
tion to the priestly-ascetic ideal). The mildest form of this oppo­
sition is certainly that of the early Buddhists: perhaps no greater
amount of work has been expended upon anything than upon
the discouragement and weakening of feelings of enmity* The fight
against ressentiment seems to be almost the first duty of the Bud­
dhist: only thus is peace of soul assured. To disengage oneself, but
without rancor: that presupposes, to be sure, an astonishingly mild
and sweet humanity— saints—

The prudence of moral castrationism.— How can one wage
war against the manly affects and valuations? One possesses no
means of physical force, one can wage only a war of cunning,
sorcery, lies, in short “of the spirit.”
First recipe: one claims virtue in general for one’s ideal; one
negates the older ideal to the point of presenting it as the antithesis
of all ideals. For this one employs an art of defamation.
Second recipe: one sets up one’s own type as the measure of
value in general; one projects it into things, behind things, behind
the fate of things— as God.
Third recipe: one sets up the opponent of one’s ideal as the
opponent of God; one fabricates for oneself the right to great
pathos, to power, to curse and to bless.
Fourth recipe: one derives all suffering, all that is uncanny,

122

THE

fearful and fateful in existence from opposition to one’s own ideal:
— all suffering is punishment, even in the case of one’s followers
(—unless it accompanies a test, etc.).
Fifth recipe: one goes so far as to conceive nature as the
antithesis of one’s own ideal; one regards it as a great test of
patience, as a sort of martyrdom to endure natural conditions for
very long; one practices dedain30 of mien and manners in respect
to all “natural things.”
Sixth recipe: the victory of unnaturalness, of the castrationist
ideal, the victory of the world of the pure, good, sinless, blessed is
projected into the future as conclusion, finale, great hope, as the
“coming of the kingdom of God.”
------ 1 hope that at this artificial inflation of a small species
into the absolute measure of things one is still permitted to laugh?
205 (Spring-Fall 1887)
I do not like at all about that Jesus of Nazareth or his apostle
Paul that they put so many ideas into the heads of little people, as
if their modest virtues were of any consequence. We have had to
pay too dearly for it: for they have brought the more valuable
qualities of virtue and man into ill repute; they have set the bad
conscience of the noble soul against its self-sufficiency; they have
led astray, to the point of self-destruction, the brave, magnanimous,
daring, excessive inclinations of the strong soul—

In the New Testament, and specifically in the Gospels, I hear
absolutely nothing “divine” speaking: much rather an indirect form

stinism; the entire treasury of proverbs is laid claim to and fully
utilized; was it necessary for a god to come in order to say to
these publicans etc*—

Primitive Christianity is abolition of the state: forbids oaths,
war service, courts of justice, self-defense and the defense of any
kind of community, the distinction between fellow countrymen and
foreigners, and also the differentiation of classes.
Christ’s example: he does not resist those who are harming
him; he does not defend himself; he does more: he “turns the other
cheek” (to the question: “Tell us whether thou be the Christ” he
answers: “Hereafter shall ye see the Son of Man sitting on the
right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven” ). He
forbids his disciples to defend him; he makes it clear that he could
get help but will not.
Christianity is also abolition of society: it prefers all that
society counts of little worth, it grows up among outcasts and the
condemned, among lepers of all kinds, “sinners,” “publicans,”
prostitutes, the most stupid folk (the “fishers” ); it disdains the
rich, the learned, the noble, the virtuous, the “correct”—
208 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
The war against the noble and powerful as it is waged in the

a decided refusal to recognize one’s own cunning.

The gospel: the news that a gateway to happiness stands open
for the poor and lowly—that all one has to do is free oneself from
the institutions, traditions, guardianship of the upper classes: to
this extent the rise of Christianity is nothing more than the typical
socialist doctrine.
Property, gain, fatherland, rank and status, tribunals, police,
state, church, education, art, the army: all are so many hindrances
to happiness, errors, snares, works of the devil, upon which the
gospel passes judgment— all typical of socialist doctrine.
In the background is insurrection, the explosion of a stored-up

antipathy towards the “masters,” the instinct for how much happi­
ness could lie, after such long oppression, simply in feeling oneself
free— (Usually a sign that the lower orders have been too well
treated, their tongues have already tasted a happiness forbidden
them— It is not hunger that provokes revolutions, but that the
people have acquired an appetite en mangeant37— ).
210 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Read the New Testament as a book of seduction: virtue is
appropriated in the instinct that with it one can capture public
opinion— and indeed the most modest virtue, which recognizes
the ideal sheep and nothing further (including the shepherd— ):
a little, sweet, well-meaning, helpful, and enthusiastically cheer­
ful kind of virtue that expects absolutely nothing from the outside
—that sets itself altogether apart from “the world.” The most ab­
surd arrogance, as if on one hand the community represented all
that is right, and on the other the world all that is false, eternally
reprehensible, and rejected, and as if the destiny of mankind re­
volved about this fact. The most absurd hatred toward everything
in power: but without touching it! A kind of inner detachment that
outwardly leaves everything as it was (servitude and slavery; to
know how to turn everything into a means of serving God and
virtue).
211 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
Christianity is possible as the most private form of existence;
it presupposes a narrow, remote, completely unpolitical society—
it belongs in the conventicle. A “Christian state,” “Christian poli­
tics,” on the other hand, are a piece of impudence, a lie, like for
instance a Christian leadership of an army, which finally treats the
“God of Hosts” as if he were chief of staff. The papacy, too, has
never been in a position to carry on Christian politics; and when
reformers indulge in politics, as JLuther did, one sees that they are
just as much followers of Machiavelli as any immoralist or tyrant.

of the impudent dogmas that have adorned themselves with its
name: it requires neither the doctrine of a personal God, nor that
of sin, nor that of immortality, nor that of redemption, nor that
of faith; it has absolutely no need of metaphysics, and even less
of asceticism, even less of a Christian “natural science.” Chris­
tianity is a way of life, not a system of beliefs. It tell us how to
act, not what we ought to believe.
Whoever says today: “I will not be a soldier,” “I care nothing
for the courts,” “I shall not claim the services of the police,” “I
will do nothing that may disturb the peace within me: and if I
must suffer on that account, nothing will serve better to maintain
my peace than suffering”— he would be a Christian.38

Toward a history of Christianity. Continual change of milieu:
Christian doctrine is therefore continually changing its emphasis—
Favoring of lowly and little people— The development of caritas30— The type “Christian” reassumes step by step everything
that it originally negated (in the negation of which it endured— ).
The Christian becomes citizen, soldier, judge, worker, merchant,
scholar, theologian, priest, philosopher, farmer, artist, patriot,
politician, “prince”—he takes up again all the activities he has
forsworn (—self-defense, judgment, punishment, oath-taking, dis­
tinguishing between nation and nation, contempt, wrath— ). The
whole life of the Christian is at last exactly the life from which
Christ preached deliverance—
The church is what is as much a symptom of the triumph of
the anti-Christian as the modern state, modern nationalism— The
church is the barbarization of Christianity.
214 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)

Christianity as a denaturalization of herd-animal morality:
accompanied by absolute misunderstanding and self-deception.
Democratization is a more natural form of it, one less mendacious.
Datum: the oppressed, the lowly, the great masses of slaves
and semi-slaves desire power.
First step: they make themselves free— they ransom them­
selves, in imagination at first, they recognize one another, they
prevail.
Second step: they enter into battle, they demand recognition,
equal rights, “justice.”
Third step: they demand privileges (— they draw the repre­
sentatives of power over to their side).
Fourth step: they demand exclusive power, and they get it—
In Christianity, three elements must be distinguished: (a) the
oppressed of all kinds, (b) the mediocre of all kinds, (c) the dis­
contented and sick of all kinds. With the first element Christianity
fights against the political nobility and its ideal; with the second
element, against the exceptional and privileged (spiritually, physic­
ally— ) of all kinds; with the third element, against the natural
instinct of the healthy and happy.
When a victory is won, the second element steps into the fore­
ground; for then Christianity has persuaded the healthy and happy
to its side (as warriors in its cause), likewise the powerful (as
interested parties on account of the conquest of the m ob)— and
now it is the herd instinct, the mediocre nature which is of value
from any point of view, which gets its supreme sanction through
Christianity. This mediocre nature at last grows so conscious of
itself (— acquires courage for itself— ) that it arrogates even politi­
cal power to itself—
Democracy is Christianity made natural: a kind of “return
to nature” after, on account of its extreme antinaturalness, it could
be overcome by the opposite values.— Consequence: the aristo­
cratic ideal henceforth loses its naturalness ( “the higher man,”
“noble,” “artist,” “passion,” “knowledge,” etc.; romanticism as cult
of the exception, the genius, etc.).

When the “masters” could also become Christians.— It lies
in the instinct of a community (family, race, herd, tribe) to feel
that the conditions and desires to which it owes its survival are
valuable in themselves, e.g., obedience, reciprocity, consideration,
moderation, sympathy— consequently to suppress everything that
contradicts or stands in the way of them.
Likewise, it lies in the instinct of the rulers (be they indi­
viduals or classes) to patronize and applaud the virtues that make
their subjects Useful and submissive (— conditions and affects which
may be as different as can be from their ow n).
The herd instinct and the instinct of the rulers agree in praising
a certain number of qualities and conditions— but for differing
reasons: the former from direct egoism, the latter from indirect
egoism.
Submission of the master races to Christianity is essentially
the consequence of the insight that Christianity is a herd religion,
that it teaches obedience: in short, that Christians are easier to
rule than non-Christians. With this hint, the pope recommends
Christian propaganda to the emperor of China even today.
It should be added that the seductive force of the Christian
ideal works most strongly perhaps upon such natures as love
danger, adventure and opposition— as love all that involves risking
themselves while at the same time engendering a non plus ultra
of the feeling of power. Consider Saint Teresa, surrounded by the
heroic instincts of her brothers:— Christianity here appears as a
form of orgy of the will, of strength of will, as a heroic quixotism—

When and where has any man of consequence resembled the
Christian ideal— at least in such eyes as a psychologist and student
of man must have?— check all of Plutarch's heroes.
218 (Nov, 1887-March 1888)
Our pre-eminence: we live in the age of comparison, we can
verify as has never been verified before: we are in every way the
self-consciousness of history. We enjoy differently, we suffer dif­
ferently: our instinctive activity is to compare an unheard-of
number of things. We understand everything, we experience every­
thing, we no longer have in us any hostile feelings. Although we
may harm ourselves by it, our importunate and almost amorous
inquisitiveness attacks, unabashed, the most dangerous things—
‘'Everything is good”— it requires an effort for us to deny
anything. We suffer if we should happen to be so unintelligent as
to take sides against anything— Fundamentally, it is we scholars
who today best fulfill the teaching of Christ—
219 (1885-1886)
Irony against those who believe Christianity has been over­
come by the modern natural sciences. Christian value judgments
have not by any means been overcome this way. “Christ on the
cross” is the most sublime symbol— even today.

Christianity. The latter has only now attained to approximately

We have recovered the Christian ideal: it remains to determine
its value:
God, the faith in God, matter to us any longer? ‘God’ today merely a faded

1. What values are negated by it? What does its connlerideal
comprise?— Pride, pathos of distance, great responsibility, exuber­
ance, splendid animality, the instincts that delight in war and con­
quest, the deification of passion, of revenge, of cunning, of anger,
of voluptuousness, of adventure, of knowledge— ; the noble ideal
is negated: the beauty, wisdom, power, splendor and dangerous­
ness of the type “man” : the man who fixes goals, the “man of the
future” (— here Christianity appears as a logical consequence of
Judaism— )♦
2. Can it be realized?— Yes, under the right climatic con­
ditions, as the Indian ideal was. Work is missing in both.— It
detaches the individual from people, state, cultural community,
jurisdiction; it rejects education, knowledge, cultivation of good
manners, gain, commerce— it lets everything go that comprises the
usefulness and value of man—it shuts him off by means of an
idiosyncrasy of feeling. Unpolitical, antinational, neither aggressive
nor defensive— possible only within the most firmly ordered
political and social life, which allows these holy parasites to pro­
liferate at public expense—
3. It is a consequence of the will to pleasure— and to nothing
else! “Blessedness” counts as something self-evident, which no
longer requires any justification—everything else (how to Jive and
let live) is only a means to an end—
But this way of thinking is base: fear of pain, of defilement,
of corruption as a sufficient motive for letting everything go—
This is a wretched way of thinking— Sign of an exhausted race—
One should not let oneself be deceived. (“Become as little chil­
dren”— . Of related nature: Francis of Assisi, neurotic, epileptic,
a visionary, like Jesus.)
222 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
The higher man is distinguished from the lower by his fear­
lessness and his readiness to challenge misfortune: it is a sign
of degeneration when eudaemonistic valuations begin to prevail
(— physiological fatigue, feebleness of will— ). Christianity, with
its perspective of “blessedness,” is a mode of thought typical of
a suffering and feeble species of man. Abundant strength wants
to create, suffer, go under: the Christian salvation-for-bigots is
bad music to it, and its hieratic posture an annoyance.

Poverty, humility, and chastity— dangerous and slanderous
ideals, but, like poisons in the case of certain illnesses, useful cures,
e.g., in the Roman imperial era.
All ideals are dangerous: because they debase and brand the
actual; all are poisons, but indispensable as temporary cures.
224 {Nov. 1887-March 1888)
God created man happy, idle, innocent, and immortal: our
actual life is a false, decayed, sinful existence, an existence of
punishment— Suffering, struggle, work, death are considered as
objections and question marks against life, as something that ought
not to last; for which one requires a cure— and has a cure!—
From the time of Adam until now, man has been in an
abnormal state: God himself has sacrificed his son for the guilt of
Adam, in order to put an end to this abnormal state: the natural
character of life is a curse; Christ gives back the state of normality
to him who believes in him: he makes him happy, idle and inno­
cent.— But the earth has not begun to be fruitful without work;
women do not bear children without pain; sickness has not ceased;
the most devout believers have just as hard a time of it here as the
least devout unbelievers. That man has been freed from death and
sin (assertions which permit of no verification)— has been asserted
by the church with all the more emphasis. “He is free from sin”—
not through his own deed, not through a stern struggle on his part,
but ransomed for freedom through the act of redemption— conse­
quently perfect, innocent, paradisiacal—
The true life is only a faith (i,e., a self-deception, a madness).
The whole of struggling, battling, actual existence, full of splendor
and darkness, only a bad, false existence: the task is to be redeemed
from it,
“Man innocent, idle, immortal, happy”— this conception of
“supreme desiderata” must be criticized above all. Why are guilt,
work, death, suffering (and, from a Christian viewpoint, knowl­
edge— ) contrary to the supreme desiderata?— The lazy Christian
concepts “blessedness,” “innocence,” “immortality”—

The eccentric concept of “holiness” is lacking—“God” and
“man” have not been tom asunder. “Miracles” are lacking—this
sphere simply isn’t there: the only sphere worth consideration is
the “spiritual” (i.e., the symbolic-psychological). As decadence:
pendant to “epicureanism”— Paradise, as conceived by the Greeks,
also only the “garden of Epicurus.”
Any task is lacking in such a life:— it desires nothing; a form
of the “Epicurean gods;” all reason is lacking to set up any further
goals, to have children:— everything has been attained.

They despised the body: they left it out of the account: more,
they treated it as an enemy. It was their delusion to believe that
one could carry a “beautiful soul” about in a cadaverous abor­
tion— To make this conceivable to others they needed to present
the concept “beautiful soul” in a different way, to revalue the
natural value, until at last a pale, sickly, idiotically fanatical crea­
ture was thought to be perfection, “angelic,” transfiguration, higher
man.
227 (Jan-Fall 1888)
Ignorance in psychologicis—the Christian has no nervous sys­
tem— ; contempt for, and a deliberate desire to disregard the
demands of the body, the discovery of the body; the presupposition
that this is in accordance with the higher nature of man, that it
must necessarily be good for the soul; the systematic reduction of
all bodily feelings to moral values; illness itself conceived as morally
conditioned, perhaps as punishment or as testing or also as a state
of salvation in which man becomes more perfect than he could be
if he were healthy (— Pascal’s idea); under certain circumstances,
making oneself sick deliberately.
228 (1883-1888)
What, then, is this struggle of the Christian “against nature”?
Do not let us be deceived by his words and explanations! It is

132

THE

W I L L TO P O W E R

nature against something that is also nature. With many it is fear,
with some disgust, with others a certain spirituality, with the best,
love of an ideal without flesh and desires, of an “abstraction from
nature”— these try to live up to their ideal. It goes without saying
that humility in place of self-reliance, anxious circumspection
toward the desires, liberation from normal duties (whereby a
higher feeling of rank is re-created), the incitement of a continual
war over tremendous things, habituation to effusions of feeling—
all this composes a type: in this type the excitability of a degenerate
body predominates, but this nervousness and the inspirations it
induces are interpreted otherwise. The taste of natures of this kind
tends (1) to subtlety, (2) to floweriness, (3 ) to extreme feelings.
Natural inclinations are satisfied, but under a new form of
interpretation, e.g., as “justification before God,” “the feeling of
redemption through grace” (— every undeniable pleasant feeling
is interpreted thus!— ), pride, voluptuousness, etc.
General problem: what will become of the man who defames'
the natural, and denies and degrades it in practice? In fact, the
Christian proves himself to be an exaggerated form of self-control:
in order to restrain his desires he seems to find it necessary to
extirpate or crucify them.
229 (March-June 1888)
Through the long succession of millennia, man has not known
himself physiologically: he does not know himself even today. To
know, e.g., that one has a nervous system (— but no “soul”— ) is
still the privilege of the best informed. But man is not content not
to know in this case. One must be very humane to say “I don’t
know that,” to afford ignorance.
If he is suffering or in a good mood, he has no doubt that he
can find the reason for it if only he looks. So he looks for the
reason— In truth, he cannot find the reason, because he does not
even suspect where he ought to look for it— What happens?— He
takes a consequence of his condition for its cause; e.g., a work
undertaken in a good mood (really undertaken because the good
mood had provided the courage for it) succeeds: ecco, the work
is the reason for the good mood.— In fact, the success was deter­
mined by the same thing that determined the good mood— by the
happy coordination of physiological forces and systems.

He feels ill: and consequently he has not got over some worry,
some scruple, some self-criticism.— In truth, the man believes his
ill condition is a consequence of his scruple, his “sin,” his “selfcriticism”—
But the condition of recovery returns, often after a profound
exhaustion and prostration. “How is it possible for me to feel so
free, so redeemed? It is a miracle; only a god can have performed
that.”— Conclusion: “He has forgiven me my sin”—
From this there follows a certain practice: to excite feelings
of sin, to prepare the way for contrition, one has to reduce the
body to a morbid and nervous condition. The method of doing
this is well known. As one might expect, there is no suspicion of
the causal logic of the case: there is a religious interpretation of
the mortification of the flesh, it seems an end in itself, whereas it
is only a means of making possible the morbid indigestion of
repentance (the "idee fixe” of sin, the hypnotizing of the hen by the
chalk line “sin” ).
The maltreatment of the body prepares the ground for the
sequence of “feelings of guilt,” i.e., a general state of suffering that
demands an explanation—
On the other hand, the method of “redemption” follows in the
same way: one provokes all kinds of orgies of feeling by prayers,
motions, gestures, oaths— exhaustion follows, often abruptly, often
in the form of epilepsy. And— after a condition of deep somnolence
comes the appearance of recovery— in religious language: “redemp­
tion.”4011
230 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
Formerly one considered these conditions and consequences of
physiological exhaustion more important than conditions of health
and their consequences, because they are rich in the sudden, the
fearful, the inexplicable and the incalculable. One was afraid: one
postulated here a higher world. Sleep and dream, shadows, the
night, natural terrors, have been held responsible for the creation
of two worlds: above all, the symptoms of physiological exhaustion
should have been considered in this regard. The ancient religions
actually disciplined the pious into a condition of exhaustion in

which they must experience such things— One believed one had

231 (March-]une 1888)
Sleep as consequence of every exhaustion, exhaustion as con­
sequence of every excessive excitement—
The necessity for sleep, the deification and adoration of the
very concept “sleep” in all pessimistic religions and philosophies—
The exhaustion is in this case a racial exhaustion: sleep,
regarded psychologically, is only a symbol of a much deeper and
longer compulsion to rest— In practice it is death that works so
seductively behind the image of its brother, sleep—
232 (March-June 1888)
The entire Christian training in repentance and redemption
can be conceived as a deliberately provoked folie circulaire:41 but,
as one might expect, producible only in predestined, that is, mor­
bidly inclined individuals.
233 (March-June 1888)
Against remorse and the purely psychological treatment of
it.— To be unable to have done with an experience is already a
sign of decadence. This reopening of old wounds, this wallowing
in self-contempt and contrition, is one more illness, out of which
no “salvation of the soul” can arise but only a new form of soul
sickness—
These “states of redemption” in the Christian are mere varia­
tions of one and the same diseased state— interpretations of the
epileptic crisis by a certain formula supplied, not by science, but
by religious delusion.
One is good in a sickly manner when one is sick— We now

Christianity operated as forms of hysteria and epilepsy.

on to a physiological basis: the “bite” of conscience as such is a
hindrance to recovery— one must try to counterbalance it all by
new activities, in order to escape from the sickness of self-torture
as quickly as possible— One should discredit the purely psycho­
logical practice of the church and the sects as harmful to health—
One cannot cure an invalid by prayers and the exorcizing of evil
spirits: the conditions of “repose” that supervene under the influ­
ence of such things are very far from inspiring confidence, in a
psychological sense—
One is healthy when one can laugh at the earnestness and
zeal with which one has been hypnotized by any single detail of
our life, when one feels that the “bite” of conscience is like a dog
biting on a stone— when one is ashamed of one’s remorse—
Previous practice, which was purely religious and psycho­
logical, aimed only at a change in the symptoms: it held a man to
be cured when he abased himself before the cross and swore to
be a good man— But a criminal who with a certain sombre serious­
ness cleaves to his fate and does not slander his deed after it is
done has more health of soul— The criminals among whom Dos­
toevsky lived in prison were one and all unbroken natures— are
they not worth a hundred times more than a “broken” Christian?
(— I recommend that the “bite” of conscience be treated
with Mitchell’s cure42------ )
234 (1883-1888)
The “bite” of conscience: sign that the character is not equal
to the deed. There is such a thing as a “bite” of conscience after
good works: the unfamiliar in them, that which raises them out of
the old milieu.— 43

43With sections 233-35 compare section 10 of the first chapter of
Twilight (Portable Nietzsche, p. 467): “Not to perpetrate cowardice against
one’s own acts! Not to leave them in the lurch afterward! The bite of
conscience is indecent.”
The influence of these passages and others on Sartre's The Flies is dis­
cussed in detail in my essay on "Nietzsche between Homer and Sartre:

phic, 67 (1964.1), especially pp. 65-73.

THE W ILL

235 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
Against remorse.— I do not like this kind of cowardice
toward one’s own deeds; one should not leave oneself in the lurch
at the onset of unanticipated shame and embarrassment. An
extreme44 pride, rather, is in order. After all, what is the good of
it! No deed can be undone by being regretted; no more than by
being “forgiven” or “atoned for.” One would have to be a theo­
logian to believe in a power that annuls guilt: we immoralists
prefer not to believe in “guilt.” We hold instead that every action
is of identical value at root—and that actions that turn against us
may, economically considered, be nonetheless useful, generally
desirable actions.
In any particular case we will allow that an act could easily
have been spared us—but circumstances favored it. Which of us,
if favored by circumstance, would not have gone through the entire
gamut of crime?
One should never say on that account: “You should not have
done this or that,” but always: “How strange that I should not
have done that a hundred times before!”
After all, very few actions are typical actions and real epit­
omes of a personality; and considering how little personality most
men have, a man is seldom characterized by a single action. Acts
of circumstance, merely epidermal, merely reflexes that respond to
a stimulus: long before the depths of our being are touched by it,
consulted about it. A rage, a reach, a knife thrust: what of per­
sonality is in that?45
A deed often brings with it a numbness and lack of freedom:
so that the doer is as if spellbound at its recollection and feels as
if he were an accessory of it. This spiritual disorder, a form of
hypnotism, must be resisted at all cost: a single deed, whatever it
may be, is, in comparison with everything one has done, a zero,
and may be deducted without falsifying the account. The iniquitous
interest that society may have in treating our entire existence from
a single point of view, as if its meaning lay in bringing forth one
single deed, should not infect the doer himself: unfortunately this

German editors. See also the preceding footnote.

happens almost all the time. That stems from the fact that a
spiritual disturbance follows every deed with unusual consequences,
whether these consequences are good or ill. Observe a lover who
has received a promise, or a poet applauded by an audience: so
far as torpor intellectualis is concerned, they differ in no way from
an anarchist confronted with a search warrant.
There are actions which are unworthy of us: actions that, if
regarded as typical, would reduce us to a lower class of man. Here
one has only to avoid the error of regarding them as typical. There
are other kinds of actions of which we are unworthy: exceptions
born of a particular abundance of happiness and health, our high­
est floodtide driven so high for once by a storm, an accident: such
actions and “works” are likewise not typical. One should never
measure an artist by the standard of his works.
236 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
a. In proportion as Christianity still;seems necessary today,
man is still savage and fateful—
b. From another point of view it is not necessary, but
extremely harmful, although enticing and seductive because it cor­
responds to the morbid character of whole classes, whole types of
contemporary humanity— decadents of all kinds, they follow their
inclinations when they aspire to Christianity—
One must distinguish clearly between a. and b. In case a.
Christianity is a cure, at least a means of taming (— under certain
circumstances it serves to make sick: which can be useful in break­
ing savagery and brutality). In case b. it is itself a symptom of
sickness, propagates decadence; here it works against a corroborat­
ing system of treatment, here it is the invalid’s instinct against that
which is good for him—

even the fulfilment of the demand must be represented in a

The struggle with the canaille and the cattle. If a certain tam­

possible—
This chasm increases in the higher castes their self-regard,
their faith in that which they represent—hence the chandala. Con­
tempt and an excess of it is perfectly correct psychologically; that
is to say, exaggerated a hundredfold, so that it may at least be
copied.40
238 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
The struggle against the brutal instincts is different from the
struggle against the sick instincts; to make sick may even be a
means of mastering brutality. Christian psychological practice often
leads to the conversion of a brute into a sick: and consequently tame
animal.
The struggle against brutal and savage natures must be a
struggle using means that affect them: superstitions are indispensa­
ble and essential—47

but without the absurd dogmas (the most repellent abortions of

that it is true, it is in the highest degree prudent to be a Christian.

Today one finds, as a sign of how much Christianity has declined
in fearfulness, that other attempt to justify it by saying that even
if it were an error, one might yet have during one’s life the great
advantage and enjoyment of this error:—■it therefore seems that
this faith ought to be maintained precisely for the sake of its
tranquilizing effect— not, therefore, from fear of a threatening
possibility, rather from fear of a life that has lost one charm. This
hedonistic turn, the proof from pleasure, is a symptom of decline:
it replaces the proof from strength, from that which overpowers us
in the Christian idea, from /ear. In fact* with this reinterpretation
Christianity is approaching exhaustion: one is content with an
opiate Christianity because one has the strength neither to seek,
to struggle, to dare, to wish to stand alone, nor for Pascalism, for
this brooding self-contempt, for faith in human unworthiness, for
the anguished feeling that one is “perhaps damned.” But a Chris­
tianity intended above all to soothe diseased nerves has really no
need of that fearful solution of a “God on the cross” : which is
why Buddhism is silently gaining ground everywhere in Europe.
241 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
The humor of European culture: One holds this to be true but
does that. E.g.* what is the point of the arts of reading and criti­
cism as long as the ecclesiastical interpretation of the Bible, Protes­
tant as well as Catholic, is cultivated as ever?
242 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
One does not consider closely enough how barbarous the
concepts are by which we Europeans still live. That men have been
capable of believing that “salvation of the soul” depended on a
book!— And they tell me this is still believed today.
What is the point of scientific education, criticism and herme­
neutics if such a lunatic exposition of the Bible as is still cultivated
by the church has not yet turned the blush of shame into a perma­
nent skin color?
243 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
To consider: to what extent the fateful belief in divine provi­
dence— the most paralyzing belief for hand and reason there has

140

T H E W I L L TO P O W E R

ever been— stitt exists; to what extent Christian presuppositions
and interpretations still live on under the formulas “nature,”
“progress,” “perfectibility,” “Darwinism,” under the superstitious
belief in a certain relationship between happiness and virtue,
unhappiness and guilt. That absurd trust in the course of things,
in “life,” in the “instinct of life,” that comfortable resignation that
comes from the faith that if everyone only does his duty all will be
well— this kind of thing is meaningful only by supposing a direc­
tion of things sub specie boni. Even fatalism, the form philosophi­
cal sensibility assumes with us today, is a consequence of this long
belief in divine dispensation, an unconscious consequence: as if
what happens were no responsbility of ours (—-as though it were

It is the height of psychological mendaciousness in man to
frame according to his own petty standard of what seems good,
wise, powerful, valuable, a being that is an origin and “in-itself”—
and therewith to abolish iii his mind the entire causal process
by means of which any kind of goodness, any kind of wisdom,
any kind of power exists and possesses valuer In short, to posit
elements of the most recent and contingent origin as not created
but “in-themselves” and perhaps even as the cause of creation in
general—
Judging from experience, from every instance in which a
man has raised himself significantly above the average of humanity,
we see that every high degree of power involves freedom from
good and evil and from “true” and “false,” and cannot take into
account the demands of goodness: we see that the same applies to
every high degree of wisdom—goodness is abrogated in it as
much as veracity, justice, virtue, and other popular fancies in
valuation. Finally, every high degree of goodness itself: is it not
patent that it presupposes a spiritual myopia and coarseness? in­
cluding the inability to distinguish at a distance between true and
false, between useful and harmful? not to discuss the fact that a
high degree of power in the hands of the highest degree of goodness
would lead to the most calamitous consequences (“the abolition
of evil”)?— In fact, one needs only to see what tendencies the

“God of love” inspires in his believers: they ruin mankind for the
sake of the “good.”— In practice, the actual constitution of the
world has shown this same God to be the God of the extremest
shortsightedness, devilry and impotence: which reveals how much
value there is in this conception of him.
Knowledge and wisdom in themselves have no value; no
more than goodness: one must first be in possession of the goal
from which these qualities derive their value or nonvalue— there
could be a goal in the light of which great knowledge might repre­
sent a great disvalue (if, for instance, a high degree of deception
were one of the prerequisites of the enhancement of life; likewise
if goodness were perhaps able; to paralyze and discourage the
springs of the great longing)—r
Taking our human life as it is, all “truth,” all “goodness,’’ all
“holiness;” all “divinity” in the Christian style has up to now
shown itself to be highly dangerous-r-even now mankind is in
danger of perishing through an idealism inimical of life.*8
245 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Consider the damage all human institutions sustain if a
divine and transcendent higher sphere is postulated that must first
sanction these institutions. By then growing accustomed to seeing
their value in this sanction (e.g., in the case of marriage), one has
reduced theif natural dignity, in certain circumstances denied it—
Nature has been ill-judged to the extent to which one has brought
into honor the antinaturalness of a God. “Natural” has come to
mean the same as “contemptible,” “bad’—
The fatefulness of a belief in God as the reality of the highest
moral qualities: all actual values were therewith denied and sys­
tematically conceived as non-values. Thus antinaturalness as­
sumed the throne. With relentless logic one arrived at the absolute
demand to deny nature.

In moving the doctrine of selflessness and love into the fore­
ground, Christianity was in no way establishing the interests of

the species as of higher value than the interests of the individual.
Its real historical effect, the fateful element in its effect, remains,
on the contrary, in precisely the enhancement of egoism, of the
egoism of the individual, to an extreme (-—to the extreme of in­
dividual immortality). Through Christianity, the individual was
made so important, so absolute, that he could no longer be sac­
rificed: but the species endures only through human sacrifice—
All “souls” became equal before God: but this is precisely the
most dangerous of all possible evaluations! If one regards indi­
viduals as equal, one calls the species into question* one encourages
a way of life that leads to the ruin of the species: Christianity is
the counterprinciple to the principle oi selection. If the degenerate
and sick (“the Christian”) is to be accorded the same value as the
healthy (“the pagan”), or even more value, as in Pascal’s judgment
concerning sickness and health, then unnaturalness becomes law—
This universal love of men is in practice the preference for
the suffering, underprivileged* degenerate: it has in fact lowered
and weakened the strength, the responsibility, the lofty duty to
sacrifice men. All that remains, according to the Christian scheme
of values, is to sacrifice oneself: but this residue of human sacrifice
that Christianity concedes and even advises has, from the stand­
point of general breeding, no meaning at all. H ie prosperity of the
species is unaffected by the self-sacrifice of: this or that individual
(— whether it be in the monkish and ascetic manner or, with
the aid of crosses, pyres, and scaffolds, as “martyrs” of erro r).
The species requires that the ill-constituted, weak, degenerate,
perish: but it was precisely to them that Christianity turned as a
conserving force; it further enhanced that instinct in the weak,
already so powerful, to take care of and preserve themselves and
to sustain one another. What is “virtue” and “charity” in Chris­
tianity if not just this mutual preservation* this solidarity of the
weak* this hampering of selection? What is Christian altruism if
not the mass-egoism of the weak, which divines that if all care for
one another each individual will be preserved as long as possible?—
If one does not feel such a disposition as an extreme im­
morality, as a crime against life, One belongs with the company
of the sick and possesses its instincts oneself—
Genuine charity demands sacrifice for the good of the species
— it is hard, it is full of self-overcoming, because it needs human
sacrifice. And this pseudo humaneness called Christianity wants
it established that no one should be sacrificed—

Nothing would be more useful or more to be encouraged
than a thoroughgoing practical nihilism. As I understand all the
phenomena of Christianity and pessimism, they say: “We are ripe
for nonexistence; for us it is reasonable not to exist.” This language
of “reason” is also, in this case, the language of selective nature.
What, on the other hand, is to be condemned in the sternest
terms is the ambiguous and cowardly compromise of a religion
such as Christianity: more precisely, such as the church: which,
instead of encouraging death and self-destruction, protects every­
thing ill-constituted and sick and makes it propagate itself—
Problem: with what means could one attain to a severe form
of really contagious nihilism: such as teaches and practices volun­
tary death with scientific conscientiousness (— and not a feeble,
vegetable existence in expectation of a false afterlife— )?
One cannot sufficiently condemn Christianity for having de­
valuated the value of such a great purifying nihilistic movement,
which was perhaps already being formed, through the idea of the
immortal private person: likewise through the hope of resurrec­
tion: in short, through continual deterrence from the deed of
nihilism, which is suicide—
It substituted slow suicide: gradually a petty, poor, but
durable life; gradually a quite ordinary, bourgeois, mediocre life,
etc.

Christian moral quackery.— Pity and contempt succeed one
another in quick alternation, and occasionally I get enraged, as
at the sight of some mean crime. Here error is made a duty— a
virtue; blundering is made into an art, the instinct for destruction
systematized as “redemption”; here every operation becomes an
injury, an amputation even of those organs whose energy is a
precondition of any return to health. And the most that is achieved
is never healing, but only the substitution of one set of evil symp­
toms for another—
And this dangerous nonsense, this systematized disfiguring
and castration of life, is counted holy, inviolable; to live in its
service, to be an instrument of this healing art, to be a priest,

T H E W I L L TO P O WE R

makes one distinguished, venerable, makes one holy and even
inviolable. Only divinity can be the author of this highest healing
art: only as revelation can redemption be understood, as an art
of grace, as the most undeserved gift granted to the creature.
First proposition: health of soul is regarded as sickness, as
suspicious—
Second proposition: the prerequisites of a strong and flourish­
ing life, strong desires and passions, count as objections to a
strong and flourishing life.
Third proposition: all that threatens man with danger, all
that might master and destroy him, is evil, is reprehensible— is to
be tom from his soul by its roots.
Fourth proposition: man made harmless to himself and others,

ness, the “sinner”— this is the most desirable type, and one that

What is it I protest against? That one should take this petty,
peaceable mediocrity, this equilibrium of a soul that knows noth­
ing of the mighty motivation of great accumulations of strength,
for something exalted, possibly even for the measure of man.
Bacon of Verulam says: Tnfimarum virtutum apud vulgus
laus est, mediarum admiratio, supremarum sensus nullus.*a Chris­
tianity, however, belongs, as a religion, to the vulgus: it has no
feeling for the highest species of virtus.

Let us see what “the true Christian” does with all that which
his instinct opposes:—he sullies and suspects the beautiful, the
splendid, the rich, the proud, the self-reliant, the knowledgeable,
the powerful— in summa, the whole of culture: his object is to
deprive it of a good conscience251 (Jan.-Fall 1888)

a modest way but in the wrong way. As long as one has not felt
Christian morality to be a capital crime against life its defenders
have had it all their own way. The question of the mere “truth”
of Christianity—whether in regard to the existence of its God or
the historicity of the legend of its origin, not to speak of Christian
astronomy and natural science— is a matter of secondary im­
portance as long as the question of the value of Christian morality
is not considered. Is Christian morality worth anything, or is it a
shame and digrace despite all the holiness of its arts of seduction?
The problem of truth can slip away into hiding places of all kinds;
and the greatest believers may finally avail themselves of the
logic of the greatest unbelievers to create for themselves a right to
affirm certain things as irrefutable— namely, as beyond the means
of all,refutation-—r(this artifice is today called “Kantian Criticism” ) .
252 (Novi 1887-March 1888)
One should never forgive Christianity for having destroyed
such men as Pascal. One should never cease from combating just
this in Christianity: its will to break precisely the strongest and
noblest souls. One should never rest as long as this one thing
has not been utterly and completely destroyed: the ideal of man
invented by Christianity, its demands upon men, its Yes and its
No with regard to men. The whole absurd residue of Christian
fable, conceptual cobweb-spinning and theology does not concern
us; it could be a thousand times more absurd and we would not
lift a finger against it. But we do combat the ideal that, with its
morbid beauty and feminine seductiveness, With its furtive Slander­
ous eloquence appeals to all the cowardices and vanities of
wearied souls— and the strongest have their weary hours—-as if
all that might, in such states, seem most useful and desirable—
trust, guilelessness, modesty, patience, love of one’s fellows, resig­
nation, submission to God, a sort of unharnessing and abdication
of one’s whole ego— were also the most useful and desirable as
such; as if the petty, modest abortion of a soul, the virtuous average-and-herd man, did not only take precedence over the stronger,
more evil, covetous, defiant, prodigal, and therefore a hundred
times more imperiled kind of man, but provided nothing less than
the ideal, the goal, the measure, the highest desideratum for man­
kind in general. To erect this ideal was the most sinister tempta­
tion ever placed before mankind: for with it, the more strongly

constituted exceptions and fortunate cases among men, in whom
the will to power and to the growth of the whole type “man”
took a step forward, were threatened with destruction; with the
values of this ideal, the growth of these higher men, who for the
sake of their superior claims and tasks also freely accept a life
more full of peril (expressed economically: a rise in the cost of
the undertaking in proportion to the decline in the probability of
its success) would be attacked at the roots. What is it we combat
in Christianity? That it wants to break the strong, that it wants to
discourage their courage, exploit their bad hours and their oc­
casional weariness, convert their proud assurance into unease and
distress of conscience* that it knows how to poison and sicken
the noble instincts until their strength, their will to power turns
backward, against itself— until the strong perish through orgies of
self-contempt and self-abuse: that gruesome way of perishing of
which Pascal provides the most famous example.

II. CRITIQUE OF M ORALITY
1. Origin of Moral Valuations
253 ( 1885-1886)
For the Preface of The Dawn00
An attempt to think about morality without falling under its
spell, mistrustful of the seductiveness of its beautiful gestures and
glances. A world we can revere, that is adequate to our drive to
worship—that continually proves itself—by providing guidance
in the particular and the general— : this is the Christian viewpoint
in which we have all grown up.
Through an increase in our acuteness, mistrust, scientificality
(also through a more ambitious instinct for veracity, thus under
anti-Christian influences), this interpretation has grown more and
more impermissible to us.
Subtlest way of escape: Kantian Criticism. The intellect dis­
putes its right to make interpretations of this sort as well as to
" T h e first edition o f The Dawn appeared in 1881; the second, w ith a
new preface, in 1887. This heading has always been om itted so far.

reject interpretations of this sort. One contents oneself with an
increase in one’s trust and faith, with a renunciation of all prova­
bility in matters of faith, with an inconceivable and superior “ideal”
(God) as a stopgap.
The Hegelian way out, following Plato, a piece of roman­
ticism arid reaction, at the same time a symptom of the historical
sense, of a new strength: the “spirit” itself is the “self-revealing
and self-realizing ideal” : more and more of this ideal iii which we
believe manifests itself in the course of its “process,” in “becom­
ing”— : thus the ideal realizes itself; faith is directed into the
future when, in accordance with its noble requirements, it can
worship. In short,
1. God is unknowable for us a:nd not demonstrable by us
(the hidden meaning of the epistemological movement);
2. God is demonstrable but as something in process of be­
coming, and we are part of it, as witness our impulse toward the
ideal (the hidden meaning of the historical movement).
Observe: criticism is never directed at the ideal itself, but
only at the problem, where the opposition to it originates: why
it has not yet been achieved or why it is not demonstrable in
small things and in great.
*

It makes all the difference whether one feels this state of
distress as a state of distress from passion, from a yearning, or
whether one barely reaches it as a problem after the utmost thought
arid with a certain force of historical imagination.
We discover the saiite phenomenon outside religion and
philosophy: utilitarianism (socialism, democracy) criticizes the
origin of moral evaluations, but it believes them just as much as
the Christian does. (Naivete: as if morality could survive when
the God who sanctions it is missing! The “beyond” absolutely
necessary if faith in morality is to be maintained.)
Basic problem: whence this omnipotence of faith? Of faith
in morality? (—Which betrays itself in this, too, that even the basic
conditions of life are falsely interpreted for the benefit of morality:
despite our knowledge of the animal world and the world of plants.
“Self-preservation” : the reconciliation of altruistic and egoistic
principles in the perspective of Darwinism.)

254 (1885-1886)
The inquiry into the origin of our evaluations and tables of
the good is in absolutely no way identical with a critique of them,
as is so often believed: even though the insight into some pudenda
origoB1 certainly brings with it a feeling of a diminution in value
of the thing that originated thus and prepares the way to a critical
mood and attitude toward it.
What are our evaluations and moral tables really worth?
What is the outcome of their rule? For whom? in relation to
what?— Answer: for life. But what is life? Here we need a new,
more definite formulation of the concept “life.” My formula for
it is: Life is will to power.
What is the meaning of the act of evaluation itself? Does it
point back or down to another, metaphysical world? (As Kant
still believed, who belongs before the great historical movement.)
In short: where did it originate? Or did it not “originate*’?—
Answer: moral evaluation is an exegesis, a way of interpreting.
The exegesis itself is a symptom of certain physiological condi­
tions, likewise of a particular spiritual level of prevalent judg­
ments: Who interprets?— Our affects.
255 ( 1883-1888)
All virtues physiological conditions: particularly the principal
organic functions considered as necessary, as good. All virtues
are really refined passions and enhanced states.
Pity and love of mankind as development of the sexual drive.
Justice as development of the drive to revenge. Virtue as pleasure
in resistance, will to power. Honor as recognition of the similar
and equal-in-power.
256 ( 1887-1888)
I understand by “morality” a system of evaluations that
partially coincides with the conditions of a creature’s life.
* Sham eful origin.

257 (March-June 1888)
Formerly one said of every morality: “By their fruits ye shall
know them.” I say of every morality: “It is a fruit by which I
recognize the soil from which it sprang.”
258 (1885-1886)
My attempt to understand moral judgments as symptoms and
sign languages which betray the processes of physiological pros­
perity or failure, likewise the consciousness of the conditions for
preservation and growth— a mode of interpretations of the same
worth as astrology, prejudices prompted by the instincts (of races,
communities, of the various stages of life, as youth or decay, etc.).
Applied to the specific Christian-European morality: Our
moral judgments are signs of decline, of disbelief in life, a prepara­
tion for pessimism.
M y chief proposition: there are no moral phenomena, there
is only a m oral interpretation of these phenomena. This interpre­
tation itself is of extra-moral origin.62
What does it mean that our interpretation has projected a
contradiction into existence?— Of decisive importance: behind
all other otlier evaluations these moral evaluations stand in com­
mand. Supposing they were abolished, according to what would
we measure then? And then of what value would be knowledge,
etc., etc. ? ? ?
259 (1884)
Insight: all evaluation is made from a definite perspective:
that of the preservation of the individual, a community, a race, a
state, a church, a faith, a culture.— Because we forget that valua­
tion is always from a perspective, a single individual contains
within him a vast confusion of contradictory valuations and con­
sequently of contradictory drives. This is the expression of the
diseased condition in man, in contrast to the animals in which all
existing instincts answer to quite definite tasks.
This contradictory creature has in his nature, however, a
great method of acquiring knowledge: he feels many pros and

cons, he raises himself to justice— to comprehension beyond es­
teeming things good and evil.
The wisest man would be the one richest in contradictions,
who has, as it were, antennae for all types of men— as well as his
great moments of grand harmony— a rare accident even in us!
A sort of planetary motion—
260 ( 1883-1888)
“Willing” : means willing an end. “An end” includes an
evaluation. Whence come evaluations? Is their basis a firm norm,
“pleasant” and “painful”?
But in countless cases we first make a thing painful by invest­
ing it with an evaluation.
The extent of moral evaluations: they play a part in almost
every sense impression. Our world is colored by them.
We have invested things with ends and Values: therefore we
have in us an enormous fund of latent force: but by comparing
values it appears that contradictory things have been accounted
valuable, that many tables of value have existed (thus nothing is
valuable “in itself”).
Analysis of individual tables of Value revealed that their
erection was the eredtibn of the conditions— often erroneous—of
existence of a limited group—for its preservation.
Observation of contemporary mail re Veals that we employ
very diverse value judgments and that they no longer have any
creative force— the basis, “the condition of existence,” is how
missing from moral judgment. It is much more superfluous, it
is not nearly so painful.— It becomes arbitrary. Chaos.
Who creates the goal that stands above mankind and above
the individual? Formerly One employed morality for preservation:
but nobody wants to preserve any longer, there is nothing to pre­
serve. Therefore an experimental morality: to give oneself a goal.
261 ( 1883-1888)
What is the criterion of a moral action? (1) its disinterested­
ness, (2) its universal validity, etc. But this is armchair moralizing.
One must study peoples to see what the criterion is in every case,
and what is expressed by it: a belief that "such a scheme of

book t w o :

behavior is one of the first conditions of our existence.” Immoral
means “bringing destruction.” Now, all the communities in which
these propositions are discovered have perished: certain of these
propositions have been reaffirmed again and again because every
new community that arose had need of them again; e.g., “Thou
shalt not steal.” In ages when it was impossible to demand any
feeling for the community (e.g., in the imperium Romanum) , the
drive was directed to “salvation of soul j” in religious language:
or “the greatest happiness,” in philosophical terms. For even the
Greek moral philosophers no longer had any feeling for their
polls. 63
262 (1888)
The necessity of false values.— One can refute a judgment
by proving its conditionality: the need to retain it is not thereby
removed. False values cannot be eradicated by reasons any more
than astigmatism in the eyes of an invalid. One must grasp the
need for their existence: they are a consequence of causes which
have nothing to do with reasons,
263 (1885)
To see and to demonstrate the problem of morality—that
seems to me the new principal task, I deny that it has been done
in previous moral philosophy.
264 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
How false, how mendacious mankind has always been about
the basic facts of its inner world! To close one’s eyes to this, to
speak and not to speak about that—

lutions that have already occurred in moral judgments, and of how
fundamentally “evil” has several times been renamed “good.”

life-destroying effects of profound misery and atrophy:
“the suffering.”
4. Morality as the principle that opposes the fearful out­
bursts of the powerful: “the low ly”
267 (1885-1886)
It is a good thing to take “right,” “wrong,” etc., in a definite,
narrow, bourgeois sense, as in “Do right and fear no man” : i.e., to
do one’s duty according to a definite rude scheme within which a
community exists.
— Let us not think meanly of that which two thousand years
of morality have bred in our spirit!
268 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
Two types of morality must not be confused: the morality
with which the healthy instinct defends itself against incipient de­
cadence— and another morality with which this very decadence
defines and justifies itself and leads downwards.
The former is usually stoical, hard, tyrannical (— Stoicism
itself was such a brake-shoe morality); the latter is enthusiastic,
sentimental, full of secrets; it has the women and “beautiful feel­
ings” on its side (— primitive Christianity was such a morality).
269 ( 1883-1888)
To get the whole of moralizing into focus as a phenomenon.
Also as a riddle. The phenomena of morality have occupied me
like riddles. Today I would know how to answer the question:
What does it mean that the welfare of my neighbor ought to
possess for me a higher value than my own? but that my neighbor
himself ought to assess the value of his welfare differently than I,
that is, that he should subordinate it to my welfare? What is the
meaning of that “Thou shalt,” which even philosophers regard as
“given”?
The apparently crazy idea that a man should esteem the
actions he performs for another more highly than those he per­
forms for himself, and that this other should likewise, etc. (that
one should call good only those actions that a man performs with
an eye, not to himself, but to the welfare of another) has a mean­

ing: namely, as the social instinct resting on the valuation that the
single individual is of little account, but all individuals together are
of very great account provided they constitute a community with
a common feeling and a common conscience. Therefore a kind of
training in looking in a certain definite direction, the will to a
perspective that seeks to make it impossible to see oneself.
My idea: goals are lacking and these must be individualsV
We observe how things are everywhere: every individual is sacri­
ficed and serves as a tool. Go into the street and you encounter
lots of “‘slaves.” Whither? For what?
270 (Spring-Fall 1887)
How is it possible that a man has respect for himself with
regard to moral values alone, that he considers everything else
subordinate and of little worth compared with good, evil, improve­
ment, salvation of soul, etc.? e.g., Henri Fred. Amiel.56 What is
the meaning of the moral idiosyncrasy?— I mean in a psychological
sense, also in a physiological sense; e.g., Pascal. That is, in cases
where other great qualities were not lacking; also in the case of
Schopenhauer, who obviously valued that which he did not and
could not have— is it not the consequence of a merely habitual
moral interpretation of actual states of pain and displeasure? is
it not a definite kind of sensibility that does not understand the
cause of its frequent feelings of displeasure but believes it explains
them with moral hypotheses? So that even a transitory feeling of
health and strength immediately appears, in the perspective of a
“good conscience,” to be illumined by the nearness of God, by
the consciousness of redemption?—
Thus the man of moral idiosyncrasy has (1) either really
acquired his worth through approximating society’s model of virtue:
“the good man,” “the righteous”— a highly respectable condition of
mediocrity: mediocre in all his abilities but decent, conscientious,
solid, respected, trusty; (2) or he believes he has acquired it
because he does not know how otherwise to understand all his
states—he is unknown to himself, so he interpretes himself in
this way.—
Morality as the only scheme of interpretation by which man
can endure himself— a kind of pride?—

The predominance of moral values.— Consequences of this
predominance: the corruption of psychology, etc.; the universal
fatality which follows from it. What does this predominance mean?
What does it point to?—
To a certain greater urgency for a definite Yes and No in this
field. All kinds of imperatives have been employed to make moral
values appear permanent: they have been commanded for the
longest time:— they seem instinctive, like inner commands. Moral
values reveal themselves to be conditions of the existence of society,
in that they are felt to be beyond discussion. The practice, which
is to say the utility, of agreement about the highest values has
here acquired a kind of sanction. We observe that every means is
employed to paralyze reflection and criticism in this field:— look
at the attitude of Kant! not to speak of those who reject as im­
moral all “inquiry” here—
272 (Spring-Fall 1887)
M y purpose: to demonstrate the absolute homogeneity of all
events and the application of moral distinctions as conditioned by
perspective; to demonstrate how everything praised as moral is
identical in essence with everything immoral and was made possible,
as in every development of morality, with immoral means and
for immoral ends— ; how, on the other hand, everything decried
as immoral is, economically considered, higher and more essential,
and how a development toward a greater fullness of life necessarily
also demands the advance of immorality. “Truth” the extent to
which we permit ourselves to understand this fact.
273 (1883-1888)
But don’t worry: for one needs a great deal of morality to be
immoral in this subtle way; I will speak in a parable:
A physiologist interested in a disease and an invalid who
claims to be cured of it do not have identical interests. Let us
suppose the disease is morality—for it is a disease— and that we
Europeans are the invalids: what subtle torment and difficulties
would arise if we Europeans were at the same time inquisitive

spectators and physiologists! Would we then really desire to be free
of morality? Would we want to be? Quite apart from the question
whether we could be. Whether we could be “cured.”—

2. The Herd
274 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Whose will to power is morality?— The common factor in
the history of Europe since Socrates is the attempt to make moral
values dominate over al! other values: so that they should be the
guide and judge not only of life but also of (1) knowledge, (2 )
the arts, (3) political and social endeavors. "Improvement” the
sole duty, everything else a means to it (or a disturbance, hin­
drance, danger: consequently to be combat ted to the point of anni­
hilation— ). A similar movement in China. A similar movement
in India.
What is the meaning of this will to power on the part of moral
values which has developed so tremendously on earth?
Answer:— three powers are hidden behind it: (1) the in­
stinct of the herd against the strong and independent; (2) the
instinct of the suffering and underprivileged against the fortunate;
(3) the instinct of the mediocre against the exceptional.— Enor­
mous advantage possessed by this movement, however much cruelty,
falseness, and narrow-mindedness have assisted it (for the history
of the struggle of morality with the basic instincts of life is itself
the greatest piece of immorality that has yet existed on earth— ).
275 (1883-1888)
Very few manage to see a problem in that which makes
our daily life, that to which we have long since grown accustomed—
our eyes are not adjusted to it: this seems to me to be the case
especially in regard to our morality.
The problem “every man as an object for others” is the
occasion of the highest honors: for himself—no!
The problem “thou shalt” : an inclination that cannot ex­
plain itself, similar to the sexual drive, shall not fall under the
general condemnation of the drives; on the contrary, it shall be
their evaluation and judge!

The problem of “equality,” while we all thirst after disstinction: here, on the contrary, we are supposed to make exactly
the same demands on ourselves as we make on others. This is
so insipid, so obviously crazy: but— it is felt to be holy, of a
higher rank, the conflict with reason is hardly noticed.
Sacrifice and selflessness as distinguishing, unconditional obe­
dience to morality, and the faith that one is everyone's equal before
it.
The neglect and surrender of well-being and life as distin­
guishing, the complete renunciation of making one’s own evalua­
tions, and the firm desire to see everyone else renounce them too.
“The value of an action is determined: everyone is subject to this
valuation.”
We see: an authority speaks—who speaks?— One may
forgive human pride if it sought to make this authority as high
as possible in order to feel as little humiliated as possible under
it. Therefore— God speaks!
One needed God as an unconditional sanction, with no court
of appeal, as a “categorical imperator”— : or, if one believed in
the authority of reason, one needed a metaphysic of unity, by
virtue of which this was logical
Now suppose that belief in God has vanished: the question
presents itself anew: “who speaks?”— My answer, taken not from
metaphysics but from animal physiology: the herd instinct speaks.
It wants to be master: hence its “thou shalt!”— it will allow
value to the individual only from the point of view of the whole,
for the sake of the whole, it hates those who detach themselves—
it turns the hatred of all individuals against them.
276 ( 1886-1887)
The whole of European morality is based upon what is use­
ful to the herd: the affliction of all higher, rarer men lies in this,
that everything that distinguishes them enters their consciousness
accompanied by a feeling of diminution and discredit. The strong
points of contemporary men are the causes of their pessimistic
gloom: the mediocre are, like the herd, little troubled with
questions and conscience— cheerful. (On the gloominess of the
strong: Pascal, Schopenhauer.)
The more dangerous a quality seems to the herd, the more
thoroughly is it proscribed.

THE W ILL

TO P O W E R

277 (1883-1888)
Morality of truthfulness in the herd. “You shall be knowable,
express your inner nature by clear and constant signs— otherwise
you are dangerous; and if you are evil, your ability to dissimulate
is the worst thing for the herd. We despise the secret and un­
recognizable.— Consequently you must consider yourself knowable, you may not be concealed from yourself, you may not believe
that you change.” Thus: the demand for truthfulness presupposes
the knowability and stability of the person. In fact, it is the object
of education to create in the herd member a definite faith concern­
ing the nature of man: it first invents this faith and then demands
“truthfulness.”
278 (1885)
Within a herd, within any community, that is to say inter
pares*1 the overestimation of truthfulness makes good sense. Not
to be deceived— and consequently, as a personal point of morality,
not to deceive! a mutual obligation between equals! In dealing
with what lies outside, danger and caution demand that one
should be on one’s guard against deception: as a psychological
preconditioning for this, also in dealing with what lies within.
Mistrust as the source of truthfulness.
279 (1883-1888)
Toward a critique of the herd virtues.— Inertia operates (1)
in trustfulness, since mistrust makes tension, observation, reflection
necessary;— (2) in veneration, where the difference in power
is great and submission necessary: so as not to fear, an attempt is
made to love, esteem, and to interpret the disparity in power as
disparity in value: so that the relationship no longer makes one
rebellious;— (3) in the sense of truth. What is true? Where an
explanation is given which causes us the minimum of spiritual
effort (moreover, lying is very exhausting);— (4) in sympathy.
It is a relief to count oneself the same as others, to try to feel as
they do, to adopt a current feeling: it is something passive com­
pared with the activity that maintains and constantly practices
wAmong equals.

the individual’s right to value judgments (the latter allows of no
rest)-,— (5) in impartiality and coolness of judgment: one shuns
the exertion of affects and prefers to stay detached, “objective” ;—
(6 ) in integrity: one would rather obey an existing law than create
a law oneself, than command oneself and others: the fear of
commanding— : better to submit than to react;— (7) in toleration:
the fear of exercising rights, of judging.
280 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The instinct of the herd considers the middle and the mean as
the highest and most valuable: the place where the majority finds
itself; the mode and manner in which it finds itself. It is therefore
an opponent of all orders of rank, it sees an ascent from beneath
to above as a descent from the majority to the minority. The herd
feels the exception, whether it be below or above it, as something
opposed and harmful to it. Its artifice with reference to the ex­
ceptions above it, the stronger, more powerful, wiser, and more
fruitful, is to persuade them to assume the role of guardians,
herdsmen, watchmen— to become its first servants:*8 it has there­
with transformed a danger into something useful. Fear ceases in
the middle: here one is never alone; here there is little room for
misunderstanding; here there is equality; here one’s own form of
being is not felt as a reproach but as the right form of being; here
contentment rules. Mistrust is felt toward the exceptions; to be an
exception is experienced as guilt.
281 (March-June 1888)
When, following the instinct of the community, we make
prescriptions and forbid ourselves certain actions, we quite reason­
ably do not forbid a mode of “being,” a “disposition,” but only a
certain direction and application of this “being,” this “disposition.”
But then the ideologist of virtue, the moralist, comes along and
says: “God sees into the heart! What does it matter if you refrain
from certain actions: you are no better for that!” Answer: My
dear Sir Long-Ears-and-Virtuous, we have no desire whatever to
be better, we are very contented with ourselves, all we desire is
not to harm one another— and therefore we forbid certain actions

when they are directed in a certain way, namely against us, while
we cannot sufficiently honor these same actions provided they
are directed against enemies of the community—against you, for
instance. We educate our children in them; we cultivate them—
If we shared that “God-pleasing” radicalism that your holy madness
recommends, if we were fools enough to condemn together with
those actions the source of them, the “heart,” the “disposition,”
that would mean condemning our own existence and with it its
supreme prerequisite— a disposition, a heart, a passion we honor
with the highest honors. By our decrees, we prevent this dispo­
sition from breaking out and expressing itself in an inexpedient way
—we are prudent when we make such law for ourselves, we are
also moral— Have you no suspicion, however faint, what sacrifice
it is costing us, how much taming, self-overcoming, severity
toward ourselves it requires? We are vehement in our desires,
there are times when we would like to devour each other— But
the “sense of community” masters us: please note that this is
almost a definition of morality.
282 (Fall 1888)
The weakness of the herd animal produces a morality very
similar to that produced by the weakness of the decadent: they
understand one another, they form an alliance (— the great
decadence religions always count on the support of the herd). In
itself, there is nothing sick about the herd animal, it is even in­
valuable; but, incapable of leading itself, it needs a “shepherd”—
the priests understand that— The state is not intimate, not clan­
destine enough; “directing the conscience” eludes it. And that is
how the herd animal has been made sick by the priest?—
283 (1883-1888)
Hatred for the privileged in body and soul: revolt of the
ugly, ill-constituted souls against the beautiful, proud, joyous. Their
means: inculpation of beauty, pride, joy: “there is no merit," “the
danger is tremendous: one should tremble and feel ill,” “natural­
ness is evil; it is right to oppose nature.” Also “reason.” (The anti­
natural as the higher).
Again it is the priests who exploit this condition and win the
“people” over. “The sinner” in whom God has more joy than in

the “just man.” This is the struggle against “paganism” (the pang
of conscience as the means of destroying harmony of soul).
The hatred of the average for the exceptional, of the herd
for the independent. (Custom as true “morality.”30) Turning
against “egoism” : only the “for another” has value. “We are
all equal”;— against lust for dominion, against “dominion” in
general;— against privilege;— against sectarians, free spirits,
skeptics;— against philosophy (as opposing the tool-and-corner
instinct); with philosophers themselves “the categorical impera­
tive,” the essence of morality “universal and general.”
284 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The conditions and desires that are praised:— peaceable,
fair, moderate, modest, reverent, considerate, brave, chaste, honest,
faithful, devout, straight, trusting, devoted, sympathetic, helpful,
conscientious, simple, mild, just, generous, indulgent, obedient,
disinterested, unenvious, gracious, industrious—
To distinguish: to what extent such qualities are conditioned
as means to a definite aim and end (often an “evil” end); or as
natural consequences of a dominating affect (e.g., spirituality) or
expression of a state of distress, which is to say: as condition of
existence (e.g., citizen, slave, woman, etc.).
Summa: they are none of them felt to be “good” for their
own sake, but from the first according to the standards of “society,”
“the herd,” as means to the ends of society and the herd, as neces­
sary to their preservation and advancement, at the same time as the
consequence of an actual herd instinct in the individual: thus
in the service of an instinct which is fundamentally different from
these conditions of virtue. For the herd is, in relation to the out­
side world, hostile, selfish, unmerciful, full of lust for dominion,
mistrust, etc.
In the “shepherd” this antagonism becomes patent: he must
possess opposite qualities to the herd.
Mortal enmity of the herd toward orders of rank: its instinct
favors the leveller (Christ). Toward strong individuals {les souverains) it is hostile, unfair, immoderate, immodest, impudent, in­
considerate, cowardly, mendacious, false, unmerciful, underhand,
envious, revengeful.

I teach: the herd seeks to preserve one type and defends itself
on both sides, against those who have degenerated from it (crim­
inals, etc.) and those who tower above it. The tendency of the herd
is directed toward standstill and preservation, there is nothing
creative in it.
The pleasant feelings with which the good, benevolent, just
man inspires us (in contrast to the tension, fear which the great,
new man arouses) are our own feelings of personal security and
equality: the herd animal thus glorifies the herd nature and then it
feels comfortable. This judgment of comfort masks itself with fair
words— thus “morality” arises.— But observe the hatred of the
herd for the truthful.—
286 (1883-1888)
Let one not be deceived about oneself! If one hears within
oneself the moral imperative as it is understood by altruism, one
belongs to the herd. If one has the opposite feeling, if one feels
one’s danger and abberration lies in disinterested and selfless
actions, one does not belong to the herd.
287 (1883-1888)
My philosophy aims at an ordering of rank: not at an in­
dividualistic morality.60 The ideas of the herd should rule in the
herd—but not reach out beyond it: the leaders of the herd require
a fundamentally different valuation for their own actions, as do the
independent, or the “beasts of prey,” etc.

3. General Remarks on Morality
288 (March-June 1888)
Morality as an attempt to establish human pride.— The theory
of “free will” is antireligious. It seeks to create the right for man to
think of himself as cause of his exalted state and actions: it is a
form of the growing feeling of pride.
w Cf. section 361.

Critique of Highest Values

Man feels his power, his “happiness,” as they say: there must
be “will” behind this state— otherwise it would not be his. Virtue
is the attempt to set the fact of willing and having-willed before
every exalted and strong feeling of happiness as a necessary ante­
cedent:— if the will to certain actions is regularly present in the
consciousness, a feeling of power may be interpreted as its effect.—
This is merely a perspective of psychology: always based on the
false presupposition that nothing belongs to us that we have not
consciously willed. The entire theory of responsibility depends
upon the naive psychology that the only cause is will and that
one must be aware of having willed in order to believe in oneself
as cause.
— Comes the countermovement: that of the moral philos­
ophers, still subject to the same prejudice that one is responsible
only for what one has willed. The value of man is posited as a
moral value: consequently his morality must be a causa p rim a l1
consequently there must be a principle in man, a “free will” as
causa prima.— The idea behind it is: if man is not causa prima as
will, then he is irresponsible— consequently he has no business
before the moral tribunal— virtue and vice would be automatic
and mechanical—
In summa: so that man may respect himself he must be capable
of doing evil.
289 (March-June 1888)
Play-acting as a consequence of the morality of “free will.”—
It is a step in the development of the feeling of power itself to have
caused one’s own exalted states (one’s perfection)— consequently,
one immediately concludes, to have willed them—
(Critique: All perfect acts are unconscious and no longer
subject to will; consciousness is the expression of an imperfect and
often morbid state in a person. Personal perfection as conditioned
by will, as consciousness, as reasoning with dialectics, is a carica­
ture, a kind of self-contradiction— A degree of consciousness
makes perfection impossible— Form of play-acting.)
290 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The moral hypothesis with the object of justifying God was:

164

evil must be voluntary (merely so that the voluntariness of good­
ness can be believed in), and on the other hand: the object of
evil and suffering is salvation.
The concept “guilt” as not extending back to the ultimate
ground of existence, and the concept “punishment” as an educative
benefit, consequently as the act of a good God.
Absolute dominion of moral valuation over all others: one
did not doubt that God could not be evil and could not do any­
thing harmful, i.e., by “perfection” one meant merely a moral
perfection.
291 (March-Iune 1888)
How false is the idea that the value of an action must depend
upon that which preceded it in consciousness!— And morality has
been judged according to this, even criminality—
The value of an action must be judged by its consequences—
say the Utilitarians— : to judge it by its origins implies an impossi­
bility, namely that of knowing its origins.
But does one know its consequences? For five steps ahead,
perhaps. Who can say what an action will stimulate, excite, pro­
voke? As a stimulus? Perhaps as a spark to touch off an explo­
sion?— The Utilitarians are naive— And in any case we must
first know what is useful: here too they look only five steps
ahead— They have no conception of the grand economy, which
cannot do without evil.
One does not know the origin, one does not know the conse­
quences:— does an action then possess any value at all?
The action itself remains: its epiphenomena in consciousness,
the Yes and the No that follow its performance: does the value
of an action lie in its subjective epiphenomena? (— that would
be like assessing the value of the music according to the pleasure
or displeasure it gives us— it gives its composer— ). Obviously
value feelings accompany it, a feeling of power, compulsion, impo­
tence; e.g., freedom, ease— put in another way: could one reduce
the value of an action to physiological values: whether it is the
expression of a complete or an inhibited life?02— It may be that

its biological value is expressed in this—
If therefore an action can be evaluated neither by its origin,
nor by its consequences, nor by its epiphenomena, then its value
is
unknown—
292 (Spring-Fall 1887)
On the denaturalization of morality. To separate the action
from the man; to direct hatred or contempt against the “sin”; to
believe there are actions that are good or bad in themselves.03
Restoration of “nature” : an action in itself is perfectly devoid
of value: it all depends on who performs it. One and the same
“crime” can be in one case the greatest privilege, in another a
stigma. In fact, it is the selfishness of the judges which interprets
an action, or its performer, in relation to its utility or harmfulness
to themselves (— or in relation to its similarity or unlikeness to
them ).
293 (March-June 1888)
The concept “reprehensible action” presents us with difficul­
ties. Nothing that happened at all can be reprehensible in itself:
for one should not want to eliminate it: for everything is so bound
up with everything else, that to want to exclude something means
to exclude everything. A reprehensible action means: a repre­
hended world—
And then further: in a reprehended world reprehending would
also be reprehensible— And the consequence of a way of thinking
that reprehended everything would be a way of living that affirmed
everything— If becoming is a great ring, then everything is equally
valuable, eternal, necessary.— In all correlations of Yes and No,
of preference and rejection, love and hate, all that is expressed is
a perspective, an interest of certain types of life: in itself, every­
thing that is says Yes.

merly one concluded: the conscience reprehends this action;
consequently this action is reprehensible. In fact, the. conscience
reprehends an action because it has been reprehended for a long
time. It merely repeats: it creates no values. That which in the past
decided to reprehend certain actions was not conscience: but the
insight into (or the prejudice against) their consequences—
The assent of the conscience, the pleasant feeling of “at
peace with oneself,” is of the same order as the pleasure of an
artist in his work—it proves nothing at all—
Self-contentment is as little a standard for that to which it
relates as its absence is an argument against the value of a thing.
We do not know nearly enough to be able to measure the value
of our actions: in addition, it is impossible for us to be objective
about them: even when we reprehend an action, we are not judges
but interested parties—
If noble agitation accompanies an action, this proves noth­
ing about its value: an artist can go through the highest possible
pathos of passion and bring forth something wretched. One should
say rather that these agitations are a means of seduction: they
lure our eyes, our strength away from criticism, from caution, from
suspicion, so that we perpetrate a stupidity— they make us stupid—
295 (1885-1886)
We are the heirs of the conscience-vivisection and self-cruci­
fixion of two millennia: in these we have had longest practice, in
these lies our mastery perhaps, certainly our subtlety; we have
conjoined the natural inclinations and a bad conscience.
A reverse attempt would be possible: to conjoin the unnatural
inclinations, I mean the inclination for the beyond, for things con­
trary to sense, reason, nature, in short all previous ideals, which
were all world-slandering ideals, with a bad conscience.
296 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The great crimes in psychology:
1. that all displeasure, all misfortune has been falsified with
the idea of wrong (guilt). (Pain has been robbed of innocence);
2. that all strong feelings of pleasure (wild spirits, voluptu­
ousness, triumph, pride, audacity, knowledge, self-assurance and

book t w o :

167

happiness as such) have been branded as sinful, as a seduction,
as suspicious;
3. that feelings of weakness, inward acts of cowardice, lack
of courage for oneself have been overlaid with sanctifying names
and taught as being desirable in the highest degree;
4. that everything great in man has been reinterpreted as
selflessness, as self-sacrifice for the sake of something else, some­
one else, that even in the man of knowledge, even in the artist,
depersonalization has been presented as the cause of the greatest
knowledge and ability;
5. that love has been falsified as surrender (and altruism),
while it is an appropriation or a bestowal following from a super­
abundance of personality. Only the most complete persons can
love; the depersonalized, the “objective,” are the worst lovers
(— one has only to ask the girls!) This applies also to love of
God or of “fatherland”; one must be firmly rooted in oneself,
(Egoism as egomorphism, altruism as alter-ation.64
6. Life as punishment (happiness as temptation); the pas­
sions as devilish, confidence in oneself as godless.
This whole psychology is a psychology of prevention, a kind
of immuring out of fear; on one hand the great masses (the under­
privileged and mediocre) seek to defend themselves by means of
it against the stronger (— and to destroy them in their develop­
ment— ), on the other all the drives through which they best
prosper, sanctified and alone held in honor. Compare the Jewish
priesthood.
297 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The vestiges of debasement of nature through moral tran­
scendence: value of selflessness, cult of altruism; belief in repay­
ment within the play of consequences; belief in “goodness,” in
“genius” even, as if the one and the other were consequences of
selflessness; the continuance of the ecclesiastical sanction of bour­
geois life; absolute desire to misunderstand history (as an educative
work toward moralization) or pessimism in the face of history
(— the latter as much a consequence of the debasement of nature
as that pseudo justification, as that not desiring to see that which
the pessimist sees— ).

“Morality for morality’s sake”— an important step in its
denaturalization: it itself appears as the ultimate value. In this
phase it has permeated religion: e.g., in Judaism. And there is
likewise a phase in which it separates itself again from religion
and in which no God is “moral” enough for it: it then prefers
the impersonal ideal— This is the case at present,
“Art for art’s sake”— this is an equally dangerous principle:
therewith one introduces a false antithesis into things— it culmi­
nates in a defamation of reality (“idealization” into the ugly). If
one severs an ideal from reality one debases the real, one impov­
erishes it, one defames it. “The beautiful for the sake of the
beautiful,” “the true for the sake of the true,” “the good for the
sake of the good”— these are three forms of evil eye for the real.
— Art, knowledge, morality are means: instead of recogniz­
ing in them the aim of enhancing life, one has associated them
with the antithesis of life, with “God”— also as the revelation of a
higher world which here and there looks down upon us through
them—
“Beautiful and ugly,” “true and false,” “good and evil”—
these distinctions and antagonisms betray certain conditions of
existence and enhancement, not only of man but of any kind of
firm and enduring complex which separates itself from its adver­
sary. The war that is thus created is the essential element: as a
means of separation that strengthens isolation—
299 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Moralistic naturalism: the tracing back of apparently emanci­
pated, supranatural moral values to their “nature” : i.e., to natural
immorality, to natural “utility,” etc.
I might designate the tendency of these reflections as moral­
istic naturalism: my task is to translate the apparently emancipated
and denatured moral values back into their nature— i.e., into their
natural “immorality.”
— N.B. Comparison with Jewish “holiness” and its natural
basis: it is the same with the moral law made sovereign, emanci­
pated from its nature (— to the point of becoming the antithesis
of nature— ).

4. How Virtue Is Made to Dominate
304 (Nov, 1887-March 1888)
Of the ideal of the moralists.60— This treatise deals with the
grand politics of virtue. It is intended for the use of thoue whose
interest must lie in learning, hot how one becomes virtuous, but
how one makes virtuous— how virtue is made to dominate. I even
intend to prove that to desire the one— the domination of virtue—
one absolutely must not desire the other; one automatically
renounces becoming virtuous oneself. This is a great sacrifice: but
such a goal is perhaps sufficient reward for such a sacrifice. Arid
for even greater sacrifices!— And some of the most famous moral­
ists have risked as much. For they had already recognized and
anticipated the truth, which is in this treatise to be taught for the
first time, that one can achieve the domination of virtue only by
the same means ias those by which one can achieve domination of
any kind, in any case not by means of virtue—
This treatise, as already stated, deals with the politics of
virtue: it posits an ideal of these politics, it describes them as
they would have to be, if anything on this earth could be perfect.
Now, no philosopher will be in any doubt as to the type of per­
fection in politics; that is Machiavellianism. But Machiavellianism
pur, sans melange, cru, vert, dans toute sa force, dans toute son
dprete,d7 is superhuman, divine, transcendental, it will never be
achieved by man, at most approximated. Even in this narrower
kind of politics, in the politics of virtue, the ideal seems never to
have been achieved. Even Plato barely touched it. One discovers,

diced and conscious moralists (and that is indeed the name for
such politicians of morality, for every kind of founder of new
moral forces) that show that they too have paid their tribute to
human weakness. They all aspired, at least when they were weary,
to virtue for themselves: first and capital error for a moralist—
who must as such be an immoralist in practice. That he must not
appear to be so is another matter. Or rather, it is not another
matter: such a fundamental self-denial (in moral terms, dissimula­
tion) is part of the canon of the moralist and his most specific
duties: without it he will never attain to his kind of perfection.
Freedom from morality, also from truth, for the sake of that goal
that outweighs every sacrifice: for the sake of the domination of
virtue— that is the canon. Moralists need the gestures of virtue,
also the gestures of truth; their error begins only when they yield
to virtue, when they lose domination over virtue, when they
themselves become moral, become true. A great moralist is, among
other things, necessarily a great actor; his danger is that his dis­
simulation may unintentionally become nature, while it: is his ideal
to keep his esse and his operari68 in a divine way apart; every­
thing he does must be done sub specie bonim— a high, remote,
exacting ideal! A divine ideal! And indeed, it is said that the
moralist imitates in that no less a model than God himself: God,
the greatest of all immoralists in practice, who nonetheless knows
how to remain what he is* the good God—

Cruelty has been refined to tragic pity, so that it is denied

class express something of the conditions of their existence (— at
least of the conditions under which they have prevailed for the
longest tim e), to desire that they should be “virtuous” means:
that they change their character, shed their skin and blot out
their past:
means that they should cease to be distinct:
means that they should begin to resemble one another in their
needs and demands— more clearly: that they should perish—
The will to a single morality is thereby proved to be a tyranny
over other types by that type whom this single morality fits: it is a
destruction or a leveling for the sake of the ruling type (whether
to render the others no longer fearsome or to render them useful).
“Abolition of slavery”— supposedly a tribute to “human dignity,”
in fact a destruction of a fundamentally different type (— the
undermining of its values and happiness— ) .
The qualities in which an opposing race or class is strong are
interpreted as its most evil, worst qualities: for it is with those that
it can harm us (— its “virtues” are defamed and rebaptized— ).
It counts as an objection against a man or people if they harm
us: but from their point of view we are desirable, because we are
such as one can make use of.
The demand for “humanization” (which quite naively believes
itself to possess the formula for “what is human?” ) is a tartuffery,
behind which a quite definite type of man seeks to attain domina­
tion: more exactly, a quite definite instinct, the herd instinct.—
“Human equality” : which is concealed behind the tendency to
make men more and more alike.
“Interestedness” with reference to communal morality. (Arti­

To what extent all kinds of businessmen and the avaricious,
all who have to give and claim credit, find it necessary to become
more and more alike in character and in conception of value:
world trade and exchange of every kind extorts and, as it were,
buys virtue.
The same applies to the state and to every kind of rule by
means of officials and soldiers; likewise science, in order to work
in security and with economy of its forces.— Likewise the priest­
hood.

are practiced against immorality—with what “right”? With no
right whatever: but in accordance with the instinct for self-preser­
vation. These same classes make use of immorality when it serves
their purpose.
316 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The hypocritical show with which all civil institutions are
whitewashed, as if they were products of morality— e.g., marriage;
work; one’s profession; the fatherland; the family; order; law. But
since they are one and all founded on the most mediocre type of
man, as protection against exceptions and exceptional needs, it is
only to be expected that they are full of lies.
317 ( Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
One should defend virtue against the preachers of virtue:
they are its worst enemies. For they teach virtue as an ideal for
everyone', they take from virtue the charm of rareness, inimitable­
ness, exceptionalness and unaverageness— its aristocratic magic.
One should also take a stand against the obdurate idealists who
eagerly knock on all vessels and are satisfied when they ring
hollow: what naivete to demand the great and rare and then to
establish, with rage and misanthropy, that they are absent!— It
is obvious, e.g., that a marriage is worth as much as those whom
it joins together, i.e., that in general it will be something wretched
and inept: no priest, no mayor can make anything else of it.
Virtue has all the instincts of the average man against it: it
is unprofitable, imprudent, it isolates; it is related to passion and
not very accessible to reason; it spoils the character, the head, the
mind— according to the standards of mediocre men; it rouses to
enmity toward order, toward the lies that are concealed in every
order, institution, actuality— it is the worst of vices, if one judges
it by its harmful effect upon others.
— I recognize virtue in that (1) it does not desire to be recog­
nized; (2) it does not presuppose virtue everywhere, but precisely
something else; (3) it does not suffer from the absence of virtue,
but on the contrary regards this as the distancing relationship on
the basis of which there is something to honor in virtue; it does
not communicate itself; (4) it does not propagandize— (5) it
permits no one to judge it, because it is always virtue for itself;

(6) it does precisely all that is generally forbidden: virtue, as I
understand it, is the real vetitum72 within all herd legislation;
(7) in short, it is virtue in the style of the Renaissance, virtu,
moraline-free virtue.78
318 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Above all, gentlemen of virtue, you are not our superiors:
we should like you to be a little more modest: it is a miserable
self-interest and prudence that suggests your virtue to you. And
if you had more strength and courage in you, you would not
reduce yourselves to virtuous nonentities in this way. You make
what you can of yourselves: partly what you must—what your
circumstances force you to— partly what gives you pleasure,
partly what seems useful to you. But if you do only what is in
keeping with your inclinations, or what necessity demands of you,
or what is useful to you, then you should neither praise yourselves
nor let others praise you!— One is a thoroughly small type of man
if one is only virtuous: do not be misled about that! Men who
have been in any way notable were never such virtuous asses:
their innermost instinct, that of their quantum of power, did not
find satisfaction that way: while, with your minimum of power,
nothing can seem wiser to you than virtue. But you have numbers
on your side; and in so far as you play the tyrant, we shall make
war on you—

A virtuous man is a lower species because he is not a “per­

be compared, he has his equals, he must not be an individual—
Reckon up the qualities of the good man: why do they give
us pleasure? Because we have no need to fight against them, be­
cause they impose upon us no mistrust, no need for caution, no
marshalling of forces and severity: our laziness, good nature,

Virtue is under certain circumstances merely an honorable
form of stupidity: who could be ill-disposed toward it on that
account? And this kind of virtue has not been outlived even today.
A kind of sturdy peasant simplicity, which, however, is possible
in all classes and can be encountered only with respect and a
smile, believes even today that everything is in good hands, namely
in the “hands of God”; and when it maintains this proposition
with the same modest certainty as it would that two and two make
four, we others certainly refrain from contradicting. Why disturb
this pure foolishness? Why darken it with our worries about man,
people, goal, future? And even if We wanted to do it, we could
not. They project their own honorable stupidity and goodness
into the heart of things (the old God, deus myops,u still lives
among them!); we others— we read something else into the heart
of things: our own enigmatic nature, our contradictions, our deeper,
more painful, more mistrustful wisdom.
321 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
He who finds virtue easy also laughs at it. It is impossible
to maintain seriousness in virtue: one attains it and leaps beyond it

Virtue is no longer believed in, its power of attraction is gone;
to restore it, someone would have to know how to take it to market
as an unfamiliar form of adventure and excess. It demands too
much extravagance and narrow-mindedness of its believers not to
have the conscience against it today. T o be sure, precisely that may
constitute its new charm for unconscionable and totally unscrupu­
lous people:— it is now what it never was before, a vice.

Virtue is still the most expensive vice: it should remain so!

Virtues are as dangerous as vices in so far as one lets them
rule over one as authorities and laws from without and does not
first produce them out of oneself, as one should do, as one’s most
personal self-defense and necessity, as conditions of precisely our
own existence and growth, which we recognize and acknowledge
independently of whether other men grow with us under similar
or different conditions. This law of the dangerousness of imperson­
ally understood, objective virtue applies also to modesty: many of
the choicest spirits perish through it. The morality of modesty is
the worst form of softening for those souls for which it makes sense
that they should become hard in time.

that are really at work here after they have been hidden for so
long beneath hypocritical names of virtue; out of respect for one’s
“honesty,” which speaks more and more imperiously, one should
unlearn the shame that would like to deny and lie away one’s
natural instincts. It is a measure of strength how far one can divest
oneself of virtue; and a height can be imagined where the concept
“virtue” is so understood that it sounds like virtU, Renaissance
virtue, moraline-free virtue.75 But in the meantime— how distant
we are from this ideal!
The reduction of the domain of morality: a sign of the
progress of this ideal. Wherever one has not yet been capable of
causal thinking, one has thought morally.
328 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
In the end: what have I achieved? Let us not hide from our­
selves this most curious result: I have imparted to virtue a new
charm— the charm of something forbidden. It has our subtlest
honesty against it, it is spiced “cum grano salis"7fl of the sting of
scientific conscience; it smells old-fashioned and antique, so that
at last it lures the refined and makes them inquisitive— in short,
it appears as a vice. Only after we have recognized everything as
lies and appearance do we regain the right to this fairest of false­
hoods, virtue. There is no court of appeal left that could deny
it to us: only by exhibiting virtue as a form of immorality do we
again justify it—it is classified and compared with reference to
its fundamental significance, it is part of the fundamental im­
morality of all existence— as a form of luxury of the first order,
the haughtiest, dearest and rarest form of vice. We have removed
its scowl and its cowl, we have rescued it from the importunity of
the many, we have taken from it its absurd rigidity, its vacant
expression, its stiff false hair, its hieratic muscular system.

5. The Moral Ideal
A. Critique of Ideals
330 ( 1886-1887)
To tackle this in such a way as to abolish the word “ideal” :
critique of desiderata.
331 ( 1883-1888)
Very few are clear as to what the standpoint of desirability,
every “thus it should be but is not” or even “thus it should have
been,” comprises: a condemnation of the total course of things.
For in this course nothing exists in isolation: the smallest things
bear the greatest, upon your little wrongful act stands the entire
structure of the future, every critique of the smallest thing also
condemns the whole. Now, granted that the moral norm, even as
Kant understood it, has never been completely fulfilled and remains
suspended over actuality as a kind of beyond without ever falling
down into it, then morality would contain a judgment concerning
the whole, which, however, still permits the question: whence does
it derive the right to this judgment? How does the part come to
sit as judge over the whole?—
And if this moral judging and dissatisfaction with actuality
were in fact, as has been suggested, an ineradicable instinct, might
this instinct not be one of the ineradicable stupidities and im­
modesties of our species?—
But in saying this we do that which we censure; the stand­
point of desirability, of unauthorized playing-the~judge, is part
of the character of the course of things, as is every injustice and
imperfection—it is precisely our concept of “perfection” which
is never satisfied. Every drive that desires to be satisfied expresses
its dissatisfaction with the present state of things: what? is the
whole perhaps composed of dissatisfied parts, which all have

desiderata in their heads? is the “course of things” perhaps precisely
this “away from here? away from actuality 1” eternal dissatisfaction
itself? is desirability perhaps the driving force itself? is it—deus?18
*

It seems to me important that one should get rid of the all,
the unity, some force, something unconditioned; otherwise one
will never cease regarding it as the highest court of appeal and
baptizing it “God.” One must shatter the all; unlearn respect for
the all; take what we have given to the unknown and the whole and
give it back to what is nearest, what is ours.
When, e.g., Kant says: “Two things70 remain forever worthy
of reverence” (conclusion ,of the [Critique o j \ Practical Reason)
— today we should sooner say: “Digestion is more venerable.”
The all would always bring the old problems with it— “How is
evil possible?” etc. Therefore: there is no all, there is no great
sensorium or inventarium or storehouse of force.
332 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
A man as he ought to be: that sounds to us as insipid as
“a tree as it ought to be.”80
333 ( 1883-1888)
Ethics: or “philosophy of desirability.”— “Things ought to be
different,” “things shall be different” : dissatisfaction would thus be
the germ of ethics.
One could rescue oneself from it, firstly by selecting states in
which one did not have this feeling; secondly by grasping the
presumption and stupidity of it: for to desire that something should
be different from what it is means to desire that everything should
be different—it involves a condemnatory critique of the whole.8*
But life itself is such a desire!

To ascertain what is, as it is, seems something unspeakably
higher and more serious than any “thus it ought to be,” because
the latter, as a piece of human critique and presumption, appears
ludicrous from the start. It expresses a need that desires that the
structure of the world should correspond with our human well­
being; also the will to bring this about as far as possible.
On the other hand, it is only this desire “thus it ought to be”
that has called forth that other desire to know what is. F or the
knowledge of what is, is a consequence of that question: “How? is
it possible? why precisely so?” Wonder at the disagreement between
our desires and the course of the world has led to our learning to
know the course of the world. But perhaps the case is different:
perhaps that “thus it ought to be” is our desire to overcome the
world—
334 (March-June 1888)
Today, when every “man ought to be thus and thus” is spoken
with a grain of irony, when we are altogether convinced that, in
spite of all, one will become only that which one is82 (in spite of
all: that means education, instruction, milieu, chance, and acci­
dent), we have learned to reverse cause and consequence83 in a
curious way in moral matters— nothing perhaps distinguishes us
more completely from the old believers in morality. We no longer
say, e.g.: “Vice is the cause that a man also goes to ruin physio­
logically” ; and just as little: “A man prospers through virtue, it
brings long life and happiness.” Our view is rather that vice and
virtue are not causes but only consequences. One becomes a decent
man because one is a decent man: i.e., because one was bora a
capitalist of good instincts and prosperous circumstances—
If one comes into the world poor, of parents who have
squandered everything and saved nothing, one is “incorrigible,”
which means ripe for prison or the madhouse—
Today we no longer know how to separate moral and physio­
logical degeneration: the former is merely a symptom-complex of
the latter; one is necessarily bad, just as one is necessarily ill—
Bad: here the word expresses a certain incapacity associated
physiologically with the degenerating type: e.g., weakness of will,

insecure and even multiple “personality,” inability to resist reacting
to a stimulus and to “control” oneself, constraint before every
kind of suggestion from the will of another. Vice is not a cause;
vice is a consequence-—
Vice is a somewhat arbitrarily limited concept designed to
express in one word certain consequences of physiological degen­
eration. A universal proposition such as Christianity teaches— “Man
is evil”— would be justified if one were justified in taking the
degenerate type as the normal type of man. But perhaps this is an
exaggeration. To be sure, the proposition is correct wherever
Christianity prospers and stays on top: for that demonstrates a
morbid soil, a field for degeneration.
335 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
One cannot have too much respect for man when one sees
how well he understands how to fight his way through, to endure,
to turn circumstances to his own use, to overthrow ids adversaries;
but when one looks at his desires he appears the absurdest of
animals—
It is as if he required a playground of cowardice, laziness,
weakness, lusciousness, submissiveness for the recreation of his
strong and manly virtues: observe human desiderata, his “ideals.”
Desiring man recovers from the eternally valuable in him, from
his deeds: he employs nothingness; the absurd, the valueless, the
childish for his recovery. The spiritual poverty and lack of in­
ventiveness of this inventive and resourceful animal are terrible.
The “ideal” is, as it were, the penalty man pays for the tremendous
expenditure he has to meet in all actual and pressing tasks. When
reality ceases, dream, weariness, weakness come along: “the ideal”
is simply a form of dream, weariness, weakness—
The strongest and the most powerless natures become equal
when this condition overtakes them: they deify the cessation of
work, of war, of passion, of tension, of oppositions, of “reality”
in summa—the struggle for knowledge, the exertion of knowledge.
“Innocence” : that is their name for the ideal state of stupe­
faction; “blessedness” : the ideal state of sloth; “love” : the ideal
state of the herd animal that no longer wants to have enemies.
Therewith one has raised everything that debases and lowers man
to an ideal.84

Desire magnifies that which one desires; it grows even by not
being fulfilled— the greatest ideas are those that have been created

fojf a thing grows, the more value we ascribe to that thing:85 if
‘‘moral values” have become the highest values, this betrays the
fact that the moral ideal has been the least fulfilled86 ( —to that
extent it represented a "beyond all suffering,” as a means to blessed­
ness). Mankind has embraced, with ever-increasing ardor, nothing
but clouds: finally it called its despair, its impotence “God”—

The very obscure and arbitrary idea that mankind has a single
task to perform, that it is moving as a whole toward some goal,

becomes a “fixed idea”—
This mankind is not a whole: it is an inextricable multiplicity
of ascending and descending life-processes— it does not have a
youth followed by maturity and finally by old age; the strata are
twisted and entwined together—and in a few millennia there may
still be even younger types of man than we can show today.
Decadence, on the other hand, belongs to all epochs of mankind:

When Christian prejudice was a power, this question did not
exist: meaning lay in the salvation of the individual soul; whether
mankind could endure for a long or a short time did not come
into consideration* The best Christians desired that it should end
as soon as possible— concerning that which was needful to the
individual there was no doubt—
The task of every present individual was the same as for a
future individual in any kind of future: value, meaning, domain of
values were fixed, unconditional, eternal, one with God— That
which deviated from this eternal type was sinful, devilish, con­
demned—
For each soul, the gravitational center of valuation was placed
within itself: salvation or damnation! The salvation of the immortal
soul! Extremest form of personalization— For every soul there
was only one perfecting; only one ideal; only one way to redemp­
tion— Extremest form of equality of rights, tied to an optical
magnification of one’s own importance to the point of insanity—
Nothing but insanely important souls, revolving about themselves
with a frightful fear—
♦

No man believes now in this absurd self-inflation: and we
have sifted our wisdom through a sieve of contempt. Nevertheless,
the optical habit of seeking the value of man in his approach to
an ideal man remains undisturbed: fundamentally, one upholds
the perspective of personalization as well as equality of rights
before the ideal. In summa: one believes one knows what the
ultimate desideratum is with regard to the ideal man—
This belief, however, is only the consequence of a dreadful
deterioration through the Christian ideal: as one at once discovers
with every careful examination of the “ideal type.” One believes
one knows, first that an approach to one type is desirable; sec­
ondly, that one knows what this type is like; thirdly, that every

deviation from this type is a regression, an inhibition, a loss of
force and power in man—
To dream of conditions in which this perfect man will be in
the vast majority: even our socialists, even the Utilitarians have not
gone farther than this.—
In this way a goal seems to have entered the development of
mankind: at any rate, the belief in progress towards the ideal is
the only form in which a goal in history is thought of today. In
sunima: one has transferred the arrival of the “kingdom of God”
into the future, on earth, in human form— but fundamentally one
has held fast to the belief in the old ideal—

Rousseau’s concept of nature, as if “nature” were freedom, good­

morality fundamentally.— Collect together passages to see what

Goethe wanted from them— why he admired Spinoza— . Com­

all that suffers and is ill-constituted (even history, e.g., Thierry’s) :
it is still the cult of the Christian moral ideal.

rant, physiological characteristics of idealists of this sort— : the
anemic ideal. Under certain circumstances it can be the ideal of
those who represent the first ideal, the pagan (thus Goethe sees
his “saint” in Spinoza).

absurd, worse, poorer, more deceptive than we suppose or desire

— that one requires a perpetual way of living. What is achieved
here?— The Buddhist type or the perfect cow.
This standpoint is possible only when no moral fanaticism
prevails, i.e., when evil is hated, not for its own sake, but only
because it opens the way to states that are harmful to us (unrest,
work, care, entanglements, dependence).
This is the Buddhist standpoint: here sin is not hated, here
the concept “sin” is lacking.

b. The inconsistent type. One wages war against evil— one
believes that war for the sake of goodness does not have the moral
consequences or effect on the character that war otherwise brings
with it (and owing to which one detests it as evil). In fact, such a
war against evil does much more fundamental harm than any kind
of hostility of one person against another; and usually “the person”
is reinterpolated as the opponent, at least in imagination (the devil,
evil spirits, etc.). A hostile attitude of watching and spying on
everything in us that is bad and might have a bad origin ends
in a most tormented and anxious constitution: so that "miracles,”
reward, ecstasy, transcendent solutions now become desirable—

defamation of ideals that oppose it, (e) by a mendacious doctrine

If one discovers all the defensive and protective measures by
which an ideal maintains itself, is it then refuted? It has employed
the means by which all living things live and grow— they are one
and all "immoral.”
My insight: all the forces and drives by virtue of which life
and growth exist lie under the ban of morality: morality as the
instinct to deny life. One must destroy morality if one is to liberate
life.

Tendency of moral development— Everyone desires that
no doctrine or valuation of things should come into favor but
that through which he himself prospers. The basic tendency of the
weak and mediocre of all ages is, consequently, to weaken and
pull down the stronger: chief means, the moral judgment. The
attitude of the stronger toward the weaker is branded; the higher
states of the stronger acquire an evil name.
The struggle of the many against the few, the commonplace
against the rare, the weak against the strong—one of the subtlest
interruptions of this struggle occurs when the choice, subtle, more
fastidious present themselves as the weak and repudiate the coarser
means of power—

an instinct; it flatters man to be obedient where he is only an

Morality as a means of seduction.— “Nature is good, for a
wise and good God is its cause. Who, then, is responsible for the
‘corruption of mankind’? Its tyrants and seducers, the ruling
orders— they must be destroyed”— : Rousseau’s logic (compare
Pascal’s logic, which lays the responsibility on original sin).
Compare the related logic of Luther. In both cases a pretext
is sought to introduce an insatiable thirst for revenge as a moralreligious duty. Hatred for the ruling order seeks to sanctify itself—
(the “sinfulness of Israel” : foundation of the power of the priest).
Compare the related logic of Paul. It is always God’s cause in
which these reactions come forth, the cause of right, of humanity,
etc. In the case of Christ, the rejoicing of the people appears as
the cause of his execution; an anti-priestly movement from the
first. Even in the case of the anti-Semites it is still the same arti­
fice; to visit condemnatory judgments upon one’s opponent and
to reserve to oneself the role of retributive justice.

Course of the struggle: the fighter tries to transform his oppo­

faith in himself to such a degree that he may have courage for
the “good cause” (as if he were the good cause); as if his oppo­
nent were attacking reason, taste, virtue—
The belief he needs as the strongest means of defense and
attack is a belief in himself, which, however, knows how to mis­
understand itself as belief in God:— never to imagine the advan­
tages and utility of victory, but always victory for the sake of
victory, as “the victory of God”— . Every little community (even
an individual) that finds itself involved in struggle tries to convince
itself: “We have good taste, good judgment, and virtue on our
side.”— The struggle compels to such an exaggeration of self­
esteem—

deutscher*8— ), one should not demand that it be the ideal: for
one therewith takes from it its privileged character. One should
have it in order to distinguish oneself, not in order to level oneself.
How comes it, this notwithstanding, that most idealists at
once propagandize for their ideal, as if they could have no right to
the ideal if everyone did not recognize it?— This, e.g., is what
all those brave little women do who permit themselves to learn
Latin and mathematics. What compels them? The instinct of the
herd, I fear, terror of the herd: they fight for the “emancipation
of women” because it is under the form of a generous activity,
under the banner of “For others,” that they can most prudently
forward their own little private separatism.
Prudence of idealists to be only missionaries and “representa­
tives” of an ideal: they “transfigure” themselves in the eyes of
those who believe in disinterestedness and heroism. Whereas: true
heroism consists, in not fighting under the banner of sacrifice,
devotion, disinterestedness, but in not fighting at all— “This is
what I am; this is what / want:— you can go to hell!”—

ideological unnaturalness that rejects this doubleness— that teaches
that it is a higher thing to be efficient on only one side? Whence
comes the hemiplegia of virtue, the invention of the good man?—
The demand is that man should castrate himself,, of those
instincts with which he can be an enemy, can cause harm, can be
angry, can demand revenge—
This unnaturalness corresponds, then, to that dualistic con­
ception of a merely good and a merely evil crcature (God, spirit,
m an); in the former are summarized all the positive, in the latter
all the negative forces, intentions, states.—
Such a manner of valuing believes itself to be “idealistic” ; it
does not doubt that, in the conception of “the good,” it has posited
a supreme desideratum. At its peak, it imagines a state in which
all that is evil is annulled and in which only good creatures actually
rfemain. It does not even consider it settled that this antithesis
of good and evil is conditional on the existence of both; on the
contrary, the latter should vanish and the former remain, the one
has a right to exist, the other ought not to be there at all—
What is it really that desires this?-----Much labor has been expended in all ages, and especially in
the Christian ages, to reduce mankind to this half-sided efficiency,
to the “good” : even today there is no lack of those deformed and
weakened by the church for whom this object coincides with
“humanization” in general, or with the “will of God,” or with
“salvation of the soul.” The essential demand here is that mankind
should do nothing evil, that it should under no circumstances do
harm or desire to do harm. The way to achieve this is: the cas­
tration of all possibility of enmity, the unhinging of all the instincts
of ressentiment, “peace of soul” as a chronic disease.
This mode of thought, with which a definite type of man is
bred, starts from an absurd presupposition: it takes good and
evil for realities that contradict one another (not as complementary
value concepts, which would be the truth), it advises taking the
side of the good, it desires that the good should renounce and
oppose the evil down to its ultimate roots— it therewith actually
denies life, which has in all its instincts both Yes and No. Not
that it grasps this: it dreams, on the contrary, that it is getting
back to wholeness, to unity, to strength of life: it thinks it will
be a state of redemption when the inner anarchy, the unrest
between those opposing value drives, is at last put an end to*—
Perhaps there has never before been a more dangerous ideology,

book t w o :

a greater mischief in psychologies, than this will to good: one
has reared the most repellent type, the unfree man, the bigot; one
has taught that only as a bigot is one on the right path to godhood, only the bigot’s way is God’s way.
And even here, life is still in the right—life, which does not
know how to separate Yes from No— : what good is it to hold
with all one’s strength that war is evil, not to do harm, not to desire
to negate! one wages war nonetheless! one cannot do otherwise!
The good man who has renounced evil, afflicted, as seems to him
desirable, with that hemiplegia of virtue, in no way ceases to wage
war, have enemies, say No and act No. The Christian, for example,
hates “sin”! Precisely because of his faith in a moral antithesis of
good and evil the world has become for him overfull of things
that must be hated and eternally combated. “The good man” sees
himself as if surrounded by evil, and under the continual onslaught
of evil his eye grows keener, he discovers evil in all his dreams and
desires; and so he ends, quite reasonably, by considering nature
evil, mankind corrupt, goodness an act of grace (that is, as impossi­
ble for m an). In summa: he denies life, he grasps that when good
is the supreme value it condemns life—
Therewith he ought to consider his ideology of good and
evil as refuted. But one cannot refute an illness* And so he con­
ceives another life!—

The concept of power, whether of a god or of a man, always
includes both the ability to help and the ability to harm. Thus
it is with the Arabs; thus with the Hebrews. Thus with all strong
races.

from the power for the other into a dualism— In this way, morality
becomes the poisoner of life—

194

THE W ILL

a certain light in which they acquire value? Does the value of
these qualities reside in them or in the use and advantage to which
they lead (appear to lead, are expected to lead)?
Naturally, I do not mean by this an antithesis between ego and
alter91 in the judgment: the question is whether these qualities are
supposed to have value on account of their consequences, either
for the bearer of these qualities or for the environment, for society,
for “humanity” : or whether they have value in themselves—
In other words: is it utility that bids one condemn, combat,
deny the opposite qualities (—untrustworthiness, falseness, per­
versity, lack of self-confidence, inhumanity— )? Is the essence of
such qualities condemned, or only their consequences?— In other
words: would it be desirable that men with these latter qualities
should not exist?— In any event, that is what is believed— But
here lies the error, the short-sightedness, the narrow-mindedness
of nook egoism.
Otherwise expressed: would it be desirable to create condi­
tions in which all the advantage would be with the righteous— so
that the opposite natures and instincts would be discouraged and
slowly die out?
This is at bottom a question of taste and of aesthetics: would
it be desirable that the “most respectable,” i.e., most tedious,
species of man should survive? the square,92 the virtuous, the
worthies, the good people, the straight, the “oxen”?93
If one imagines the tremendous abundance of the “others”
gone, then even the righteous no longer has a right to existence: he
is no longer necessary— and here one grasps that it is only coarse
utility that has brought such an insufferable virtue into honor.
Perhaps desirability lies on precisely the other side: to create
conditions in which the “righteous man” is reduced to the modest
position of a “useful tool”— as the “ideal herd animal,” at best
herdsman: in short, conditions in which he no longer stands
among the higher orders which require other qualities.

take over and over again: he has made a means to life into a
standard of life; instead of discovering the standard in the highest
enhancement of life itself, in the problem of growth and exhaus­
tion, he has employed the means to a quite distinct kind of life
to exclude all other forms of life, in short to criticize and select
life. I.e., man finally loves the means for their own sake and forgets
they are means: so that they enter his consciousness as aims, as
standards for aims— i.e., a certain species of man treats the con­
ditions of its existence as conditions which ought to be imposed
as a law, as “truth,” “good,” “perfection” : it tyrannizes— It is a
form of faith, of instinct, that a species of man fails to perceive
its conditionality, its relativity to other species. At least, it seems
to be all over for a species of man (people, races) when it becomes
tolerant, allows equal rights and no longer thinks of wanting to be

to be discovered as the root of all moral impulse hitherto— only
a thinker denuded of all historical instinct, and one who had eluded
in the strangest way even that strong schooling in history undergone
by the Germans from Herder to Hegel, could have attained to this
degree of absurdity and naivete.

dered, e.g., at the sight of Luther: what force and what insipid
backwoodsman problems! (at a time when in France the bold and
light-hearted skepticism of a Montaigne was already possible!) Or
when I see anyone halted, as a result of some stupid accident, at
something less than he might have become. Or especially at the
idea of the lot of mankind, as when I observe with anguish and
contempt the politics of present-day Europe, which is, under all
circumstances, also working at the web of the future of all men.

Pity a squandering of feeling, a parasite harmful to moral
health,99 “it cannot possibly be our duty to increase the evil in the
world.” If one does good merely out of pity, it is oneself one really
does good to, and not the other. Pity does not depend upon maxims
but upon affects;100 it is pathological. The suffering of others infects
us, pity is an infection.

No egoism at all exists that remains within itself and does not
encroach— consequently, that “allowable,” “morally indifferent”
egoism of which you speak does not exist at all.

“Life always lives at the expense of other life”—he who does not

As every drive lacks intelligence, the viewpoint of “utility”
cannot exist for it. Every drive, in as much as it is active, sacrifices
force and other drives: finally it is checked; otherwise it would
destroy everything through its excessiveness. Therefore: the “unegoistic,” self-sacrificing, imprudent, is nothing special— it is com­
mon to all the drives— they do not consider the advantage of the
whole ego (because they do not consider at all!), they act contrary
to our advantage, against the ego: and often for the ego— innocent
in both cases!
373 (March-June 1888)
Origin of moral values.101— Egoism is of as much value as
the physiological value of him who possesses it.
Every individual consists of the whole course of evolution
(and not, as morality imagines, only of something that begins at
birth). If he represents the ascending course of mankind, then his
value is in fact extraordinary; and extreme care may be taken over
the preservation and promotion of his development. (It is concern
for the future promised him that gives the well-constituted individ­
ual such an extraordinary right to egoism.) If he represents the
descending course, decay, chronic sickening, then he has little
value: and the first demand of fairness is for him to take as
little space, force, and sunshine as possible away from the wellconstituted. In this case, it is the task of society to suppress egoism
(— which sometimes expresses itself in absurd, morbid and rebelM1T h is section w as put to use by N ietzsche in Twilight, section 33

lious ways), whether it be a question of individuals or of whole
decaying and atrophying classes of people. A doctrine and religion
of “love,” of suppression of self-affirmation, of patience, endurance,
helpfulness, of cooperation in word and deed, can be of the highest
value within such classes, even from the point of view of the
rulers: for it suppresses feelings of rivalry, of ressentiment, of envy
—the all too natural feelings of the underprivileged— it even deifies
a life of slavery, subjection, poverty, sickness, and inferiority for
them under the ideal of humility and obedience. This explains why
the ruling classes (or races) and individuals have at all tinies up­
held the cult of selflessness, the gospel of the lowly, the “God on
the cross.”
The preponderance of an altruistic mode of valuation is the
consequence of an instinct that one is ill-constituted. The value
judgment here is at bottom: “I am not worth much” : a merely
physiological value judgment; even more clearly: the feeling of
impotence, the absence of the great affirmative feelings of power
(in muscles, nerves, ganglia). This value judgment is translated
into a moral or a religious judgment, according to the culture of
this class (— the predominance of religious and moral judgments
is always a sign of a lower culture— ): it seeks to establish itself
by relating to spheres in which it recognizes the concept “value”
in general. The interpretation by means of which the Christian
sinner believes he understands himself is an attempt to justify his
lack of power and self-confidence: he would rather consider him­
self guilty than feel bad for no reason: it is a symptom of decay
to require interpretations of this sort at all.
In other cases, the underprivileged man seeks the reason not
in his “guilt” (as the Christian does), but in society: the socialist,
the anarchist, the nihilist— in as much as they find their existence
something of which someone must be guilty, they are still the
closest relations of the Christian, who also believes he can better
endure his sense of sickness and ill-constitutedness by finding
someone whom he can make responsible for it. The instinct of
revenge and ressentiment appears here in both cases as a means
of enduring, as the instinct of self-preservation: just as is the
preference for altruistic theory and practice.
Hatred of egoism, whether it be one’s own (as with Chris­
tians) or another’s (as with socialists), is thus revealed as a value
judgment under the predominating influence of revenge; on the
other hand, as an act of prudence for the self-preservation of the

202

T H E W I L L TO POW ER

suffering by an enhancement of their feelings of cooperation and
solidarity—
Finally, even that release of ressentiment in the judging, re­
jecting, punishing of egoism (one’s own or another’s) is also, as
already indicated, an instinct of self-preservation on the part of
the underprivileged. In summa: the cult of altruism is a specific
form of egoism that regularly appears under certain physiological
conditions.
When the socialist with a line indignation demands “justice,”
“right,” “equal rights,” he is merely acting under the impress of
his inadequate culture that cannot explain why he is suffering: on
the other hand, he enjoys himself; if he felt better he would re­
frain from crying out: he would then find pleasure in other things.
The same applies to the Christian: he condemns, disparages,
curses the “world”— himself not excluded. But that is no reason
for taking his clamor seriously. In both cases we are in the presence
of invalids who feel better for crying out, for whom defamation is
a relief.
374 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
Every society has the tendency to reduce its opponents to
caricatures— at least in imagination— and, as it were, to starve
them. Such a caricature is, e.g., our “criminal.” Within the
aristocratic Roman order of values, the Jew was reduced to a
caricature. Among artists, the “philistine and bourgeois” become
caricatures; among the pious, the godless; among aristocrats, the
man of the people. Among immoralists it is the moralist: Plato,
for example, becomes a caricature in my hands.
375 ( 1883-1888)
All the drives and powers that morality praises seem to me
to be essentially the same as those it defames and rejects: e.g.,
justice as will to power, will to truth as a tool of the will to
power.

377 ( 1883-1888)
F a l s i t y Every sovereign instinct has the others for its tools,
retainers, flatterers: it never lets itself be called by its ugly name:
and it countenances no praise in which it is not also praised in­
directly. All praise and blame in general crystallizes around every
sovereign instinct to form a rigorous order and etiquette. This is
one of the causes of falsity.
Every instinct that struggles for mastery but finds itself under
a yoke requires for itself, as strengthening and as support for its
self-esteem, all the beautiful names and recognized values: so,
as a rule, it ventures forth under the name of the “master” it is
combatting and from whom it wants to get free (e.g., the fleshly
desires or the desires for power under the dominion of Christian
values).— This is the other cause of falsity.
Perfect naivete reigns in both cases: the falsity does not be­
come conscious. It is a sign of a broken instinct when man sees
the driving force and its “expression” (“ the mask” ) as separate
things— a sign of self-contradiction, and victorious far less often.
Absolute innocence in bearing, word, affect, a “good conscience”
in falsity, the certainty with which one grasps the greatest and
most splendid words and postures—all this is necessary for victory.
In the other case: when one has extreme clearsightedness one
needs the genius of the actor and tremendous training in selfcontrol if one is to achieve victory. That is why priests are the
most skillful conscious hypocrites; then princes, whom rank and
ancestry have endowed with a kind of acting ability. Thirdly, men

things by their right names, that it is very highly probable that

“Thou shalt not lie” : one demands truthfulness. But acknowl­
edgement of the factual (refusal to let oneself be lied to) has
been greatest precisely among liars: they have recognized that
just this popular “truthfulness” is not a fact. What is said is always
too much or too little: the demand that one should denude one­
self with every word one says is a piece of naivet6.
One says what one thinks, one is “truthful,”,only under certain
conditions: namely, that one is understood (inter pares),1?* and
understood with good will (once again inter pares). One conceals
oneself in presence of the unfamiliar; and he who wants to attain
something says what he would like to have thought of him, but
not what he thinks. ( “The powerful always lie.” )

The great nihilistic counterfeiting through artful misuse of
moral values:
a. Love as depersonalization; also pity.
b. Only the most depersonalized intellect (“the philosopher” )
knows the truth, “the true being and nature of things.”
c. The genius, the great human beings, are great because
they do not seek their own advantage: the value of a man increases
in proportion as he denies himself.
d. Art as the work of the “pure free-willed subject” ; mis­
understanding of “objectivity.”
e. Happiness as the end of life: virtue as means to an end.
The pessimistic condemnation of life by Schopenhauer is a
moral one. Transference of herd standards into the realm of meta­
physics.
The “individuum” meaningless, necessitating an origin in the

science has not understood the individuum: he comprises the en­
tirety of life hitherto in one development, and is not its result.

1. Systematic falsification of history; so that it may provide
the proof of moral valuation:
a. decline of a people and corruption;10®
b. rise of a people and virtue;
c. zenith of a people ( “its culture” ) as consequence of
moral elevation.
2. Systematic falsification of great human beings, the great
creators, the great epochs:
one desires that faith should be the distinguishing mark
of the great: but slackness, skepticism, “immorality,” the
right to throw of! a faith, belong to greatness (Caesar, also
Homer, Aristophanes, Leonardo, Goethe). One always sup­
presses the main thing, their “freedom of will”—
381 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Great lie in history: as if the corruption of the church were
the cause of the Reformation! Only pretext and self-deception on

382 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
Schopenhauer interpreted high intellectuality as liberation
from the will; he did not want to see the freedom from moral
prejudice which is part of the emancipation of the great spirit, the
typical immorality of the genius; he artfully posited the only thing
he held in honor, the moral value of “depersonalization,” as the
condition of spiritual activity, of “objective” viewing. “Truth,”
even in art, appears after the withdrawal of the will—
I see a fundamentally different valuation cutting across all
the moral idiosyncrasies: I know nothing of such an absurd dis­
tinction between “genius” and the moral and immoral world of
the will. The moral man is a lower species than the immoral, a
weaker species; indeed—he is a type in regard to morality, but

not a type in himself; a copy, a good copy at best— the measure
of his value lies outside him. I assess a man by the quantum of
power and abundance of his will: not by its enfeeblement and
extinction; I regard a philosophy which teaches denial of the will
as a teaching of defamation and slander— I assess the power of a
will by how much resistance, pain, torture it endures and knows
how to turn to its advantage; I do not account the evil and painful
character of existence a reproach to it, but hope rather that it will
one day be more evil and painful than hitherto— 107
The high point of the spirit imagined by Schopenhauer was
to attain to the recognition that there is no meaning in anything,
in short, to recogniie what the good man already instinctively
does— He denies the possibility of a higher kind of intellect—he
took his insight for a non plus ultra. Here spirituality is placed
much lower than goodness; its highest value (e.g., as art) would
be to urge and prepare moral conversion: absolute domination of
moral values.—
Beside Schopenhauer I would characterize Kant: nothing
Greek, absolutely antihistorical (his passage on the French Revo­
lution) and a moral fanatic (Goethe’s passage on radical evil).
Saintliness was in the background in his case, too.

The logic is: the desires often produce great misfortune—
consequently they are evil, reprehensible. A man must free himself
from them: otherwise he cannot be a good man—
This is the same logic as: “if thine eye offend thee, pluck it
out.” In the particular case in which that dangerous “innocent
from the country,” the founder of Christianity, recommended this
practice to his disciples, the case of sexual excitation, the conse­
quence is, unfortunately, not only the loss of an organ but the
emasculation of a man’s character— And the same applies to
the moralist’s madness that demands, instead of the restraining of
the passions, their extirpation. Its conclusion is always: only the
castrated man is a good man.
Instead of taking into service the great sources of strength,
those impetuous torrents of the soul that are so often dangerous
and overwhelming, and economizing them, this most shortsighted
and pernicious mode of thought, the moral mode of thought,
wants to make them dry tap.108
384 ( 1885-1886)
Overcoming of the affects?— No, if what is implied is their
weakening ana extirpation. But putting them into service: which
may also mean subjecting them to a protracted tyranny (not only
as an individual, but as a community, race, etc.). A t last they are
confidently granted freedom again: they love us as good servants
and go voluntarily wherever our best interests lie.

in rebus moralibus, 109 that the “good man,” and nothing but the
“good man,” is something desirable— and that the course of human
evolution is directed toward the survival of the “good man” only
(and that one must bend all one’s efforts in that direction— ).
This is in the highest degree an uneconomic thought and, as
stated, the acme of naivete, nothing but the expression of the
pleasing effect produced by the “good man” (— he arouses no fear,
he permits one to relax, he gives what one is able to take).110
From a superior viewpoint one desires the contrary: the
ever-increasing dominion of evil, the growing emancipation of
man from the narrow and fear-ridden bonds of morality, the in­
crease of force, in order to press the mightiest natural powers—
the affects— into service.

zation, it was precisely the affects of love, goodness, pity, even
those of justice, magnanimity, heroism, that were necessarily
misunderstood:111
It is richness in personality, abundance in oneself, over­
flowing and bestowing, instinctive good health and affirmation of
oneself, that produce great sacrifice and great love: it is strong and
godlike selfhood from which these affects grow, just as surely as
do the desire to become master, encroachment, the inner certainty
of having a right to everything. What according to common ideas
are opposite dispositions are rather owe disposition; and if one
is not firm and brave within oneself, one has nothing to bestow
and cannot stretch Out one’s hand to protect and support-----How Was one able so to transform these instincts that man
thought valuable that which was directed against his self? when
he sacrificed his self tb another self. Oh the psychological wretched­
ness and mendaciousness that has hitherto laid down the law in
the church and in church-infected philosophy!
If man is sinful through and through, then he ought only
to hate himself. Fundamentally, he would have to treat his fellow
men on the same basis as he treats himself; charity needs to be
justified—its justification lies in the fact that God has commanded
it.— It follows from this, that all the natural instincts of man
(the instinct of love, etc.) appear to be forbidden in themselves
and only after they have been denied are they restored to their
rights on the basis of obedience to God— Pascal, the admirable
logician of Christianity, went so far! consider his relations to his
sister. “Not to make oneself love”112 seemed Christian to him.

My final proposition is: that the actual man represents a
much higher value than the “desirable” man of any ideal hitherto;
that all “desiderata” with reference to man have been absurd and
dangerous excesses through which a single type of man tried to
establish his conditions of preservation and growth as a law for
all mankind; that every “desideratum”.-of this kind ever brought
into a position of dominance has reduced the value of man, his
strength, his certainty of the future; that the nook-intellectuality
and poverty of spirit of man is most apparent, even today, when
he desires; that man’s ability to posit values has hitherto been too
little developed for him to be just, not merely to the “desirable”
values, but to the real values of man; that the ideal has hitherto
been the actual force for disparaging the world and man, the

Thought about the most universal subjects is always behind
the times: the ultimate "desiderata” for mankind, for example,
have never really been grasped as a problem by philosophers* They
all naively postulate the “improvement” of man as if an intuition
answered for us the question why we ought to “improve.” To
what extent is it desirable that man should become more virtuous?
or cleverer? or happier? Provided we do not already know the
“wherefore” of mankind, such an outlook has no meaning; and if
one desires one of these things* who knows, perhaps one is pre­
cluded from desiring the others. Is an increase in virtuousness
compatible with an increase in cleverness and insight? Dubito;113
only too often I shall have occasion to show the reverse. Has
virtuousness as a goal not hitherto been in the most rigorous sense
incompatible with being happy? does it not, on the contrary, re­
quire misfortune, self-denial and self-mistreatment as a necessary
means? And if the deepest insight were the goal, would one not
then have to renounce the increase of happiness? and choose
danger, adventure, mistrust, seduction as the road to insight?—
And if one desires happiness, well, perhaps one has to become one
of the “poor in spirit.”
394 (March-June 1888)
The universal deception and cheating in the realm of socalled moral improvement.— We do not believe that a man will
become another if he is not that other already; i.e., if he is not,
as is often the case, a multiplicity of persons, at least the embryos
of persons. In this case, one can bring a different role into the
foreground and draw “the former man” back— The aspect is
changed, not the essence— That someone ceases to perform
certain actions is a mere jatum brutum114 that permits the most
various interpretations. It is not always the case that the habit of
a certain act is broken, the ultimate reason for it removed. He
who is a criminal through fate and facility unlearns nothing, but
learns more and more: and a long abstinence even acts as a tonic
to his talent—

THE W ILL

TO PO W ER

For society, to be sure, all that is of interest is precisely that
someone no longer performs certain actions: to this end it removes
him from those conditions in which he can perform certain actions;
that is wiser, in any event, than to attempt the impossible, namely,
to disrupt the fatality by which he is thus and thus. The church—
and in this it has done nothing but succeed and inherit from the
philosophy of antiquity—proceeding from a different standard
and desiring to save a “soul,” the “eternal destiny” of a soul, first
believes in the expiatory power of punishment and then in the
obliterating power of forgiveness: both are deceptions of religious
prejudice— punishment does not expiate, forgiveness does not ex­
tinguish, what is done is not undone. That someone forgets some­
thing is certainly not evidence that something has ceased to exist—
A deed produces its consequences, within the man and out­
side the man, regardless of whether it is considered as punished,
“expiated;” “forgiven” and “extinguished,” regardless of whether
the church has in the meantime promoted the doer to a saint. The
church believes in things that do not exist, in “souls;” it believes in
effects that dc not exist, in divine effects; it believes in states that
do not exist, in sin, in redemption, in the salvation of the soul: it
stays everywhere on the surface, at signs, gestures, words to which
it gives an arbitrary meaning. It possesses a thoroughly thought-out
method of psychological counterfeiting.

— “Illness makes men better” : this famous opinion, which
one encounters throughout the centuries, in the mouth of the
sage as often as in the mouth and maw of the people, makes one
wonder. As to whether it is valid, one would like to ask: were
morality and illness originally connected, perhaps? The “improve­
ment of man,” regarded as a whole, e.g., the undeniable softening,
humanizing, mellowing of the European within the last millennium
— is it perhaps the result of long hidden and mysterious suffering
and failure, abstinence, stunting? Has “illness” made the European
“better”? Or, in other words; is our morality—our modern sensi­
tive European morality, which may be compared with the morality
of the Chinese—the expression of a physiological regression?—
For one cannot deny that every period in history in which
“man” has shown himself in exceptional splendor and power at
once assumed an impetuous, dangerous, and eruptive character

under which humanity fared ill; and perhaps in those cases in
which it seems otherwise, all that was lacking was the courage or
subtlety to take psychology into the depths and to find there, too,
the universal law; “the healthier, stronger, richer, more fruitful,
more enterprising a man feels, the more ‘immoral’ he will be,
too.” A painful thought! in which one certainly ought not to
indulge! If, however, one goes along with it for just a few moments,
how astonishing the future seems then! What would then be paid
for more dearly than precisely that which we are promoting with
all our strength—the humanizing, the “improvement,” the grow­
ing “civilization” of man? Nothing would be more costly than
virtue: for one would in the end have turned the earth into a
hospital: and ultimate wisdom would be “everyone as everyone
else’s nurse.” To be sure, one would then possess that muchdesired “peace on earth”! But how little “delight in each other”!
How little beauty, high spirits, daring, danger! How few “works”
for the sake of which life on earth is Worth while! And, alas, no
more “deeds” whatever! All great works and deeds that have re­
mained and have not been washed away by the waters of time—
were they not all in the profoundest sense immoralities?—
396 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
The priests— and With them the semi-priests, the philosophers
— have at all times called true any teaching whose educative effect
was beneficial or seemed beneficial— which “improved.” In this
they resemble a naive quack and miracle man of the people, who,
because he has used a poison as a cure, denies it is a poison—
“By their fruits shall ye know them— namely, Our ‘truths’ ” : that
has been the reasoning of the priests to this day. With fateful
results, they have expended their subtlety to make the “proof of
power” (or “from their fruits” ) pre-eminent, even decisive, above
all other forms of proof. “What makes good must be good; what
is good cannot lie”— that is their relentless conclusion— : “what
bears good fruit must be true: there is no other criterion of truth”—
But if “making better” counts as an argument, then making
worse must count as a refutation. One can prove an error to be
an error by testing the lives of those who espouse it: a mistake, a
vice can refute— This most indecent form of opposition, from
behind and below, the doglike form of opposition, has not died
out either: the priests, in so far as they are psychologists, have

214

never discovered anything more interesting than to sniff at the
secrets of their adversaries— they demonstrate their Christianity
by looking about the “world” for filth. Especially with the first
men of the world, with the “geniuses” : one will remember how
Goethe has been attacked in Germany at all times (Klopstock
and Herder were the first to provide a “good example” of this—
kind sticks to kind).
397 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
One must be very immoral in order to make morals by
deeds— The means of the moralist are the most terrible means
that have ever been employed; he who has not the courage for
immorality in deeds is fit for anything, but he is not fit to be a
moralist.
Morality is a menagerie; its presupposition is that iron bars
can be more profitable than freedom, even for the prisoners; its
other presupposition is that there exist animal-trainers who are not
afraid of terrible means—who know how to handle red-hot iron.
This frightful species which takes up the fight against the wild
animal is called “priest.”
*
Man, imprisoned in an iron cage of errors, became a carica­
ture of man, sick, wretched, ill-disposed toward himself, full of
hatred for the impulses of life, full of mistrust of all that is beauti­
ful and happy in life, a walking picture of misery: this artificial,
arbitrary, recent abortion that the priests have pulled up out of
their soil, the “sinner” : how shall we be able, in spite of all, to
justify this phenomenon?
*
In order to be fair to morality, we must put two zoological
concepts in its place: taming of the beast and breeding of a
particular species.
The priests have pretended at all times that they want to
“improve”— But we others would laugh if an animal-trainer spoke
of his “improved” animals. In most cases, the taming of a beast
is achieved through the harming of a beast: the moral man, too, is
not a better man but only a weaker one. But he is less harmful— 115

What I want to make clear by all the means in my power:
a.
that there is no worse confusion than the confusion of
breeding with taming: which is what has been done— Breeding,
as I understand it, is a means of storing up the tremendous forces
of mankind so that the generations can build upon the work of
their forefathers—not only outwardly, but inwardly, organically
growing out of them and becoming something stronger—
b,
that it is extraordinarily dangerous to believe that man­
kind as a whole will progress and grow stronger if individuals
become flabby, equal, average— Mankind is an abstraction: the
goal of breeding, even in the case of a single individual, can only
be the stronger man (— the man without breeding is weak, ex­
travagant* unstable— ).

6* Further Considerations for a
Critique of M orality
399 ( 1885-1886)
These are the demands I make upon you— however ill they
may sound to you: that you should undertake a critique of the
moral evaluations themselves* That you should call a halt to the
moral impulse, which here demands submission and not a critique,
with the question: "why submission?” That you should regard
this demand for a “wherefore?”, for a critique of morality, as
precisely your present form of morality, as the sublimest form of
morality, which does honor to you and to your age. That our
honesty, our will not to dcceive ourselves, must prove itself: why
not?— Before what tribunal? The will not to let oneself be de­
ceived is of different origin: a caution against being overpowered,
exploited— one of life’s instincts of self-defense.110

The three assertions:
The ignoble is the higher (protest of the “common man” );
the antinatural is the higher (protest of the underprivileged);
the average is the higher (protest of the herd, of the “medi­
ocre”).
Thus in the history of morality a will to power finds expres­
sion, through which now the slaves and oppressed, now the illconstituted and those who suffer from themselves, now the mediocre
attempt to make those value judgments prevail that are favorable
to them.
To this extent, the phenomenon of morality is, from a bio­
logical standpoint, highly suspicious. Morality has developed
hitherto at the expense of: the rulers and their specific instincts, the
well-constituted and beautiful natures, those who are in any sense
independent and privileged.
Morality is therefore an opposition movement against the
efforts of nature to achieve a higher type. Its effect is: mistrust of
life in general (in so far as its tendencies are considered “im­
moral” ) — hostility toward the senses (in so far as the supreme
values are considered to be opposed to the supreme instincts)—
degeneration and self-destruction of “higher natures,” because it
is precisely in them that the conflict becomes conscious.

The Values That Have Been on Top Hitherto
Morality as the supreme value, in all phases of philosophy
(even among the skeptics). Result: this world is good for nothing,
there must be a “real world.”
What really determines the supreme value here? What is
morality really? The instinct of decadence; it is the exhausted
and disinherited who in this way take their revenge and play
the master—
Historical proof: the philosophers always decadents, always
in the service of the nihilistic religions.

social value judgments, in our arts, in our science.

The declining instincts have become master over the ascending
instincts— The will to nothingness has become master over the
will to life!
—Is this true? is there perhaps not a stronger guarantee of
life in this victory of the weak and mediocre?—is it perhaps only
a means in the total movement of life, a slackening of tempo? a
self-defense against something even worse?
—Suppose the strong had become master in everything, and
even in moral valuation: let us draw the consequences of how
they would think about sickness, suffering, sacrifice! Self-con­
tempt on the part of the weak would be the result; they would
try to disappear and extinguish themselves. And would this be
desirable?— and would we really want a world in which the in­
fluence of the weak, their subtlety, consideration, spirituality,
pliancy was lacking?—
*

We have seen two “wills to power” in conflict (in this special
case: we had a principle, that of considering right those who
hitherto succumbed, and wrong those who hitherto prevailed):
we have recognized the “real world” as a “false world” and

morality as a form of immorality. We do not say: “The stronger
is wrong.”
We have grasped what it was that determined supreme value
and why it became master over the opposing valuation— : it was
stronger numerically.
Now let us purify the opposite valuation of the infection and
half-measures of the degeneration characteristic of the form in
which it is known to us.

is sufficiently elevated no longer to require the disciplinary school

To what an extent the self-destruction of morality is still a
part of its own force. We Europeans have in us the blood of those
who died for their faith; we have taken morality to be serious
and awesome, and there is nothing that we have not in some way
sacrificed to it. On the other hand: our spiritual subtlety has es­
sentially been attained through conscience-vivisection. We do not
yet know the “wither” toward which we are driven once we have
detached ourselves from our old soil But it was from this same
soil that we acquired the force which now drives us forth into the
distance, into adventures, thrusting us into the boundless, the un­
tried, the undiscovered— we have no choice left, we have to be
conquerors once we no longer have any country in which we are
at home, in which we would want to “preserve” things. A con­
cealed Yes drives us that is stronger than all our No’s. Our
strength itself will no longer endure us in the old decaying soil:
we venture away, we venture ourselves: the world is still rich and
undiscovered, and even to perish is better than to become half­
hearted and poisonous. Our strength itself drives us to sea, where
all suns have hitherto gone down: we know of a new world—

III. CRITIQUE OF PHILOSOPHY
1. General Observations
406 ( 1885-1886)
Let us get rid of a few superstitions about philosophers that
have been common so far!
407 (1884)
Philosophers are prejudiced against appearance, change, pain,
death, the corporeal, the senses, fate and bondage, the aimless.
They believe first in: absolute knowledge, (2) in knowledge
for the sake of knowledge, (3) in an association between virtue
and happiness, (4) in the comprehensibility of human actions.
[They are]118 led by instinctive moral definitions in which former
cultural conditions are reflected (more dangerous ones).
408 (1884)
What do philosophers lack? (a )118 an historical sense, (b)
knowledge of physiology, (c) a goal in the future— The ability
to formulate a critique without any irony or moral condemnation.
409 (1885)
Philosophers (1) have had from the first a wonderful capacity
for the contradictio in adjecto; (2) they have trusted in concepts
as completely as they have mistrusted the senses: they have not
stopped to consider that concepts and words are our inheritance
from ages in which thinking was very modest and unclear.
What dawns on philosophers last of all: they must no longer
accept concepts as a gift, nor merely purify and polish them, but
first make and create them, present them and make them con­
vincing. Hitherto one has generally trusted one’s concepts as if

this note.

they were a wonderful dowry from some sort of wonderland; but
they are, after all, the inheritance from our most remote, most
foolish as well as most intelligent ancestors. This piety toward what
we find in us is perhaps part of the moral element in knowledge.
What is needed above all is an absolute skepticism toward all
inherited concepts (of the kind that one philosopher perhaps
possessed— Plato, of course—for he taught the reverse).
410 ( 1885-1886)
For the Preface120
Deeply mistrustful of the dogmas of epistemology, I loved to
look now out of this window, now out of that; I guarded against
settling down with any of these dogmas, considered them harmful
— and finally: is it likely that a tool is able to criticize its own
fitness?— What I noticed was rather that no epistemological
skepticism or dogmatism had ever arisen free from ulterior motives
— that it acquires a value of the second rank as soon as one has
considered what it was that compelled the adoption of this point
of view.
Fundamental insight: Kant as well as Hegel and Schopen­
hauer— the skeptical-epochistic attitude as well as the historicizing,
as well as the pessimistic—have a moral origin. I saw no one who
had ventured a critique of moral value feelings: and I soon turned
my back on the meagre attempts made to arrive at a description of
the origin of these feelings (as by the English and German
Darwinists).
How can Spinoza’s position, his denial and rejection of moral
value judgments, be explained? (It was one consequence of his
theodicy!)
411 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. 1888)
Morality as supreme devaluation.— Either our world is the
work and expression (modus) of God: in which case it must be
supremely perfect (Leibniz’s conclusion)— and one never doubted
that one knew what constituted perfection— in which case evil
must be only apparent (Spinoza is more radical, applying this to
’"This heading has been deleted in all previous editions. This section
is discussed in my Nietzsche, Chapter 2, section II.

222

the concepts good and evil), or must proceed from God’s supreme
purpose (—perhaps as consequence of a particular mark of favor
by God, who allows a choice between good and evil: the privilege
of not being an automaton; “freedom” at the risk of making a
mistake, of choosing wrongly— e.g., see Simplicius in his com­
mentary on Epictetus).
Or our world is imperfect, evil and guilt are actual and
determined and absolutely inherent in its nature; in which case
it cannot be the real world: in which case knowledge is only the
way to a denial of it, for the world is an error which can be known
to be an error. This is the opinion of Schopenhauer on the basis of
Kantian presuppositions. Pascal is even more desperate: he com­
prehended that, in that case, even knowledge must be corrupt and
falsified—that revelation was needed even to understand that the
world ought to be denied.
412 (1883-1888)
Because we are used to unconditional authorities we have
come to need unconditional authorities:— this need is so strong
that, even in a critical age such as Kant’s, it showed itself superior
to the need for criticism and was, in a certain sense, able to subject
the entire work of critical reason and put it to its own uses.— It
proved its superiority once again in the following generation, which
was necessarily drawn by its historical instinct toward a relativity
of all authority, by pressing into its service even the Hegelian
philosophy of evolution, history re-baptized philosophy, and pre­
senting history as the progressive self-revelation, self-surpassing
of moral ideas. Since Plato, philosophy has been dominated by
morality. Even in his predecessors, moral interpretations play a
decisive role (with Anaximander, the perishing of all things as
punishment for their emancipation from pure being; with Hera­
clitus, the regularity of phenomena as witness to the moral-legal
character of the whole world of becoming).
413 (1885)
Ulterior moral motives have hitherto most obstructed the
course of philosophy.

book t w o :

Critique of Highest Values

223

414 (Jan.-Fall 1888)121
In all ages, one has taken “beautiful feelings” for arguments,
the “heaving bosom” for the bellows of divinity, convictions for
a “criterion of truth,” the need of an opponent for a question
mark against wisdom: this falsehood, this counterfeiting, per­
meates the whole history of philosophy. The skeptics— respectable
but rare— excepted, an instinct for intellectual integrity is nowhere
evident. At last even Kant tried in all innocence to make this
thinkers’ corruption scientific by means of the concept “practical
reason” : he invented a reason expressly for those cases in which
one would not need to bother about reason: namely, when the
needs of the heart, when morality, when “duty” speaks.
415 (1885-1886)
Hegel: his popular side the doctrine of war and great men.
Right is with the victorious: they represent the progress of man­
kind. Attempt to prove the dominion of morality by means of
history.
Kant: a realm of moral values, withdrawn from us, invisible,
real.
Hegel: a demonstrable development, a becoming-visible of
the moral realm.
Let us not be deceived either in the Kantian or in the Hegelian
manner:— we no longer believe in morality, as they did, and consequendy we have no need to found a philosophy with the aim
of justifying morality. Neither the critical nor the historicist phil­
osophy has any charm for us in this respect:— so what charm has it,
then?—
416 (1885-1886)
The significance of German philosophy (Hegel); to evolve
a pantheism through which evil, error, and suffering are not felt
as arguments against divinity. This grandiose project has been
misused by the existing powers (state, etc.), as if it sanctioned the
rationality of whoever happened to be ruling.

Schopenhauer, on the other hand, appears as a stubborn
morality-man who, in order to justify his moral valuation, finally
becomes a world-denier. Finally a “mystic.”
I myself have attempted an aesthetic justification: how is
the ugliness of the world possible?— I took the will to beauty,
to persist in like forms, for a temporary means of preservation
and recuperation: fundamentally, however, the eternally-creative
appeared to me to be, as the eternal compulsion to destroy,
associated with pain. The ugly is the form things assume when we
view them with the will to implant a meaning, a new meaning,
into what has become meaningless: the accumulated force which
compels the creator to consider all that has been created hitherto
as unacceptable, ill-constituted, worthy of being denied, ugly!—

M y first solution: Dionysian wisdom. Joy in the destruction
of the most noble and at the sight of its progressive ruin: in reality
joy in what is coming and lies in the future, which triumphs over

m artyr).

tegration—where I found new sources of strength for individuals.
We have to be destroyers!------ I perceived that the state of dis­
integration, in which individual natures can perfect themselves as
never before— is an image and isolated example of existence in
general. To the paralyzing sense of general disintegration and in­
completeness I opposed the eternal recurrence.
418 ( 1883-1888)
One seeks a picture of the world in that philosophy in which

book t w o :

we feel freest; i.e., in which our most powerful drive feels free
to function. This will also be the case with me!
419 (1885)
German philosophy as a whole— Leibniz, Kant, Hegel, Scho­
penhauer, to name the greatest— is the most fundamental form
of romanticism and homesickness there has ever been: the longing
for the best that ever existed. One is no longer at home anywhere;
at last one longs back for that place in which alone one can be
at home, because it is the only place in which one would want to
be at home: the Greek world! But it is in precisely that direc­
tion that all bridges are broken^—except the rainbow-bridges
of concepts! And these lead everywhere, into all the homes and
“fatherlands” that existed for Greek souls! To be sure, one
must be very subtle, very light, very thin to step across these
bridges! But what happiness there is already in this will to spirit­
uality, to ghostliness almost! How far it takes one from “pressure
and stress,” from the mechanistic awkwardness of the natural
sciences* from the market hubbub of “modern ideas”! One wants
to go back, through the Church Fathers to the Greeks, from the
north to the south, from the formulas to the Forms; one still
relishes the exit from antiquity, Christianity, as an entrance to
it, as in itself a goodly piece of the old world, as a glittering mosaic
of ancient concepts and ancient value judgments. Arabesques,
flourishes, rococo of scholastic abstractions— still better* that is
to say subtler and thinner, than the peasant and mob reality of
the European north, still a protest of higher spirituality against
the peasants’ war and mob rebellion that has become master of
spiritual taste in northern Europe and has found its leader in
the great “unspiritual man,” Luther: in this respect, German
philosophy is a piece of counter-Reformation, even of Renaissance,
at least will to Renaissance, will to go on with the discovery of
antiquity, the digging up of ancient philosophy, above all of the
pre-Socratics— the most deeply buried of all Greek temples! A
few centuries hence, perhaps, one will judge that all German
philosophy derives its real dignity from being a gradual reclamation
of the soil of antiquity, and that all claims to “originality” must
sound petty and ludicrous in relation to that higher claim of the
Germans to have joined anew the bond that seemed to be broken,
the bond with the Greeks, the hitherto highest type of man. Today

we are again getting close to all those fundamental forms of
world interpretation devised by the Greek spirit through Anaxi­
mander, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Empedocles, Democritus, and
Anaxagoras— we are growing more Greek by the day; at first, as
is only fair, in concepts and evaluations, as Hellenizing ghosts,
as it were: but one day, let us hope, also in our bodies! Herein lies
(and has always Iain) my hope for the German character!
420 (1884)
I do not wish to persuade anyone to philosophy: it is inevit­
able, it is perhaps also desirable, that the philosopher should be a
rare plant I find nothing more repugnant than didactic praise of
philosophy, as one finds it in Seneca, or worse, Cicero. Philosophy
has little to do with virtue. Permit me to say that the scholar and
scientist,122 too, are fundamentally different from the philoso­
pher,— What I desire is that the genuine concept of the philosopher
should not utterly perish in Germany. There are so many half­
hearted creatures of all kinds in Germany who would be glad to
conceal their ill-constitutedness beneath so noble a name.
421 (1884)
I have to set up the most difficult ideal of the philosopher.
Learning is not enough! The scholar is the herd animal in the realm
of knowledge— who inquires because he is ordered to and because
others have done so before him.—
422 (1885)
Superstition about philosophers: confusion with scholars and
scientists. As if values were inherent in things and all one had to
do was grasp them! To what extent they study under the direc­
tion123 of given values (their hatred of appearance, the body, etc.).
Schopenhauer concerning morality (mockery of utilitarianism). At
last, confusion goes so far that one regards Darwinism as phil­
osophy: and now the scholars and scientists dominate. Even French­
men like Taine inquire, or think they inquire, without being already
in possession of a standard of values. Prostration before “facts,”

a kind of cult. In reality, they destroy the existing evaluations.
Explanation of this misunderstanding. The man who can
command rarely appears: he misinterprets himself. One positively
wants to repudiate one’s own authority and assign it to circum­
stances.— In Germany, the esteem of the critic belongs to
the history of awakening manhood. Lessing, etc* (Napoleon on
Goethe). As a matter of fact, this movement was again reversed
by German romanticism; and the fame of German philosophy
depends on that, as if the danger of skepticism had thus been
removed and faith could be proved. Both tendencies culminate
in Hegel: at bottom, he generalized German criticism and German
romanticism— a kind of dialectical fatalism, but in honor of the
spirit, in fact with the submission of the philosopher to reality.
The critic prepares the way: no more!
With Schopenhauer the task of the philosopher dawns: the
determination of value; still under the domination of eudaemonism.

under the spell of their instincts, gone fatalistically for something
that was “truth” for them— for them and only for them. The con­
flict between different systems, including that between epistemological scruples, is a conflict between quite definite instincts (forms
of vitality, decline, classes, races, etc.).
The so-called drive for knowledge can be traced back to a
drive to appropriate and conquer: the senses, the memory, the
instincts, etc. have developed as a consequence of this drive. The
quickest possible reduction of the phenomena, economy, the
accumulation of the spoils of knowledge (i.e., of world appro­
priated and made manageable)—
Morality is such a curious science because it is in the highest
degree practical: so that the position of pure knowledge, scientific
integrity, is at once abandoned as soon as the claims of morality

must be answered. Morality says: I need many answers— reasons,
arguments; scruples can come afterward, or not at all— .
“How should one act?”— If one considers that one is dealing
with a sovereignly developed type that has “acted” for countless
millennia, and in which everything has become instinct, expediency,
automatism, fatality, then the urgency of this moral question must
actually seem ridiculous.
“How should one act?”— Morality has always been a mis­
understanding: in reality, a species fated to act in this or that
fashion wanted to justify itself, by dictating its norm as the
universal norm—
“How should one act?” is not a cause but an effect. Morality
follows, the ideal comes at the end.
— On the other hand, the appearance of moral scruples (in
other words: the becoming-conscious of the values by which one
acts) betrays a certain sickliness; strong ages and peoples do not
reflect on their rights, on the principles on which they act, on their
instincts and reasons. Becoming-conscious is a sign that real
morality, i.e., instinctive certainty in actions, is going to the devil—
Every time a new world of consciousness is created, the moralists
are a sign of damage, impoverishment, disorganization.— The
deeply instinctive are shy of Iogicizing duties: among them are
found Pyrrbohic opponents of dialectics and of knowability in
general— A virtue is refuted with a “for”—
Thesis: the appearance of moralists belongs to an age in which
morality is coming to an end.
Thesis: the moralist disintegrates the moral instincts, however
much he may suppose himself to be their restorer.
Thesis: that which really drives the moralist is not the moral
instincts but the instincts of decadence translated into the formulas
of morality— (he regards it as corruption when the instincts
become uncertain).
Thesis: the instincts of decadence, which, through the mora­
lists, want to become master over the instinctive morality of strong
races and ages, are
1. the instincts of the weak and underprivileged;
2. the instincts of the exceptions, the solitaries, the abandoned,
of the abortus125 in what is lofty and what is petty.
3. the instincts of those habituated to suffering, who need

The tartuffery of scientific manners.129------ One must not
affect scientific manners where the time has not yet come to be
scientific; but even the genuine investigator has to abandon the
vanity of affecting a kind of method for which fundamentally
the time has not yet come. Just as he must not “falsify” things
and thoughts at which he has arrived in another way by imposing
on them a false arrangement of deduction and dialectic. Thus
Kant falsified in his “morality” his inner psychological tendency;
a more recent example is Herbert Spencer’s ethics.—
One should not conceal and corrupt the facts of how our
thoughts have come to us. The profoundest and least exhausted
books will probably always have something of the aphoristic and
unexpected character of Pascal’s Pensees. The driving forces and
evaluations have long lain below the surface; what comes out is
effect.
I light all the tartuffery of false scientific manners:
1. in the demonstration, if it does not correspond to the
genesis of thoughts;
2. in the claims to methods that are perhaps not yet possible
at a certain stage of science;
3. in the claims to objectivity, to cold impersonality, where,
as in the case of all valuations, we describe ourselves and our
inner experiences in a couple of words. There are ludicrous forms
of vanity, e.g., that of Saint-Beuve, who worried all his life that
he had now and then exhibited real warmth and passion either
“for” or “against,” and would gladly have lied that fact out of
his life.

accompany them.— Here I include what might be ceiled corruption
of the character; this perspective is beside the point: I use my
character, but try neither to understand nor to change it— the per­
sonal calculus of virtue has not entered my head for a moment.
It seems to me that one shuts the door on knowledge as soon as
one becomes interested in one’s own case— or, worse, the “salv­
ation of one’s so u r!— One must not take one’s morality too seri­
ously and not let oneself be deprived of a modest right to its
opposite—
A sort of inherited wealth of morality is perhaps presupposed
here: one senses that one can squander a lot of it and throw it
out the window without really impoverishing oneself. Never to
feel tempted to admire “beautiful souls”; always to know oneself
their superior. To encounter the monsters of virtue with an inward
mockery; deniaiser la vertu127— a secret pleasure.
To revolve about oneself; no desire to become “better” or in
any way “other.” Too interested not to throw the tentacles or
nets of every morality out to things— .

take it for a sign of degeneration when an instrument tries “to

possess all the naivete and precision of an instrument— con­
sequently, we must not analyze ourselves, “know” ourselves. First
mark of the self-preservative instinct of the great psychologist:
he never seeks himself, he has no eyes for himself, no interest or
curiosity in himself128— The great egoism of our dominating will
requires that we shut our eyes to ourselves— that we must seem
to be “impersonal,” “desinteresse” “objective”!— oh, how much
we are the opposite of this! Just because we are to an eccentric

“salvation of the soul,” in our own happiness, in our own virtue.—
We have neither the time nor the curiosity to rotate about ourselves
in that way. Considered more deeply, the case is different yet:
we mistrust from the heart all navel gazing, because to us selfobservation counts as a form of degeneration of the psychological
genius, as a question mark against the instinct of the psychologist:
just as surely as a painter’s eye is degenerate if it is governed by
the will to see for the sake of seeing.

2. Critique of Greek Philosophy
427 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
The appearance of the Greek philosophers from Socrates
onwards is a symptom of decadence; the anti-Hellenic instincts
come to the top-----The “Sophist” is still completely Hellenic— including Anaxa­
goras, Democritus, the great Ionians— but as a transitional form.
The polis loses its faith in the uniqueness of its culture, in its right
to rule over every other polis— One exchanges cultures, i.e., “the
gods”— one thereby loses faith in the sole prerogative of the deus
autochthonus. Good and evil of differing origin are mingled:
the boundary between good and evil is blurred— This is the
“Sophist”—
The “philosopher,” on the other hand, is the reaction: he
desires the old virtue. He sees the grounds of decay129 in the decay
of institutions, he desires old institutions;— he sees the decay in
the decay of authority: he seeks new authorities (travels abroad,
into foreign literatures, into exotic religions— ) ; he desires the
ideal polis after the concept “polis” has had its day (approximately
as the Jews held firm as a “people” after they had fallen into
slavery). They are interested in all tyrants: they want to restore
virtue by force majeure.
Gradually everything genuinely Hellenic is made responsible
for the state of decay (and Plato is just as ungrateful to Pericles,
Homer, tragedy, rhetoric* as the prophets were to David and
Saul). The decline of Greece is understood as an objection to the
,M“Of decay” : uncertain reading; MS illegible.

foundations of Hellenic culture: basic error of philosophers— .
Conclusion: the Greek world perishes. Cause: Homer, myth, the
ancient morality, etc.
The anti-Hellenic development of the philosophers’ value
judgment:— the Egyptian (“life after death” as a court of law— ) ;
the Semitic (the “dignity of the sage,” the “sheik” ) ;— the Pythago­
reans, the subterranean cults, silence, terrorization with a beyond,
mathematics; the religious valuation, a kind of traffic with the
cosmos;—the priestly, ascetic, transcendental;— dialectic— surely
a repellent and pedantic concept splitting already in Plato?—
Decline of good taste in spiritual matters: one is already insensitive
to the ugliness and noisiness of all direct dialectics.
Two decadence movements and extremes run side by side:
(a) sensual, charmingly wicked decadence, loving art and show,
and (b) gloomy religio-moral pathos, Stoic self-hardening, Platonic
slander of the senses, preparation of the soil for Christianity.
428 (March-June 1888)
How far psychologists have been corrupted by the moral
idiosyncrasy:— not one of the ancient philosophers had the courage
for a theory of the “unfree will” (i.e., for a theory that denies
morality);— no one had the courage to define the typical element
in pleasure, every sort of pleasure (“happiness” ) as the feeling of
power: for to take pleasure in power was considered immoral;
— no one had the courage to conceive virtue as a consequence of
immorality (of a will to power) in the service of the species (or
of the race or polis), for the will to power was considered
immorality.
In the entire evolution of morality, truth never appears: all
the conceptual elements employed are fictions; all the psychologica
accepted are falsifications; all the forms of logic dragged into this
realm of lies are sophistries. What distinguishes moral philosophers
themselves is a complete absence of cleanliness and intellectual
self-discipline: they take “beautiful feelings” for arguments: they
regard their “heaving bosom” as the bellows of divinity— Moral
philosophy is the scabrous period in the history of the spirit.1"’

patronage or morality, an unheard-of wrong was perpetrated, in

fact a piece of decadence in every respect. One cannot insist too
strongly upon the fact that the great Greek philosophers represent
the decadence of every kind of Greek excellence and make
it contagious— “Virtue” made completely abstract was the greatest
seduction to make oneself abstract: i. e., to detach oneself.
It is a very remarkable moment: the Sophists verge upon the
first critique of morality, the first insight into morality:— they
juxtapose the multiplicity (the geographical relativity) of the
moral value judgments;— they let it be known that every morality
can be dialetically justified; i.e., they divine that all attempts to
give reasons for morality are necessarily sophistical— a proposition
later proved on the grand scale by the ancient philosophers, from
Plato onwards (down to K ant);— they postulate the first truth
that a “morality-in-itself,” a “good-in-itself” do not exist, that it is
a swindle to talk of “truth” in this field.
Where was intellectual integrity in those days?
The Greek culture of the Sophists had developed out of all
the Greek instincts; it belongs to the culture of the Periclean age
as necessarily as Plato does nof. it has its predecessors in Heraclitus,
in Democritus, in the scientific types of the old philosophy; it
finds expression in, e.g., the high culture of Thucydides. And—
it has ultimately shown itself to be right: every advance in epistemological and moral knowlege has reinstated the Sophists— Our
contemporary way of thinking is to a great extent Hefaclitean,
Democritean, and Protagorean: it suffices to say it is Protagorean,
because Protagoras represented a synthesis of Heraclitus and
Democritus.
(Plato: a great Cagliostro— remember how Epicurus judged
him;131 how Timon, the friend of Pyrrho, judged him------ Is Plato’s
integrity beyond question?— But we know at least that he wanted
to have taught as absolute truth what he himself did not regard as
even conditionally true: namely, the separate existence and separate
immortality of “souls.” )
429 (March-June 1888)
The Sophists are no more than realists: they formulate the
values and practices common to everyone on the level of values—

they possess the courage of all strong spirits to know their own
immorality-—
Do you suppose perchance that these little Greek free cities,
which from rage and envy would have liked to devour each other,
were guided by philanthropic and righteous principles? Does one
reproach Thucydides for the words he put into the mouths of the
Athenian ambassadors when they negotiated with the Melians
on the question of destruction or submission?
Only complete Tartuffes could possibly have talked of virtue
in the midst of this terrible tension-—or men living apart, hermits,
refugees, and emigrants from reality— people who negated in
order to be able to live themselves—
The Sophists were Greeks: when Socrates and Plato took up
the cause of virtue and justice, they were Jews or I know not
what— Grate’s tactics in defense of the Sophists are false: he
wants to raise them to the rank of men of honor and ensigns of
morality— but it was their honor not to indulge in any swindle with
big words and virtues—
430 (March-June 1888)
The great rationality of all education in morality has always
been that one tried to attain to the certainty of an instinct: so
that neither good intentions nor good means had to enter con­
sciousness as such. As the soldier exercises, so should man learn
to act. In fact, this unconsciousness belongs to any kind of per­
fection: even the mathematician employs his combinations un­
consciously—
What, then, is the significance of the reaction of Socrates, who
recommended dialectics as the road to virtue and made mock when
morality did not know how to justify itself logically?— As if this
were not part of its value—without unconsciousness it is no good—
Positing proofs as the presupposition for personal excellence
in virtue signified nothing less than the disintegration of Greek
instincts. They are themselves types of disintegration, all these
great “virtuous men” and word-spinners.
In praxi, this means that moral judgments are torn from
their conditionality, in which they have grown and alone possess
any meaning, from their Greek and Greek-political ground and
soil, to be denaturalized under the pretense of sublimation. The
great concepts "good” and “just” are severed from the presup­

book t w o :

235

positions to which they belong and, as liberated “ideas,” become
objects of dialectic. One looks for truth in them, one takes them
for entities or signs of entities: one invents a world where they
are at home, where they originate—
In summa: the mischief has already reached its climax in
Plato— And then one had need to invent the abstractly perfect
man as well:— good, just, wise, a dialectician—in short, the scare­
crow of the ancient philosopher: a plant removed from all soil;
a humanity without any particular regulating instincts; a virtue that
“proves” itself with reasons* The perfectly absurd “individuum” in
itself! unnaturalness of the first water—
In short, the consequence of the denaturalization of moral
values was the creation of a degenerate type of man— ‘the good
m an /’ “the happy man,” “the wise man.’ — Socrates represents
a moment of the profoundest perversity in the history of values.
431 (1885-1886 and 1888)
Socrates,132— This reversal of taste in favor of dialectics is
a great question mark. What was it that really happened?—
Socrates, the roturier1™ who accomplished it, achieved by means
of it victory over a more noble taste, the taste of the nobility:—
the mob achieved victory with dialectics* Before Socrates, the
dialectical manner was repudiated in good society; one believed
it compromised one; youth was warned against it. Why this display
of reasons? Why should one demonstrate? Against others one
possessed authority. One commanded: that sufficed. Among one’s
own, inter pares, one possessed tradition, also an authority: and,
finally, one ‘‘understood one another”! One simply had no place
for dialectic. Besides, one mistrusted such public presentation of
one’s arguments. Honest things do not display their reasons in
that way. There is something indecent about showing all one’s
card?. What can be “demonstrated” is of little worth.—
The instinct of all party orators knows, moreover, that dia­
lectics inspire mistrust, that they are very unconvincing. Nothing is
easier to expunge than the effect of a dialectician. Dialectics can

only be an emergency measure. One must experience an emerg­
ency, one must be obliged to extort one’s rights: otherwise one
makes no use of dialectics. That is why the Jews were dialecticians,
why Reynard the Fox was one, why Socrates was one. One has
a merciless weapon in one’s hand. One can tyrannize with it.
One compromises when one conquers. One leaves it to one’s
victim to prove that he is not an idiot. One makes others furious
and helpless, while one remains the embodiment of cool, trium­
phant reasonableness oneself— one deprives one’s opponent’s in­
telligence of potency .—
The irony of the dialectician is a form of mob revenge: the
ferocity of the oppressed finds an outlet in the cold knife-thrust
of the syllogism—
In Plato, as a man of overexcitable sensuality and enthusiasm,
the charm of the concept had grown so strong that he involuntarily
honored and deified the concept as an ideal Form. Intoxication by
dialectic: as the consciousness of exercising mastery over oneself by
means of it------ as a tool of the will to power.

nothing but the highest form of shrewdness: he calls it “virtue”
(— he divined it to be deliverance: he was not shrewd from choice,
it was de rigueurrM)', to have oneself under control, so as to go
into battle with reasons and not with affects (— the cunning of
Spinoza— the unravelling of the errors caused by affects);—to
discover that one can capture anyone in whom one produces affects,
to discover that affects proceed illogically; practice in self-mockery,
so as to damage the feeling of rancor at its roots.
I try to understand from what partial and idiosyncratic states
the Socratic problem derives: his equalization of reason = virtue =
happiness. It was with this absurdity of a doctrine of identity that
he fascinated; the philosophers of antiquity never again freed them­
selves from this fascination—
Absolute lack of objective interest: hatred for science; the
idiosyncrasy of feeling oneself as a problem. Socrates’ acoustic
hallucination: morbid element. When the spirit is rich and inde­
pendent it most resists any preoccupation with morality. How
came it that Socrates was a monomaniac in regard to morality?—
In emergencies, “practical” philosophy steps at once to the fore.
Morality and religion as chief interests are signs of an emergency.

— Shrewdness, clarity, severity and logicality as weapons
against the ferocity of the drives. These must be dangerous and
threaten destruction: otherwise there would be no sense in develop­
ing shrewdness to the point of making it into a tyrant. To make a
tyrant of shrewdness:— but for that the drives must be tyrants.
This is the problem.— In those days it was a very timely problem.
Reason became — virtue = happiness.
Solution: The Greek philosophers rest on the same funda­
mental facts of inner experience as Socrates: five steps from ex­
cess, from anarchy, from intemperance— all men of decadence.
They need him as a physician: logic as will to power, to selfmastery, to “happiness.” The ferocity and anarchy of the instincts
in the case of Socrates is a symptom of decadence. The super­

“happiness” (i.e., with “salvation of the soul,” i.e., to feel one’s
condition as a danger). The fanaticism of its interest in “happi­
ness” indicates the pathological nature of the hidden cause: it was
a life-or-death interest. To be reasonable or perish was the
alternative before which they all stood. The moralism of the
Greek philosophers indicates that they felt themselves to be in
danger—
434 (March-June 1888)
Why everything resolved itself into play-acting.— The rudi­
mentary psychology that considered only the conscious motives
of men (as causes), that took “consciousness” for an attribute of
the soul* that sought a will (i.e., an intention) behind all action: it
needed, first, only to answer “Happiness” to the question: What do
men want? (one dared not say “Power” : that would have been
im m oral);— consequently there is in all the actions of men the
intention of attaining happiness. Secondly: if man does in fact
not achieve happiness* why is it? Because he blunders in respect
of the means.— What is unfailingly the means to happiness?
Answer; virtue.— Why virtue?— Because it is supremely rational
and because rationality makes it impossible to err in the choice
of means: it is as reason that virtue is the way to happiness.
Dialectic is the constant occupation of virtue, because it excludes
all clouding of the intellect and all affects.
In fact, man does not want “happiness.” Pleasure is a feeling
of power: if one excludes the affects, then one excludes the states
that give the highest feeling of power, consequently of pleasure.
The highest rationality is a cold, clear state very far from giving
that feeling of happiness that intoxication of any kind brings with
it—
The philosophers of antiquity combat everything that intoxi­
cates— that impairs the absolute coldness and neutrality of the
consciousness— They were consistent with their false presupposi­
tion: that consciousness is the exalted, the supreme state, the
precondition of perfection—whereas the opposite is true—---To the extent that it is willed, to the extent that it is conscious,
there is no perfection in action of any kind. The philosophers of
antiquity were the greatest duffers in practice because they con­
demned themselves to be duffers in theory— In praxi, everything
resolved itself into play-acting;— and whoever saw through this,

AH the more profound natures of antiquity were disgusted
with the philosophers of virtue: they were looked upon as quarrel­

Result: little people are superior to them in their way of
living, in patience, in goodness and mutual assistance:— approxi­

they are more philosophical in practice, they meet the exigencies
of life more courageously—

Toward a critique of the philosopher.-— It is a self-deception
of philosophers and moralists to imagine that they escape decadence
by opposing it. That is beyond their will; and, however little they
acknowledge it, one later discovers that they were among the most
powerful promoters of decadence.
[Let us take]141 the philosophers of Greece, e.g., Plato. He
severed the instincts from the polis, from contest* from military
efficiency, from art and beauty, from the mysteries, from belief
in tradition and ancestors— He was the seducer of the nobility:
he was himself seduced by the roturier Socrates— He negated all
the presuppositions of the “noble Greek” of the old stamp, made
dialectic an everyday practice, conspired with tyrants, pursued
politics of the future and provided the example of the most com­
plete severance of the instincts from the past. He is profound,
passionate in everything antf-Hellenic—
These great philosophers represent one after the other the
typical forms of decadence: the moral-religious idiosyncrasy, an­
archism, nihilism (adiaphora) yXA2 cynicism, obduracy, hedonism,

The question of “happiness,” of “virtue,” of “salvation of

these types of decline: their instincts lack a center of gravity, a

To what extent dialectic and faith in reason still rest on moral
prejudices. With Plato we are, as former inhabitants of an intel­
ligible world of the good, still in possession of a heritage from that
time: divine dialectic, as proceeding from the good, leads to all
things good (— therefore, as it were, “backwards”— ). Even Des­
cartes had a notion of the fact that in a fundamentally Christianmoral mode of thought, which believes in a good God as the creator
of things, only God’s veracity guarantees to us the judgments of
our senses. Apart from a religious sanction and guarantee of our
senses and rationality-—where should we derive a right to trust in
existence! That thinking is a measure of actuality— that what can­
not be thought, is not—is a rude non plus ultra of a moralistic
trustfulness (in an essential truth-principle at the bottom of things),
in itself a mad assumption, which experience contradicts every
moment. We are altogether unable to think anything at all just as
it is—

the Indian penitents. To such refined latecomers, everything lowly,
everything poor, even everything idiotic is seductive. It has a
narcotic effect: it relaxes (Pascal). On the other hand, in the
midst of the crowd and confounded with everyone else, they feel
a little warmth: these weary people need warmth—
To overcome contradiction; no contest; no will to distinction;
to deny the Greek instincts. (Pyrrho lived with his sister who was
a midwife.) To disguise wisdom so that it no longer distinguishes;
to cloak it in poverty and rags; to perform the lowliest offices: to
go to market and sell suckling pigs—
Sweetness; light; indifference; no virtues that require gestures:
to be everyone’s equal even in virtue: ultimate self-overcoming,
ultimate indifference.
Pyrrho, like Epicurus, two forms of Greek decadence: related,
in hatred for dialectics and for all theatrical virtues— these two
together were in those days called philosophy— ; deliberately hold­
ing in low esteem that which they loved; choosing common, even
despised names for it; representing a state in which one is neither
sick nor well, neither alive nor dead—
Epicurus more naive, idyllic, grateful; Pyrrho more traveled,
experienced, nihilistic— His life was a protest against the great
doctrine of identity (happiness = virtue = knowledge). One can­

not promote the right way of life through science: wisdom does
not make “wise”— The right way of life does not want happiness,
turns away from happiness—
438 (Spring 1888)
The struggle against the “old faith” as undertaken by Epicurus
was, in a strict sense, a struggle against pre-existing Christianity—
a struggle against the old world grown senile and sick, already
gloomy, 'moralized, soured by feelings of guilt.
Not the “moral corruption” of antiquity, but precisely its
moralization is the prerequisite through which alone Christianity
could become master of it. Moral fanaticism (in short: Plato)
destroyed paganism, by revaluing its values and poisoning its
innocence.—
We ought finally to understand that what was then destroyed
was higher than what became master!—
Christianity has grown out of psychological decay, could
only take root in decayed soil.
439 (March-June 1888)
Scientific manners: as training or as instinct.— In the Greek
philosophers I see a decline of the instincts: otherwise they could
not have blundered so far as to posit the conscious state as more
valuable. Intensity of consciousness stands in inverse ratio to
ease and speed of cerebral transmission. Among Greek philoso­
phers the reverse opinion about instinct prevailed: which is always
a sign of weakened instincts.
We must in fact seek perfect life where it has become least
conscious (i.e., least aware of its logic, its reasons, its means and
intentions, its utility). The return to the facts of bon sens, of the
bon homme, of the “little people” of all kinds. The stored-up in­
tegrity and shrewdness of generations which are never conscious
of their principles and are even a little afraid of principles. The
demand for a virtue that reasons is not reasonable— A philo­
sopher is compromised by such a demand.
440 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
When morality— that is to say subtlety, caution, bravery,

BOOK TWO:

243

equity—has been as it were stored up through the practice of a
whole succession of generations, then the total force of this ac­
cumulated virtue radiates even into that sphere where integrity
is most seldom found, into the spiritual spherfc. In all becoming­
conscious there is expressed a discomfiture of the organism; it has
to try something new, ndtfcmg is sufficiently adapted for it, there
is toil, tension, strain— all this constitutes becornifig-consbious—
GetiiuS resides in instinct; goodness likewise. One acts
perfectly only when one acts instinctively. Even frotti the viewpoint
of morality, all conscious thinking is merely tentative, usually the
reverse 6f morality. Scientific integrity
always ruptiared when
the thinker begins to reason: try the experiment 6f putting the
wisest men on the most delicate scales by making them talk about
morality—
It could be proved that all conscious thinking would also
ishow a far lower standard of morality than the thinking of the
same man when it is directed by his instihcts.148
“"According to 1911, p. 505, “This aph, [sic. In fact these are not
“aphorisms” but mere notes] replaces aph. 243 of the old vol. XV [the first
edition of The Will to Power, published in 1901], which represents another
formulation of the same corttfent.” Here is the other version:
“When enough subtlety, bravery, caution, and moderation have been
collected through the practice of a long chain of generations, then the instinc­
tive power of such incorporated virtue radiates even into the most spiritual
matters—and that phenomenon becomes visible which we call intellectual
integrity, This is very rare: among philosophers it is lacking.
"One can take the scientific manner or, morally speaking the intellectual
integrity of a thinker, the subtlety, bravery, caution, and moderation that
have become instinct in him and transposed even into the rtiost spiritual
matters, and place them on the most delicate scales-^by letting him talk
about morality: then the most famous philosophers show that their scientific
manner is as yet only a conscious affair, a beginning, a ‘good will/ some­
thing laborious—and as soon as their instincts begin to speak, as soon as
they moralize, it is all over with the discipline and subtlety of their con­
science.
“The scientific manner—whether mere training and external or the final
result of long discipline and moral practice: in the former case it abdicates
as soon as the instincts speak (e.g., the religious instincts or those of the
concept of duty); in the latter case it replaces these instincts and no longer
grants them admission, feeling they represent uncleanliness and seductions— M

dix in both the Grossoktav edition and the Musarion edition, as #1074.
Schlechta omits it. It is included here not only as a matter of principle
but also for three additional reasons: (1) it is interesting to see how the
editors of the various editions proceeded; (2) it is even more interesting

441 (March-June 1888)
The struggle against Socrates, Plato, all the Socratic schools,
proceeds from the profound instinct that one does not make men
better when one represents to them that virtue is demonstrable
and asks for reasons—
Ultimately, it is the measly fact that the agonal instinct in all
these born dialecticians compelled them to glorify their personal
ability as the highest quality and to represent all other good things
as conditioned by it. The anti-scientific spirit of this entire “phi­
losophy” : it is determined to fee in the right.
442 (March-June 1888)
This is extraordinary. We find from the beginning of Greek
philosophy onwards a struggle against science with the means of an
epistemology or skepticism: and with what object? Always for the
good of morality—
(Hatted for physicists and physicians.) Socrates, Aristippus,
the Megarian school, the Cynics, Epicurus, Pyrrho— a general
assault on knowledge for the good of morality—
(Hatred for dialectics also.) A problem remains: they ap­
proach the Sophists in order to get rid of science. On the other
hand, the physicists are all so completely subjected as to take up
the schema of truth,149 of real being, into the fundamentals of
their science; e.g., the atom, the four elements (juxtaposition of
beings to explain multiplicity and change— ). Contempt for ob­
jective interest is taught: return to the practical interest, the
personal utility of all knowledge—
The struggle against science is directed against (1 ) its pathos
(objectivity), (2 ) its means (i.e., against its utility), (3) its re­
sults (as childish).
It is the same struggle that is later conducted by the church
in the name of piety: the church inherited the entire arsenal of
antiquity for its struggle. Epistemology played in this the same
role as it did in the case of Kant, in the case of the Indians— One
does not want to be troubled by it: one wants one’s hands free
for one’s “course.”
What were they really defending themselves against? Against
“Truth” is an uncertain reading of an illegible word.

obligation* against legality, against the compulsion to go hand in
hand— I believe one calls this freedom—
Decadence manifesto itself in this: the instinct of solidarity
is so degenerate that solidarity is felt as tyranny: they want no
authority, no solidarity, no lining up with the rank and file to
adopt its ignobly slack pace. They hate the measured step, the
tempo of science, they hate the lack of urgency, the perserverance,
the indifference to himself of the man of science,
443 (March-June 1888)
Fundamentally, morality is hostile to science: Socrates was
so already— and for this reason, that science takes things seriously
that have nothing to do with “good” arid “evil,” consequently
makes the feeling for “good” arid “evil” seem less important; For
morality demands that the whole man and all his forces should
stand itl its service: it considers it a squandering on the part of
brie not rich enough to squander when man concerns himself
seriously with plants and stars. This is why scientific procedures
rapidly declined in Greece once Socrates had introduced into
science the disease of moralizing; the height attained in the dis­
position of a Democritus, Hippocrates, and Thucydides was not
attained a second time.
444 (March-June 1888)
Problem of the philosopher and the man of science.— In­
fluence of age; depressive habits (staying-at-home a la Kant;
overwork; insufficient nourishment of the brain; reading). More
essentially: whether a tendency toward generalities is not already
a symptom of decadence; objectivity as disintegration of the will
(— to be able to stand so distant— ) This presupposes a great
adiaphora in regard to the powerful drives: a kind of isolation,
exceptional stance, resistance in regard to the normal drives.
Type: desertion of the homeland; further and further afield;
increasing exoticism; the old imperatives become dumb------ ; cer­
tainly this continual questioning “whither?” ( “happiness” ) is a
sign of disengagement from forms of organization, of a breaking
loose.
Problem: whether the man of science is more of a symptom
of decadence than the philosophers:—he is not disengaged as a

whole, only a part of him is absolutely dedicated to knowledge,
trained to one corner and perspective—he needs all the virtues
of a strong race and health, great severity, manliness, shrewdness.
He is a symptom more of a higher multiplicity of culture than of
its weariness. The scholar of decadence is a bad scholar. While
the philosopher of decadence has counted, hitherto at least, as the
typical philosopher.
445 ( Jan.-Fall 1888)
Nothing is rarer among philosophers than intellectual integrity.
perhaps they say the opposite, perhaps they even believe it. But
a condition of their entire occupation is that only certain truths are
admitted; they know that which they have to proye; that they are
at one over these “truths” is virtually their means of recognizing
one another as philosophers. There are, e.g., moral truths. But
a faith in morals is not a proof of morality: there are cases—-and
the case of the philosopher is one-—in which such a faith is simply
a piece of immorality.
446 (March-June 1888)
What, theti, is regressive in the philosopher?-— That he teaches
that his qualities are the necessary and sole qualities for the attain­
ment of the “highest good” (e.g., dialectic, as with Plato). That
he orders men of all kinds gradatim1S0 up to his type as the highest.
That he despises what is generally esteemed— that he opens up
a gulf between priestly values and worldly values. That he knows
what is true, what God is, what the goal is, what the way is—
The typical philosopher is here an absolute dogmatist;— if
he has need of skepticism, it is so as to be able to speak dog­
matically about his main interest.
447 (March-June 1888)
The philosopher in opposition to his rivals; e.g., in opposi­
tion to science: then he becomes a skeptic; then he reserves to
himself a form of knowledge that he denies the man of science;
then he goes hand in hand with the priest so as not181 to arouse

the suspicion of atheism, materialism; he regards an attack on
himself as an attack on morality* virtue, religion, order— he knows
how to discredit his opponents as “seducers” and “underminers” :
then he goes hand in hand with power.
The philosopher in a struggle with other philosophers— he
tries to compel them to appear as anarchists, unbelievers, opponents
of authority. In summa: in so far as he struggles, he struggles just
as a priest does, just as priesthood does.

found and that ignorance and error are at an end is one of the
most potent seductions there is. Supposing it is believed, then the
will to examination^ investigation, caution, experiment is paralyzed:
it can even count as criminal, namely as doubt concerning truth—
“Truth” is therefore more fateful than error and ignorance,
because it cuts off the forces that work toward enlightenment and
knowledge.
The affect of laziness now takes the side of.“truth”— (“think­
ing is distress, misery!”); as do order, rule, happiness in possess­
ing, pride in wisdom— vanity in summa:— it is more comfortable
to obey than to examine; it is more flattering to think “I possess
the truth” than to see only darkness around one— above all: it is
reassuring, it gives confidence, it alleviates life—it “improves”
the character, to the extent that it lessens mistrust. “Peace of soul,”
“a quiet conscience” : all inventions made possible only by pre­
supposing that truth has been found.— “By their fruits shall ye
know them”— “Truth” is truth, for it makes men better— The
process goes on: everything good, all success, is placed to the
credit of “truth.”
This is the proof of strength:154 the happiness, the content­
ment, the well-being of the community, as of the individual, are
henceforth understood as the consequence of belief in morality—
The converse: ill success is attributed to lack of faith— .
453 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
The causes of error lie just as much in the good will [as in
the ill will156] of man— : in a thousand cases he conceals reality
from himself, he falsifies it, so as not to suffer from his good [or
ill j is® win E.g., God as the director of human destiny: or the
interpretation of his own petty destiny as if everything were con­
trived and sent with a view to the salvation of his soul— this lack
of “philology,” which to a more subtle intellect would have to
count as uncleanliness and counterfeiting, is, on the average, per­
formed under the inspiration of good will. Good will, “noble
feelings,” “lofty states” are in the means they employ just as much

counterfeiters and deceivers as the affects repudiated by morality
and called egoistic: love, hate, revenge.
Errors are what mankind has had to pay for most dearly:
and, on the whole, it is the errors of “good will” which have harmed
it most profoundly. The illusion that makes happy is more per­
nicious than that which has immediate bad consequences: the
latter sharpens and purifies157 reason and makes it more mistrustful
— the former lulls it to sleep.—
Beautiful feelings, sublime agitations, are, physiologically
speaking, among the narcotics: their misuse has precisely the
same consequences as the misuse of any other opiate— neuras­
thenia—
454 (1888)
Error is the most expensive luxury that man can permit him­
self; and if the error happens to be a physiological error, then it
is perilous to life. What, consequently, has man hitherto paid
for most dearly? For his “truths” : for they have all been errors
in physiologicis—
455 (Jart.-Fall 1888)
Psychological confusions:— the demand for belief— confused
with the “will to truth” (e.g., in the case of Carlyle).158 But in
the same way, the demand for unbelief has been confused with
the “will to truth” (— the need to get free from a belief, for a
hundred reasons: to be in the right against some “believers” ).
What inspires the skeptic? Hatred of the dogmatist—o r a need
for rest, a weariness, as in the case of Pyrrho.
The advantages that one anticipated from truth were ad­
vantages resulting from belief in it:— in itself, that is, truth could
be altogether painful, harmful, fateful— . One likewise disputed
the “truth” only when one promised oneself advantages from
one’s victory— e.g., freedom from the ruling powers.
The methods of truth were not invented from motives of
truth, but from motives of power, of wanting to be superior.
How is truth proved? By the feeling of enhanced power159—

by utility—by indispensability— in short, by advantages (namely,
presuppositions concerning what truth ought to be like for us
to recognize it). But that is a prejudice: a sign that truth is not
involved at all—
What, e.g., is the meaning of the “will to truth” in the case
of the Goncourts?160 in the case of the naturalists?— Critique of
“objectivity.”
Why know: why not rather be deceived?— What one always
wanted was faith— and not truth— Faith is created by means
antithetical to the methods of research— : they even exclude the
latter— .
456 (March-June 1888)
A Certain degree of faith serves us today as an objection
to what is believed— even more as a question mark against the
spiritual health of the believer.
457 (Jan-Fatt 1888)
Martyrs.— In order to combat anything founded on rever­
ence, the attacker must be possessed of a somewhat audacious,
relentless, even shameless disposition— Now if one considers
that mankind has for millennia sanctified as truths only what was
error, that is has even branded any critique of these as a sign of
a wicked disposition, then one is bound to confess with regret
that a goodly amount of immorality was needed to provide the
initiative for aggression, in other words for reason—
These immoralists should be forgiven for always having posed
as “martyrs to truth” : the truth is that it was not the drive to
truth which made them negate, but disintegration, sacrilegious
skepticism, pleasure in adventure— . In other cases, it is personal
rancor that drives them into the domain of problems— they combat
problems in order to be in the right against particular people.
But it is revenge above all that science has been able to employ—
the revenge of the oppressed, those who had been pushed aside
and, in fact, oppressed by the prevailing truth—
Truth, that is to say, the scientific method, was grasped and
promoted by those who divined in it a weapon of war— an in180Cf. Twilight, “Skirmishes,'’ section 7 (Portable Nietzsche, p. 517).

strument of destruction— To make their opposition honorable,
they needed, moreover, an apparatus similar in kind to that used
by those they were attacking:— they adopted the concept “truth”
just as ostentatiously and unconditionally as their opponents—
they became fanatics, at least they posed as such, because no
other pose was taken seriously. What remained to be done was
accomplished by persecution, passion and the insecurity of the
persecuted— hatred grew and consequently the precondition for
remaining scientific was diminished. Ultimately, they all wanted
to be right in the same absurd fashion as their opponents— The
words “conviction,” “faith,” the pride of martyrdom— these are
the least favorable states for the advancement of knowledge. The
opponents of truth at last reaccepted the entire subjective manner
of deciding questions of truth, namely by poses, sacrifices, heroic
resolutions— and thus prolonged the dominion of antiscientific
methods. As martyrs they compromised their own deed.
458 (March-June 1888)™
Dangerous distinction between “theoretical” and “practical,”
e«g., in the case of Kant, but also in the case of the ancients:—
they act as if pure spirituality presented them with the problems
of knowledge and metaphysics;—they act as if practice must be
judged by its own measure, whatever the answer of theory may be*
Against the former I direct my psychology of philosophers:
their most alienated calculations and their “spirituality” are still
only the last pallid impression of a physiological fact; the voluntary
is absolutely lacking, everything is instinct, everything has been
directed along certain lines from the beginning—
Against the latter I ask whether we know of any other method
of acting well than always thinking well; the latter is an action, and
the former presupposes thought. Have we a different method for
judging the value of a way of life from judging the value of a
theory: by induction, by comparison?—
The naive believe that we are better equipped here, that
here we know what is “good”— philosophers repeat it. We con­
clude that a faith is here at work, nothing more—
“One must act; consequently rules of conduct are needed”—
said even the skeptics of antiquity. The urgent need for a decision
as an argument for considering something truel

“One must not act”— said their more consistent brothers, the
Buddhists, and conceived a rule of conduct to liberate one from
actions—
To accommodate oneself, to live as the “common man” lives,
to hold right and good what he holds right: this is to submit to
the herd instinct. One must take one’s courage and severity so far
as to feel such a submission as a disgrace* Not to live with two
different standards!— Not to separate theory and practice!—

459 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
That nothing formerly held true is true— What was formerly
despised as unholy, forbidden, contemptible, fateful— all these
flowers grow today along the lovely paths of truth.
This entire old morality concerns us no more: there is not
a concept in it that still deserves respect. We have outlived it—
we are no longer coarse and naive enough to have to let ourselves
be deceived in this fashion— In more polite words: we are too
virtuous for it— And if truth in the old sense was "truth” only
because the old morality affirmed it, had a right to affirm it, then
it follows that we no longer have heed of any former truths,
either— Our criterion of truth is by no means morality: we refute
an opinion by showing it to be dependent on morality, to be in­
spired by noble feelings.

460 (March-June 1888)
All these values are empirical and conditional. But he who
believes in them, who reverences them, refuses to recognize just
this characteristic of them. Philosophers believe one and all in
these values, and one form their reverence took was the attempt to
make a priori truths of them. The falsifying character of rever­
ence—
Reverence is the supreme test of integrity: but in the entire
history of philosophy there is no intellectual integrity—but only
“love of the good”—
The absolute lack of methods of testing the value of these
values; secondly: reluctance to test values, to take them as being
in any way conditional.— In the case of moral values, all the
antiscientific instincts came together with the object of excluding
science—

4. Further Considerations for a
Critique of Philosophy
461 (March-June 1888)
Why philosophers are slanderers.— The treacherous and blind
hostility of philosophers towards the senses1*2— how much of
mob and middle class there is in this hatred!
The common people always consider an abuse of which they
feel the ill consequences as an objection to that which is abused:
all insurrectionary movements aimed against principles, whether
political or economic, argue thus, with the idea of representing an
abuse as being necessary to, and inherent in, the principle.
It is a miserable story: man seeks a principle through which
he can despise men—he invents a world so as to be able to
slander and bespatter this world: in reality, he reaches every time
for nothingness and construes nothingness as “God,” as “truth,”
and in any case as judge and condemner of this state of being—
If one wants a proof of how profoundly and thoroughly the
actually barbarous needs of man seek satisfaction, even when he
is tamed and “civilized,” one should take a look at the “leitmotifs”
of the entire evolution of philosophy:— a sort of revenge on reality,
a malicious destruction of the valuations by which men live, an
unsatisfied soul that feels the tamed state as a torture and finds
a voluptuous pleasure in a morbid unraveling of all the bonds
that tie it to such a state.
The history of philosophy is a secret raging against the pre­
conditions of life, against the value feelings of life, against partisan­
ship in favor of life, Philosophers have never hesitated to affirm
a world provided it contradicted this world and furnished them
with a pretext for speaking ill of this world. It has been hitherto
the grand school of slander; and it has imposed itself to such an
extent that today our science, which proclaims itself the advocate
m At this point the German editors saw fit to dinit the following lines:
“It is not the senses that deceive. Our nose, of which, as fir as'I know,

no philosopher has ever spoken with due respect, is as yet the most delicate
scientific [physikalisch] instrument in existence: it is capable of registering
vibrations where even the spectroscope fails.”
This section, including the passage just cited, was utilized by Nietzsche
in Twilight, Chapters III and IV.

of life, has accepted the basic slanderous position and treated
this world as apparent, this chain of causes as merely phenomenal.
What is it really that hates here?
I fear it is still the Circe of philosophers, morality, that has
here bewitched them into having to be slanderers forever— They
believed in moral “truths/’ they found there the supreme values—
what else could they do but deny existence more firmly the more
they got to know it?— For this existence is immoral— And this
life depends upon immoral preconditions: and all morality denies
life— .
Let us abolish the real world: and to be able to do this we
first have to abolish the supreme value hitherto; morality—- It
suffices to demonstrate that even morality is immoral, iit the sense
in which immorality has always been condemned. If the tyranny
of former values is broken in this way, if we have abolished the
“real world,” then a new Order of values must follow of its own
accord.
The apparent world and the world invented by a lie—this is
the antithesis. The latter has hitherto been called the “real world,”
“truth,” “God.” This is what we have to abolish.
Logic of my conception:
1. Morality as supreme value (master over all phases of
philosophy, even over the skeptics). Result: this world is good
for nothing, it is not the “real world.”
2. What here determines the supreme value? What is morality,
really?— The instinct of decadence; it is the exhausted and dis­
inherited who take revenge in this fashion. Historical proof: phi­
losophers are always decadents—in the service of the nihilistic
religions.
3. The instinct of decadence which appears as will to power.
Proof: the absolute immorality of means throughout the entire
history of morality.
General insight: the highest values hitherto are a special
case of the will to power; morality itself is a special case of im­
morality.103
1WThe short last paragraph was taken by the editors from another more
detailed section. At this point the MS had merely: “In this whole movement
we have recognized merely a special case of the will to power.’* The first

creative mode of thought dominates that does not posit the happi­
ness of repose, the “Sabbath of Sabbaths” as a goal for the world,
and honors even in peace the means to new wars;188 a mode of
thought that prescribes laws for the future, that for the sake of
the future is harsh and tyrannical towards itself and all things of
the present; a reckless, “imnioral” mode of thought, which wants
to develop both the good and the bad qualities in man to their
fullest extent, because it feels it has the strength to put both in
their right place— in the place where each needs the other. But
he who thus looks for philosophers today, what prospect has he of
finding what he is looking for? Is it hot likely that, even with the
best Diogenes lantern, he Will search about ih vain all day and all
night? The age possesses the reverse instincts; it wants, first and
above all, comfort; it wants, in the second place, publicity and that
great actors’ hubbub, that great drum banging that appeals to its fun­
fair tastes; it wants, thirdly, that everyone should fall on his face
in the profoundest subjection before the greatest of all lies— it is
called “equality of men”— and honor exclusively those virtues
that level and equalize. But the rise of the philosopher, as I under­
stand him, is therewith rendered altogether impossible, notwith­
standing that it is thought in all innocence to be favorable to him.
Indeed, all the world bewails today the evil situation of the phi­
losopher in earlier times, hemmed in between the stake, bad
conscience, and the arrogant wisdom of the Church Fathers: the
truth, however, is that precisely this was a much more favorable
condition for the education of a powerful, comprehensive, cunning
and audaciously daring spirituality than the conditions of life at
present. Today, another kind of spirit, namely the spirit of the
demagogue, the spirit of the actor, perhaps also the scholarly
beaver- and ant-like spirit, finds conditions favorable. But things
are so much the worse even for superior artists: for are they not,
almost all of them, perishing from a lack of inner discipline?
They are no longer tyrannized over from without by a church’s
tables of absolute values or those of a court; thus they also no
longer learn to develop their “inner tyrants,” their will. And what
is true of artists is true in a higher and more fateful sense of

The most valuable insights are arrived at last; but the most

All the methods, all the presuppositions of our contemporary
science were for millennia regarded with the profoundest contempt;
on their account one was excluded from the society of respectable
people— one was considered as an “enemy of God,” as a reviler
of the highest ideal, as “possessed.”
1 Much of the material in this part was utilized by Nietzsche in the
first chapter of Beyond Good and Evil, published in 1886, and in Twilight
of the Idols (completed in the early fall of 1888), especially in the chapter
“The Four Great Errors” and—some of the sections on the “true” and the
“apparent’1 world—in the chapters “ ‘Reason* in Philosophy” and “How the
True World* Finally Became a Fable.” But there are also many ideas and
a great many formulations that were not included in any of the books
Nietzsche finished—presumably in most cases because Nietzsche was not
fully satisfied with his notes. What follows, then, does not represent his final
point of view; but some of his most interesting suggestions are to be found
only in these sections.

We have had the whole pathos of mankind against us— our
conception of what “truth” should be, what service of truth should
be, our objectivity, our method, our silent, cautious, mistrustful
ways were considered perfectly contemptible—
At bottom, it has been an aesthetic taste that has hindered
mankind most: it believed in the picturesque effect of truth, it
demanded of the man of knowledge that he should produce a
powerful effect on the imagination.
This looks as if an antithesis has been achieved, a leap made;
in reality, the schooling through moral hyperbole prepared the
way step by step for that milder of pathos that became incarnate
in the scientific character—
The conscientiousness in small things, the self-control of the
religious man were a preparatory school for the scientific character:
above all, the disposition that takes problems seriously, regardless
of the personal consequences—

The presupposition that things are, at bottom, ordered so
morally that human reason must be justified— is an ingenuous pre­

God’s veracity—God understood as the creator of things.— These
concepts an inheritance from a former existence in a beyond-----472 (1883- 1888)

473 ( 1886-1887)
The intellect cannot criticize itself, simply because it cannot
be compared with other species of intellect and because its capacity
to know would be revealed only in the presence of "true reality,”
i.e., because in order to criticize the intellect we should have to be
a higher being with “absolute knowledge,” This presupposes that,
distinct from every perspective kind of outlook or sensual-spiritual
appropriation, something exists, an “in-itself.”— But the psycho­
logical derivation of the belief in things forbids us to speak of
“things-in-themselves.”
474 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
That a sort of adequate relationship subsists between subject
and object, that the object is something that if seen from within
would be a subject, is a well-meant invention which, I think, has
had its day. The measure of that of which we are in any way con­
scious is totally dependent upon the coarse utility of its be­
coming-conscious: how could this nook-perspective of conscious­
ness permit us to assert anything of “subject” and “object” that
touched reality!—

I maintain the phenomenality of the inner world, too: every­
thing of which we become conscious is arranged, simplified,

264

THE WILL

TO P O W E R

schematized, interpreted through and through—the actual process
of inner “perception,” the causal connection between thoughts,
feelings, desires, between subject and object, are absolutely hidden
from us— and are perhaps purely imaginary. The “apparent inner
world” is governed by just the same forms and procedures as the
“outer” world. We never encounter “facts” : pleasure and dis­
pleasure are subsequent and derivative intellectual phenomena—
“Causality” eludes us; to suppose a direct causal link beween
thoughts, as logic does— that is the consequence of the crudest
and clumsiest observation. Between two thoughts all kinds of
affects play their game: but their motions are too fast, therefore
we fail to recognize them, we deny them—
“Thinking,” as epistemologists conceive it, simply does not
occur: it is a quite arbitrary fiction, arrived at by selecting one
element from the process and eliminating all the rest, an artificial
arrangement for the purpose of intelligibility—
The “spirit,” something that thinks: where possible even
“absolute, pure spirit”—this conception is a second derivative
of that false introspection which believes in “thinking” : first an
act is imagined which simply does not occur, “thinking,” and
secondly a subject-substratum in which every act of thinking,
and nothing else, has its origin: that is to say, both the deed and
the doer are fictions.
478 (March-June 1888)
One must not look for phenomenalism in the wrong place:
nothing is more phenomenal (or, more clearly:) nothing is so
much deception as this inner world which we observe with the
famous “inner sense.”
We have believed in the will as cause to such an extent that
we have from our personal experience introduced a cause into
events in general (i.e., intention a cause of events— ).
We believe that thoughts as they succeed one another in our
minds stand in some kind of causal relation: the logician especially,
who actually speaks of nothing but instances which never occur in
reality, has grown accustomed to the prejudice that thoughts cause
thoughts— .
We believe— and even our philosopers still believe— that
pleasure and pain are causes of reactions, that the purpose of

book th r ee:

Principles of A New Evaluation

265

pleasure and pain is to occasion reactions. For millennia, pleasure
and the avoidance of displeasure have been flatly asserted as the
motives for every action. Upon reflection, however, we should con­
cede that everything would have taken the same course, according
to exactly the same sequence of causes and effects, if these states
“pleasure and displeasure” had been absent, and that one is
simply deceiving oneself if one thinks they cause anything at all:
they are epiphenomena with a quite difffferent object than to
evoke reactions; they are themselves effects within the instituted
process of reaction.
In summa: everything of which we become conscious is a
terminal phenomenon, an end— and causes nothing; every succes­
sive phenomenon in consciousness is completely atomistic— And
we have sought to understand the world through the reverse con­
ception— as if nothing were real and effective but thinking, feeling,
willing!—
479 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
The phenomenalism of the “inner w o rld " Chronological
inversion* so that the cause enters consciousness later than the
effect.— We have learned that pain is projected to a part of the
body without being situated there— we have learned that sense
impressions naively supposed to be conditioned by the outer world
are, on the contrary, conditioned by the inner world; that we are
always unconscious of the real activity of the outer world— The
fragment of outer world of which we are conscious is bom after
an effect from outside has impressed itself upon us, and is sub­
sequently projected as its “cause”—
In the phenomenalism of the “inner world” we invert the
chronological order of cause and effect. The fundamental fact
of “inner experience” is that the cause is imagined after the effect
has taken place— The same applies to the succession of thoughts:
— we seek the reason for a thought before we are conscious of
it; and the reason enters consciousness first, and then its con­
sequence— Our entire dream life is the interpretation of complex
feelings with a view to possible causes— and in such way that we
are conscious of a condition only when the supposed causal chain
associated with it has entered consciousness.
The whole of “inner experience” rests upon the fact that a

266

THE

WILL

TO P O W E R

cause for an excitement of the nerve centers is sought and imagined
—and that only a cause thus discovered enters consciousness: this
cause in no way corresponds to the real cause— it is a groping on
the basis of previous “inner experiences,” i.e., of memory. But
memory also maintains the habit of the old interpretations, i.e., of
erroneous causality— so that the “inner experience” has to contain
within it the consequences of all previous false causal fictions.
Our “outer world” as we project it every moment is indissolubly
tied to the old error of the ground: we interpret it by means of
the schematism of “ things,” etc.
“Inner experience” enters our consciousness only after it has
found a language the individual understands— i.e., a translation of
a condition into conditions familiar to him— ; “to understand”
means merely: to be able to express something new in the language
of something: old and familiar. E.g., “I feel unwell”— such a
judgment presupposes a great and late neutrality of the observer— ;
the simple man always says: this or that makes me feel unwell
—he makes up his mind about his feeling unwell only when he has
seen a reason for feeling unwell.— I call that a lack o f p h ilo lo g y;
to be able to read off a text as a text without interposing an in­
terpretation is the last-developed form of “inner experience”—
perhaps one that is hardly possible—
480 (March-June 1888)
There exists neither “spirit,” nor reason, nor thinking, nor
consciousness, nor soul, nor will, nor truth: all are fictions that
are of no use, There is no question of “subject and object,” but
of a particular species of animal that can prosper only through a
certain relative rightness; above all, regularity of its perceptions
(so that it can accumulate experience)—
Knowledge works as a tool of power. Hence it is plain that
it increases with every increase of power—
The meaning of “knowledge” : here, as in the case of “good”
or “beautiful,” the concept is to be regarded in a strict and narrow
anthropocentric and biological sense. In order for a particular
species to maintain itself and increase its power, its conception of
reality must comprehend enough of the calculable and constant
for it to base a scheme of behavior on it. The utility of preservation
—not some abstract-theoretical need not to be deceived— stands

book t h r e e :

Principles of A New Evaluation

267

as the motive behind the development of the organs of knowledge
— they develop in such a way that their observations suffice for
our preservation. In other words: the measure of the desire for
knowledge depends upon the measure to which the will to power
grows in a species: a species grasps a certain amount of reality
in order to become master of it, in order to press it into service.

3. B elief in the “E go.” The Subject
481 (1883-1888)
Against positivism, which halts at phenomena—“There are
o n ly facts"— I would say: No, facts is precisely what there is not,
only interpretations. We cannot establish any fact “in itself’:
perhaps it is folly to want to do such a thing.
“Everything is subjective,” you say; but even this is interpre­
tation. The “subject” is not something given, it is something added
and invented and projected behind what there is.— Finally, is it
necessary to posit an interpreter behind the interpretation? Even
this is invention, hypothesis.
In so far as the word “knowledge” has any meaning, the
world is knowable; but it is interpretable otherwise, it has no mean­
ing behind it, but countless meanings.— “Perspectivism.”
It is our needs that interpret the world; our drives and their
For and Against. Every drive is a kind of lust to rule; each one
has its perspective that it would like to compel all the other drives
to accept as a norm.
482 ( 1886-1887)
We set up a word at the point at which our ignorance begins,
at which we can see no further, e.g., the word “I,” the word “do,”
the word “suffer” :—-these are perhaps the horizon of our knowl­
edge, but not "truths.”
483 (1885)
Through thought the ego is posited; but hitherto one believed
as ordinary people do, that in “I think” there was something of

268

THE

WILL

TO P O W E R

immediate certainty, and that this “I ” was the given cause of
thought, from which by analogy we understood all other causal
relationships; However habitual and indispensable this fiction may
have become by now— that in itself proves nothing against its
imaginary origin: a belief can be a condition of life and nonethe­
less be false.2
484 (Spring-Fall 1887)
“There is thinking: therefore there is something that thinks” :
this is the upshot of all Descartes’ argumentation. But that means
positing as “true a priori” our belief in the concept of substance—
that when there is thought there has to be something “that thinks”
is simply a formulation of our grammatical custom that adds a
doer to every deed. In short, this is not merely the substantiation
of a fact but a logical-metaphysical postulate— Along the lines
followed by Descartes one does not come upon something abso­
lutely certain but only upon the fact of a very strong belief.
If one reduces the proposition to “There is thinking, there­
fore there are, thoughts,” one has produced a mere tautology:
and precisely that which is in question, the “reality of thought,”
is not touched upon— that is, in this form the “apparent reality”
of thought cannot be denied. But what Descartes desired was that
thought should have, not an apparent reality, but a reality in itself.
485 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The concept of substance is a consequence of the concept of
the subject: not the reverse! If we relinquish the soul, “the sub­
ject,” the precondition for “substance” in general disappears.
One acquires degrees of being, one loses that which has being.
Critique of “reality” : where does the “more or less real,”
the gradation of being in which we believe, lead to?—
The degree to which we feel, life and power (logic and
coherence of experience) gives us our measure of “being,” “reality,”
not-appearance.
The subject: this is the term for our belief in a unity under­
lying all the different impulses of the highest feeling of reality: we
J Cf. sections 487 and 493 and Beyond, section 4. This section, not in
Nietzsche’s handwriting, was evidently dictated.

book th r e e :

Principles of A New Evaluation

269

understand this belief as the effect of one cause— we believe so
firmly in our belief that for its sake we imagine “truth,” “reality,”
“substantiality” in general.— “The subject” is the fiction that
many similar states in us are the effect of one substratum: but
it is we who first created the “similarity” of these states; our
adjusting them and making them similar is the fact, not their
similarity (— which ought rather to be denied— ).
486 (1885-1886)
One would have to know what being is, in order to decide
whether this or that is real (e.g., “the facts of consciousness” ) ; in
the same way, what certainty is, what knowledge is, and the like.—
But since we do not know this, a critique of the faculty of knowl­
edge is senseless: how should a tool be able to criticize itself when
it can use only itself for the critique? It cannot even define itself!3
487 (1883-1886)
Must all philosophy not ultimately bring to light the precondi­
tions upon which the process of reason depends?— our belief in
the “egp” as a substance, as the sole reality from which we ascribe
reality to things in general? The oldest “realism” at last comes to
light: at the same time that the entire religious history of mankind
is recognized as the history of the soul superstition. Here we come
to a limit: our thinking itself involves this belief (with its distinc­
tion of substance, accident; deed, doer, e ta ) ; to let it go means:
being no longer able to think*
But that a belief, however necessary it may be for the preserva­
tion of a species, has nothing to do with truth, one knows from
the fact that, e.g., we have to believe in time, space, and motion,
without feeling compelled to grant them absolute reality.
488 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Psychological derivation of our belief in reason.— The con­
cept “reality,” “being,” is taken from our feeling of the “subject.”
“The subject” : interpreted from within ourselves, so that
the ego counts as a substance, as the cause of all deeds, as a doer.
5Cf. section 473.

270

THE

WILL

TO P O W E R

The logical-metaphysical postulates, the belief in substance,
accident, attribute, etc., derive their convincing force from our
habit of regarding all our deeds as consequences of our will—so
that the ego, as substance, does not vanish in the multiplicity of
change.— But there is no such thing as will.—
We have no categories at all that permit us to distinguish a
“world in itself” from a “world of appearance.” All our categories
of reason are of sensual origin: derived from the empirical'world.
“The soul,” “the ego”— the history of these concepts shows that
here, too, the oldest distinction (“breath,” “life” )—
If there is nothing material, there is also nothing immaterial.
The concept no longer contains anything.
No subject “atoms.” The sphere of a subject constantly grow­
ing or decreasing, the center of the system constantly shifting;
In cases where it cannot organize the appropriate mass, it breaks
into two parts; On the other hand, it can transform a weaker sub­
ject into its functionary without destroying it, and to a certain
degree form a new unity with it. No “substance,” rather some­
thing that in itself strives after greater strength, and that wants to
“preserve” itself only indirectly (it wants to surpass itself— ).
489 (1886-1887)
Everything that enters consciousness as ‘‘unity” is already
tremendously complex: we always have only a semblance of unity.
The phenomenon of the body is the richer, clearer, more
tangible phenomenon: to be discussed first, methodologically,
without coming to any decision about its ultimate significance.
490 (1885)
The assumption of one single subject is perhaps unnecessary;
perhaps it is just as permissible to assume a multiplicity of sub­
jects, whose interaction and struggle is the basis of our thought
and our consciousness in general? A kind of aristocracy of “cells”
in which dominion resides? To be sure, an aristocracy of equals,
used to ruling jointly and understanding how to command?
M y hypotheses: The subject as multiplicity.
Pain intellectual and dependent upon the judgment “harm­
ful” : projected.

The effect always “unconscious” : the inferred and imagined
cause is projected, follows in time.
Pleasure is a kind of pain.
The only force that exists is of the same kind as that of
the will: a commanding of other subjects, which thereupon change.
The continual transitoriness and fleetingness of the subject.
“Mortal soul.”
Number as perspective form.
491 ( 1885-1886)
Belief in the body is more fundamental than belief in the soul:
the latter arose from unscientific reflection on [the agonies of]4
the body (something that leaves it. Belief in the truth of dreams— ).
492 {1885)
H ie body and physiology the starting point: why?— We gain
the correct idea of the nature of our subject-unity, namely as
regents at the head of a communality (not as “souls” or “life
forces”), also of the dependence of these regents upon the ruled
and of an order of rank and division of labor as the conditions
that make possible the whole and its parts. In the same way, how
living unities continually arise and die and how the “subject” is
not eternal; in the same way, that the struggle expresses itself in
obeying and commanding, and that a fluctuating assessment of
the limits of power is part of life. The relative ignorance in which
the regent is kept concerning individual activities and even dis­
turbances within the communality is among the conditions under
which rule can be exercised. In short, we also gain a valuation of
not-knowing, of seeing things on a broad scale, of simplification
and falsification, of perspectivity. The most important thing, how­
ever, is: that we understand that the ruler and his subjects are of
the same kind, all feeling, willing, thinking— and that, wherever
we see or divine movement in a body, we learn to conclude that
there is a subjective, invisible life appertaining to it. Movement
is symbolism for the eye; it indicates that something has been felt,
willed, thought.

editors, on the basis of one of Nietzsche’s other notes.

The danger of the direct questioning of the subject about the
subject and of all self-reflection of the spirit lies in this, that it
could be useful and important for one’s activity to interpret oneself
falsely. That is why we question the body and reject the evidence
of the sharpened Senses: we try, if you like, to see whether the
inferior parts themselves cannot enter into communication with us.

4. Biology of the Drive to Knowledge.
Perspectivism
493 (1885)
Truth is the kind of error without which a certain species of
life could not live. The value for life is ultimately decisive.6
494 (1885)
It is improbable that our “knowledge” should extend further
than is strictly necessary for the preservation of life. Morphology
shows us how the senses and the nerves, as well as the brain, de­
velop in proportion to the difficulty of finding nourishment.
495
If the morality of “thou shalt not lie” is rejected, the “sense
for truth” will have to legitimize itself before another tribunal:—
as a means of the preservation of man, as will to power.
Likewise our love of the beautiful: it also is our shaping will.
The two senses stand side-by-side; the sense for the real is the
means of acquiring the power to shape things according to our
wish. The joy in shaping and reshaping— a primeval joy! We can
comprehend only a world that we ourselves have made.
496 (1884)
Of the multifariousness of knowledge. To trace one’s own
relationship to many other things (or the relationship of kind)—
how should that be “knowledge” of other things! The way of
knowing and of knowledge is itself already part of the conditions
‘ Cf. sections 483 and 487; but also 172.

book th r e e :

273

of existence: so that the conclusion that there could be no other
kind of intellect (for us) than that which preserves us is pre­
cipitate: this actual condition of existence is perhaps only accidental
and perhaps in no way necessary.
Our apparatus for acquiring knowledge is not designed for
“knowledge.”
497 (1884)
The most strongly believed a priori “truths” are for me—pro­
visional assumptions’, e.g., the law of causality, a very well acquired
habit of belief, so much a part of us that not to believe in it
would destroy the, race. But are they for that reason truths? What
a conclusion! As if the preservation of man were a proof of truth!
498 (1884)
To what extent even our intellect is a consequence of condi­
tions of existence— : we would not have it if we did not need to
have it, and we would not have it as it is if we did not need to
have it as it is, if we could live otherwise.
499 (1885)
“Thinking” in primitive conditions (pre-organic) is the crys­
tallization of forms, as in the case of crystal.—- In our thought,
the essential feature is fitting new material into old schemas ( =
Procrustes’ bed), making equal what is new.
500 (1885-1886)
Sense perceptions projected “outside” : “inside” and “out­
side”—-does the body command here— ?
The same equalizing and ordering force that rules in the
idioplasma, rules also in the incorporation of the outer world:
our sense perceptions are already the result of this assimilation
and equalization in regard to all the past in us; they do not follow
directly upon the “impression”—
501 (1886-1887)
All thought, judgment, perception, considered as comparison,

274

THE

WILL

TO PO WE R

has as its precondition a "positing of equality,” and earlier still
a “making equal.” The process of making equal is the same as
the process of incorporation of appropriated material in the
amoeba.
“Memory” late, in so far as here the drive to make equal
seems already to have been subdued: differentiation is preserved.
Remembering as a process of classification and pigeonholing: who
is active?
502 (1885)
One must revise one’s ideas about memory, here lies the
•chief temptation to assume a “soul,” which, outside time, repro­
duces, recognizes, etc. But that which is experienced lives on “in
the memory” ; I cannot help it if it “comes back,” the will is
inactive in this case, as in the coming of any thought. Something
happens of which I become conscious: now something similar
comes—who called it? roused it?
503 (1884)
The entire apparatus of knowledge is an apparatus for ab­
straction and simplification— directed not at knowledge but at
taking possession of things: “end” and “means” are as remote
from its essential nature as are “concepts.” With “end” and
“means” one takes possession of the process (one invents a process
that can be grasped); with “concepts,” however, of the “things”
that constitute the process.

Consciousness— beginning quite externally, as coordination
and becoming conscious of “impressions”— at first at the furthest
distance from the biological center of the individual; but a process
that deepens and intensifies itself, and continually draws nearer
to that center.

Our perceptions, as we understand them: i.e., the sum of all
those perceptions the becoming-conscious of which was useful

and essential to us and to the entire organic process—therefore
not all perceptions in general (e. g., not the electric); this means:
we have senses for only a selection of perceptions—those with
which we have to concern ourselves in order to preserve oufselves.
Consciousness is present only to the extent that consciousness is
useful. It cannot be doubted that all sense perceptions are per­
meated with? value judgments (useful and harmful— consequently,
pleasant or unpleasant). Each individual color is also for us an
expression of value (although we seldom admit it, or do so only
after a protracted impression of exclusively the same color; e.g.,
a prisoner in prison, or a lunatic). Thus insects also react differently
to different colors: some like [this color, some that];7 e.g., ants.
506 (1884)
First images—to explain how images arise in the spirit. Then
words, applied to images. Finally concepts, possible only when
there are words— the collecting together of many images in some­
thing nonvisible but audible (w ord). The tiny amount of emotion to
which the “word” gives rise, as we contemplate similar images for
which one word exists—this weak emotion is the common element,
the basis of the concept. That weak sensations are regarded as alike,
sensed as being the same, is the fundamental fact. Thus confusion
of two sensations that are close neighbors, as we take note of these
sensations; but who is taking note? Believing is the primal beginning
even in every sense impression: a kind of affirmation the first
intellectual activity! A “holding-true” in the beginning! Therefore
it is to be explained: how “holding-true” arose! What sensation
lies behind “true”?
507 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The valuation “I believe that this and that is so” as the
essence at "truth.” In valuations are expressed conditions of pre­
servation and growth. All our organs of knowledge and our senses
are developed only with regard to conditions of preservation and
'Emphasis mine, to call attention to an exceptionally interesting state­
ment. In the original the preceding sentence is emphasized, but in this one
only “value judgments.”

growth. Trust in reason and its categories, in dialectic, therefore
the valuation of logic, proves only their usefulness for life, proved
by experience— not that something is true.
That a great deal of belief must be present; that judgments
may be ventured; that doubt concerning all essential values is
lacking—that is the precondition of every living thing and its life.
Therefore, what is needed is that something must be held to be
true— not that something is true,
“The real and the apparent world”— I have traced this anti­
thesis back to value relations. We have projected the conditions
of our preservation as predicates of being in general. Because we
have to be stable in our beliefs if we are to prosper, we have made
the “real” world a world not of change and becoming, but one of
being.

5. Origin of Reason and Logic
508 (1883-1888)
Originally a chaos of ideas. The ideas that were consistent
with ones another remained, the greater number perished—and are
perishing.

On the origin of logic. The fundamental inclination to posit
as equal, to see things as equal, is modified, held in check, by
consideration of usefulness and harmfulness, by considerations
of success: it adapts itself to a milder degree in which it can be
satisfied without at the same time denying and endangering life.
This whole process corresponds exactly to that external, mechanical
process (which is its symbol) by which protoplasm makes what
it appropriates equal to itself and fits it into its own forms and
files.

book th re e :

511 ( 1885-1886)
Equality and similarity.
1. The coarser organ sees much apparent equality;
2. the spirit wants equality, i.e., tq subsume a sense impression
into an existing series: in the same way as the body assimilates
inorganic matter.
Toward an understanding of logic:
the will to equality is the will to power—the belief that
something is thus and thus (the essence of judgment) is
the consequence of a will that as much as possible shall be
equal.
512 (1885)
Logic is bound to the condition: assume there are identical
cases. In fact, to make possible logical thinking and inferences,
this condition must first be treated fictitously as fulfilled. That is:
the will to logical truth can be carried through only after a funda­
mental falsification of all events is assumed. From which it follows
that a drive rules here that is capable of employing both means,
firstly falsification, then the implementation of its own point of
view: logic does not spring from will to truth.
513 (Fall 1886)
The inventive force that invented categories labored in the
Service of our needs, namely of our need for security, for quick
understanding on the basis of Signs and sounds, for means of
abbreviation:— ‘substance,” “subject,” “object,” “being,” “becom­
ing” have nothing to do with metaphysical truths.—
It is the powerful who made the names of things into law,
and among the powerful it is the greatest artists in abstraction who
created the categories.
514 (March-June 1888)
A morality, a mode of living tried and proved by long ex­
perience and testing, at length enters consciousness as a law, as
dominating— And therewith the entire group of related values and
states enters into it: it becomes venerable, unassailable, holy, true;

it is part of its development that its origin should be forgotten—
That is a sign it has become master—
Exactly the same thing could have happened with the cate­
gories of reason: they could have prevailed, after much groping
and fumbling, through their relative utility— There came a point
when one collected them together, raised them to consciousness as
a whole— and when one commanded them, i.e., when they had
the effect of a command— From then on, they counted as a priori,
as beyond experience, as irrefutable. Arid yet perhaps they repre­
sent nothing more than the expediency of a Certain race and species
— their utility alone is their “truth”—
515 CMarch-June 1888)
Not “to know” but to schematize— to impose upon chaos as
much regularity and form as our practical needs require.
In the formation of reason, logic, the categories, it was need
that was authoritative; the need, not to “know,” but to subsume, to
schematize, for the purpose of intelligibility and calculation-— (The
development of reason is adjustment, invention, with the aim of
making similar, equal—the same process that every sense im­
pression goes through!) No pre-existing “idea” was here at work,
but the utilitarian fact that only when we see things coarsely and
made equal do they become calculable and usable to us— Finality
in reason is an effect, not a cause: life miscarries with any other
kinds of reason, to which there is a continual impulse— it becomes
difficult to survey— too unequal—
The categories are “truths”’ only in the sense that they are
conditions of life for us: as Euclidean space is a conditional8
“truth.” (Between ourselves: since no one would maintain that
there is any necessity for men to exist, reason, as well as Euclidean
space, is a mere idiosyncracy of a certain species of animal, and
one among many— )
The subjective compulsion not to contradict here is a biolo­
gical compulsion: the instinct for the utility of inferring as we do
infer is part of us, we almost are this instinct— But what naivete
to extract from this a proof that we are therewith in possession

ing). The editors took their cue from Kant, not from Nietzsche’s next sen­

of a “truth in itself”!— Not being able to contradict is proof of
an incapacity, not of “truth.”
516 {Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
We are unable to affirm and to deny one and the same thing:
this is a subjective empirical law, not the expression of any
“necessity” but only of an inability.
If, according to Aristotle, the law of contradiction is the most
certain of all principles, if it is the ultimate and most basic, upon
which every demonstrative proof rests, if the principle of every
axiom lies in it; then one should consider all the more rigorously
what presuppositions already lie at the bottom of it. Either it
asserts something about actuality,, about being, as if one already
knew this from another source; that is, as if opposite attributes
could not be ascribed to it. Or the proposition means: opposite
attributes should not be ascribed to it. In that case, logic would be
an imperative, not to know the true, but to posit and arrange a
world that shall be called true by us.
In short, the question remains open: are the axioms of logic
adequate to reality or are they a means and measure for us to
create reality, the concept “reality,” for ourselves?— To affirm
the former one would, as already said, have to have a previous
knowledge of being— which is certainly not the case. The propo­
sition therefore contains no criterion of; truth, but an imperative
concerning that which should count as true.
Supposing there were no self-identical " A ”, such as is pre­
supposed by every proposition of logic (and of mathematics), and
the "A ” were already mere appearance, then logic would have a
merely apparent world as its condition. In fact, we believe in this
proposition under the influence of ceaseless experience which
seems continually to confirm it. The “thing”— that is the real
substratum of "A ”; our belief in things is the precondition of our
belief in logic. The "A ” of logic is, like the atom, a reconstruction
of the thing— If we do not grasp this, but make of logic a criterion
of true being, we are on the way to positing as realities all those
hypostases: substance, attribute, object, subject, action, etc.; that
is, to conceiving a metaphysical world, that is, a “real world”
(— this, however, is the apparent world once more— ).
The very first acts of thought, affirmation and denial, holding

280

t h e

w i l l

to

p o w e r

true and holding not true, are, in as much as they presuppose,
not only the habit of holdings things true and holding them not
true, but a right to do this, already dominated by the belief that we
can gain possession of knowledge, that judgments really can hit
upon the truth;— in short, logic does not doubt its ability to assert
something about the true-in-itself (namely, that it cannot have
opposite attributes).
Here reigns the coarse sensualistic prejudice that sensations
teach us truths about things— that I cannot say at the same time
o f one and the same thing that it is hard and that it is soft. (The
instinctive proof “I cannot have two opposite sensations at the
same time”—-quite coarse and false.)
The conceptual ban on contradiction proceeds from the
belief that we are able to form concepts, that the concept not
only designates the essence of a thing but comprehends it— In
fact, logic (like geometry and arithmetic) applies only to fictitious
entities that we have created. Logic is the attempt to comprehend
the actual world by iheatis of a scheme of being posited by our­
selves; more correctly, to make it forfflulatable and calculable for

us—
517 (Spring-Fall 1 88?)
In order to think and infer it is necessary to assume beings:
logic handles only formulas for what remains the same. That is
why this assumption would not be proof of reality: “beings” are
part of our perspective. The “ego” as a being (—not affected by
becoming and development).
The fictitious world of subject, substance, “reason,” etc., is
needed— : there is in us a power to order, simplify, falsify, arti­
ficially distinguish. “Truth” is the will to be master over the
multiplicity of sensations:—to classify phenomena into definite
categories. In this we start from a belief in the “in-itself” of things
(we take phenomena as real) .
The character of the world in a state of becoming as incapable
of formulation, as “false,” as ‘“self-contradictory.” Knowledge and
becoming exclude one another. Consequently, “knowledge” must
be something else: there must first of all be a will to make knowable, a kind of becoming must itself create the deception of beings.

BOOK t h r e e :

518 ( 1885-1886)
If our “ego” is for us the sole being, after the model of which
we fashion and understand all being: very well! Then there would
be very much room to doubt whether what we have here is not a
perspective illusion— an apparent unity that encloses everything
like a horizon. The evidence of the body reveals a tremendous
multiplicity; it is allowable, for purposes of method, to employ the
more easily studied, richer phenomena as evidence for the un­
derstanding of the poorer. Finally: supposing everything is be­
coming, then knowledge is possible only on the basis of belief in
being.
519 (1883-1888)
If there “is only one being, the ego” and all other “being”
is fashioned after its model— if, finally, belief in the “ego” stands
or falls with belief in logic, i.e., the metaphysical truth of the
categories of reason; if, on the other hand, the ego proves to be
something in a state of becoming: then—
520 (1885)
Continual transition forbids us to speak of “individuals,” etc;
the “number” of beings is itself in flux. We would know nothing
of time and motion if we did not, in a coarse fashion, believe we
see what is at “rest” beside what is in motion. The same applies
to cause and effect, and without the erroneous conception of
“empty space” we should certainly not have acquired the con­
ception of space. The principle of identity has behind it the
“apparent fact” of things that are the same. A world in a state
of becoming could not, in a strict sense, be “comprehended” or
“known”; only to the extent that the “comprehending” and “know­
ing” intellect encounters a coarse, already-created world, fabricated
out of mere appearances but become firm to the extent that this
kind of appearance has preserved life— only to this extent is there
anything like “knowledge” ; i.e., a measuring of earlier and later
errors by one another.

282

THE WILL

TO P O W E R

521 (Spring-Fall 1887)
On “logical semblance”— The concepts “individual” and
“species” equally false and merely apparent. “Species” expresses
only the fact that an abundance of similar creatures appear at the
same time and that the tempo of their further growth and change
is for a long time slowed down, so actual small continuations
and increases are not very much noticed (— a phase of evolution in
which the evolution is not visible, so an equilibrium seems to have
been attained, making possible the false notion that a goal has
been attained—and that evolution has a goal— ).
The form counts as something enduring and therefore more
valuable; but the form has merely been invented by us; and how­
ever often “the same form is attained,” it does not mean that
it is the same form— what appears is always something new, and
it is only we, who are always comparing, who include the new, to
the extent that it is similar to the old, in the unity of the “form,”
As if a type should be attained and, as it were, was intended by
and inherent in the process of formation.
Form, species, law, idea, purpose—in all these cases the
same error is made of giving a false reality to a fiction, as if events
were in some way obedient to something—an artificial distinction
is made in respect of events between that which acts and that
toward which the act is directed (but this “which” and this
“toward” are only posited in obedience to our metaphysicaHogical
dogmatism: they are not “facts” ).
One should not understand this compulsion to construct
concepts, species, forms, purposes, laws (“a world of identical
cases” ) as if they enabled us to fix the real world; but as a com­
pulsion to arrange a world for ourselves in which our existence is
made possible:—we thereby create a world which is calculable,
simplified, comprehensible, etc., for us.
This same compulsion exists in the sense activities that support
reason—by simplification, coarsening, emphasizing, and elaborat­
ing, upon which all “recognition,” all ability to make oneself
intelligible rests. Our needs have made our senses so precise that
the “same apparent world” always reappears and has thus acquired
the semblance of reality.
Our subjective compulsion to believe in logic only reveals
that, long before logic itself entered our consciousness, we did

book th re e :

Principles of A New Evaluation

283

nothing but introduce its postulates into events: now we discover
them in events—we can no longer do otherwise— and imagine
that this compulsion guarantees something connected with “truth.”
It is we who created the “thing,” the “identical thing,” subject,
attribute, activity, object, substance, form, after we had long
pursued the process of making identical, coarse and simple. The
world seems logical to us because we have made it logical.
522 (1886-1887)
Ultimate solution.— We believe in reason: this, however, is
the philosophy of gray concepts. Language depends on the most
naive prejudices.
Now we read disharmonies and problems into things because
we think only in the form of language— and thus believe in the
“eternal truth” of “reason” (e.g., subject, attribute, etc.)
We cease to think when we refuse to dp so under the constraint
of language; we barely reach the doubt that sees this limitation as
a limitation.
Rational thought is interpretation according to a scheme that
we cannot throw off.

6. Consciousness
523 (March-June 1888)
Nothing is more erroneous than to make of psychical and
physical phenomena the two faces, the two revelations of one and
the same substance; Nothing is explained thereby: the concept
“substance” is perfectly useless as an explanation. Consciousness
in a subsidiary role, almost indifferent, superfluous, perhaps destined
to vanish and give way to a perfect automatism—
When we observe only the inner phenomena we may be
compared with the deaf-and-dumb, who divine through movements
of the lips the words they do not hear. From the phenomena of
the inner sense we conclude the existence of invisible and other
phenomena that we would apprehend if our means of observation
were adequate and that one calls the nerve current.
We8 lack any sensitive organs for this inner world, so we sense
* Not a real sentence in the MS where this paragraph begins: “That an
inner world, for which we lack . .

284

THE W ILL

TO P O W E R

a thousandfold complexity as a unity; so we introduce causation
where any reason for motion and change remains invisible to us
— the sequence of thoughts and feelings is only their becomingvisible in consciousness. That this sequence has anything to do
with a causal chain is completely unbelievable: consciousness has
never furnished us with an example of cause and effect.
524 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
The role of "consciousness— It is essential that one should
not make a mistake over the role of “consciousness” : it is our
relation with the “outer world” that evolved it. On the other hand,
the direction or protection and care in respect of the co-ordination
of the bodily functions does not enter our consciousness; any more
than spiritual accumulation: that a higher court rules over these
things cannot be doubted— a kind of directing committee on which
the various chief desires make their votes and power felt. “Pleasure,”
“displeasure” are hints from this sphere; also the act of will; also
ideas.
In summa: That which becomes conscious is involved in
causal relations which are entirely withheld from us— the sequence
of thoughts, feelings, ideas in consciousness does not signify that
this sequence is a causal sequence; but apparently it is so, to the
highest degree. Upon this appearance we have founded our whole
idea of spirit, reason, logic, etc. (—none of these exist: they are
fictitious syntheses and unities), and projected these into things
and behind things!
Usually, one takes consciousness itself as the general sensorium and supreme court; nonetheless, it is only a means of com­
munication: it is evolved through social intercourse and with a view
to the interests of social intercourse— “Intercourse” here under­
stood to include the influences of the outer world and the reactions
they compel on our side; also our effect upon the outer world. It
is not the directing agent, but an organ of the directing agent.
525 (1888)
My proposition compressed into a formula that smells of
antiquity, Christianity, scholasticism, and other muskiness: in the
concept “God as spirit,” God as perfection is negated—

book th re b ;

285

526 (March-June 1888)
Where a certain unity obtains in the grouping of things, one
has always posited spirit as the cause of this coordination: for
which notion there is no ground whatever. Why should the idea
of a complex fact be one of the conditions of this fact? or why
shoujd the notion of a complex fact have to precede it as its
cause?—
We shall be on our guard against explaining purposiveness
in terms of spirit: there is no ground whatever for ascribing to
spirit the properties of organization and systematization. The
nervous system has a much more extensive domain; the world of
consciousness is added to it. Consciousness plays no role in the
total process of adaptation and systematization.
527 (1886-1887)
Physiologists, like philosophers, believe that consciousness
increases in value in proportion as it increases in clarity: the
clearest consciousness, the most logical and coldest thinking, is
supposed to be of the first rank. However—by what measure is
this value determined?— In regard to release of will, the most
superficial, most simplified thinking is the most useful— it could
therefore—etc. (because it leaves few motives oyer).
Precision in action is antagonistic to far-seeing providentiality,
the judgments of which are often uncertain: the latter is led by
the deeper instinct.
528 ( 1886-1887)
Principal error of psychologists: they regard the indistinct
idea as a lower kind of idea than the distinct: but that which
removes itself from our consciousness and for that reason becomes
obscure can on that account be perfectly clear in itself. Becoming
obscure is a matter of perspective of consciousness.
529 (March-June 1888)
Tremendous blunders:
1. the absurd overestimation of consciousness, the transfer-

286

THE

TO J P O W E R

mation of it into a unity, an entity: “spirit,” “soul,” something that
feels, thinks, wills—
2. spirit as cause, especially wherever purposiveness, system,
co-ordination appear;
3. consciousness as the highest achieveable form, as the
supreme kind of being, as “God”;
4. will introduced wherever there are effects;
5. the “real World” as a Spiritual world, as accessible through
the facts of consciousness;
6. knowledge as uniquely the faculty Of consciousness
wherever there is knowledge at all.
Consequences:
every advance lies in an advance in becoming conscious;
every regression in becoming unconscious; (— becoming un­
conscious was considered a falling back to the desires and senses
— as becoming animal— )
one approaches reality, “real being,” through dialectic; one
distances oneself from it through the instincts, senses, mecha­
nism—
to resolve man into spirit would mean to make him into God:
spirit, will, goodness— all One;
all good must proceed from spirituality, must be a fact of
consciousness;
any advance toward the better can only be an advance in
becoming conscious.

7. Judgment. True— False
530 (1883-1888)
In the case of Kant, theological prejudice, his unconscious
dogmatism, his moralistic perspective, were dominant, directing,
commanding.
The proton pseudos:10 how is the fact of knowledge possible?
is knowledge a fact at all? what is knowledge? If we do not know
what knowledge is, we cannot possibly answer the question whether
there is knowledge.— Very well! But if I do not already “know”
whether there is knowledge, whether there can be knowledge, I
cannot reasonably put the question “what is knowledge?” Kant
” First falsehood or original error.

book th re e :

Principles of A New Evaluation

287

believes in the fact of knowledge: what he wants is a piece of
naivete: knowledge of knowledge!
“Knowledge is judgment!” But judgment is a belief that some­
thing is thus and thus! And not knowledge! “All knowledge consists
of synthetic judgments” of universal validity (the case is thus and
not otherwise in every case), of necessary validity (the opposite
of the assertion can never occur).
The legitimacy of belief in knowledge is always presupposed:
just as the legitimacy of the feelings of conscience-judgments is
presupposed. Here moral ontology is the dominant prejudice.
The conclusion is therefore:
1. there are assertions that we consider universally valid and
necessary;
2. necessity and universal validity cannot be derived from
experience;:;
3. consequently they must be founded, not upon experience,
but upon something else, and derive from another source of
knowledge! , :
(Kant infers (1) there are assertions which are valid only
under a certain condition; (2 ) this condition is that they derive,
not from experience, but from pure reason.)
Therefore: the question is, whence do we derive our reasons
for believing in the truth of such assertions? No, how our belief
is causedl But the origin of , a belief, of a strong conviction, is a
psychological problem: and a very narrow and limited experience
often produces such a belief! It already presupposes that there
is not "data a posteriori” but also data a priori, “preceding ex­
perience.” Necessity and universal validity could never be given
to us by experience: why does that mean that they are present
without any experience at all?
There are no isolated judgments!
An isolated judgment is never “true,” never knowledge; only
in the connection and relation of many judgments is there any
surety.
What distinguishes the true from the false belief? What is
knowledge? He “knows” it, that is heavenly!
Necessity and universality can never be given by experience!
Thus they are independent of experience, prior to all experience!
That insight that occurs a priori, therefore independently of all
experience, out of sheer reason, is “a pure form of knowledge” !
“The basic laws of logic, the law of identity and the law of

288

THE W IL L

TO P O W E R

contradiction, are forms of pure knowledge* because they precede
all experience.”— But these are not forms of knowledge at all!
they are regulative articles of belief.
To establish the a priori character (the pure rationality) of the
judgments of mathematics, space must be conceived as a form of
pure reason.
Hume had declared: “There are no synthetic a priori judg­
ments.” Kant says: But there are! Those of mathematics! And
if there are such judgments, perhaps there is also metaphysics, a
knowledge of things by pure reason!
Mathematics is possible under conditions under which meta­
physics is never possible. All human knowlege is either experience
or mathematics.
A judgment is synthetic; i.e., it connects different ideas.
It is a priori; i.e., every connection is a universally valid and
necessary one, which can never be given by sense perception but
only through pure reason.
If there are to be synthetic a priori judgments, then reason
must be in a position to make connections: connection is a form.
Reason must possess the capacity of giving form.
531 (1885-1886)
Judgment is our oldest belief, our mdst habitual holding-true
or holding-untrue, an assertion or denial, a certainty that something
is thus and not otherwise, a belief that here we really “know”—
what is it that is believed true in all judgments?
What are attributes?-^—We have not regarded change in us as
change but as an “in itself’ that is foreign to us, that we merely
“perceive” : and we have posited it, not as an event, but as a being,
as a “quality”— and in addition invented an entity to which it
adheres; i.e., we have regarded the effect as something that effects,
and this we have regarded as a being. But even in this formulation,
the concept “effect” is arbitrary: for those changes that take place
in us, and that we firmly believe we have not ourselves caused, we
merely infer to be effects, in accordance with the conclusion:
“every change must have an author”;—but this conclusion is
already mythology: it separates that Which effects from the effecting.
If I say “lightning flashes,” I have posited the flash once as an
activity and a second time as a subject, and thus added to the
event a being that is not one with the event but is rather fixed, is,

book th re e :

Principles of A New Evaluation

289

and does not “become.”— To regard an event as an “effecting,”
and this as being, that is the double error, or interpretation, of
which we are guilty.
532 (1885)
Judgment—this is the belief: ‘This and that are so.” Thus
there is in every judgment the avowal of having encountered an
“identical case” : it therefore presupposes comparison with the
aid of memory. The judgment does not produce the appearance of
an identical case. Rather it believes it perceives one: it works
under the presupposition that identical cases exist. Now, what is
that function that must be much older and must have been at work
much earlier, that makes cases identical and similar which are in
themselves dissimilar? What is that second function, which on the
basis of the first, etc. “Whatever arouses the same sensation is the
same” : but what is it that makes sensations the same, “accepts”
them as the same? There could be no judgments at all if a kind
of equalization were not practiced within sensations: memory is
possible only with a continual emphasizing of what is already
familiar, experienced.— Before judgment occurs, the process of
assimilation must already have taken place; thus here, too, there
is an intellectual activity that does not enter consciousness, as pain
does as a consequence of a wound. Probably an inner event
corresponds to each organic function; hence assimilation, rejection,
growth, etc.
Essential: to start from the body and employ it as guide. It
is the much richer phenomenon, which allows of clearer observa­
tion. Belief in the body is better established than belief in the
spirit.
“No matter how strongly a thing may be believed, strength
of belief is no criterion of truth.” But what is truth? Perhaps a
kind of belief that has become a condition of life? In that case,
to be sure, strength could be a criterion; e.g., in regard to causality.

with that, the mechanical hypothesis concerning the world is desired
and credible.
But this is a crude confusion: like simplex sigillum veri.ls
How does one know that the real nature of things stands in this
relation to our intellect?— Could it not be otherwise? that it is
the hypothesis that gives the intellect the greatest feeling of power
and security, that is most preferred, valued and consequently
characterized as true?— The intellect posits its freest and strongest
capacity and capability as criterion of the most valuable, con­
sequently of the true—
“True” : from the standpoint of feeling— : that which excites
the feeling most strongly ( “ego” );
from the standpoint of thought— : that which gives thought
the greatest feeling of strength;
from the standpoint of touch, seeing, hearing— : that which
calls for the greatest resistance.
Thus it is the highest degrees of performance that awaken
belief in the “truth,” that is to say reality, of the object. The feeling
of strength, of struggle, of resistance convinces us that there is
something that is here being resisted.
534 ( 1887-1888)
The criterion of truth resides in the enhancement of the feeling
of power.
535 (1885) 1B
“Truth” : this, according to my way of thinking, does not
necessarily denote the antithesis of error, but in the most funda­
mental cases only the posture of various errors in relation to one
another. Perhaps one is older, more profound than another, even
ineradicable, in so far as an organic entity of our species could not
live without it; while other errors do not tyrannize over us in this
way as conditions of life, but on the contrary when compared with
such “tyrants” can be set aside and “refuted.”
An assumption that is irrefutable— why should it for that
reason be “true”? This proposition may perhaps outrage logicians,

who posit their limitations as the limitations of things: but I long

Everything simple is merely imaginary, is not “true,” But
whatever is real, whatever is true, is lieither one nor even,,reducible

What is truth?— Inertia; that hypothesis which gives rise to
contentment; smallest expenditure of spiritual force, etc.
538 ( 1883-1888)
First proposition. The easier mode of thought conquers the
harder mode;— as dogma: simplex sigiltiim yerL— Dico:u to sup­
pose that clarity proves anything about truth is perfect childish­
ness—
Second proposition. The doctrine of being, of things, of all
sorts of fixed unities is a hundred times easier than the doctrine of
becoming, of development—
Third proposition. Logic was intended as facilitation; as a
means of expression— not as truth— Later it acquired the effect
of truth—

at the other extreme, and say “what can be thought of must cer­

If the character of existence should be false—which would be
possible— what would truth, all our truth, be then?— An un­
conscionable falsification of the false? The false raised to a higher
power?—
543 (Nov, 1887-March 1888)
In a world that is essentially false, truthfulness would be an
antinatural tendency: such a tendency could have meaning only
as a means to a higher power of falsehood. In order for a world
of the true, of being, to be invented, the truthful man would first
have to be created (including the fact that such a man believes him­
self “truthful” ).
Simple, transparent, not in contradiction with himself, durable,
remaining always the same, without wrinkle, volt, concealment,
form: a man of this kind conceives a world of being as “God” in
his own image.
For truthfulness to be possible, the whole sphere of man must
be very clean, small and, respectable; advantage in every sense
must be with the truthful man.— Lies, deception, dissimulation
must arouse astonishment—

8. Against Causalism
545 (1885)
I believe in absolute space as the substratum of force: the
latter limits and forms. Time eternal. But space and time do not
exist in themselves. “Changes” are only appearances (or sense
processes for us); if we posit the recurrence of these, however
regular, nothing is established thereby except this simple fact,
that it has always happened thus. The feeling that post hoc is
propter hoc can easily be shown to be a misunderstanding; it is
comprehensible. But appearances cannot be “causes”!
546 (1885-1886)
The interpretation of an event as either an act or the suffering
of an act (— thus every act a suffering) says: every change, every
17Nietzsche copied a passage from Stendhal’s Vie de Napoleon (“Life
of Napoleon,” Preface, p. xv) into another notebook: “Une croyance presque

19 Bevor “gedacht'* wird , muss schon "gedichtef* worden sein. The
phrase Das Volk der Dichter und Denker (gedacht is the past participle of
denken) means ‘‘the people of thinkers and poets ” and dichten usually
means writing poetry. But the title of Goethe’s autobiographical Dichtung
und Wahrheit means “Fiction and Truth” no less than “Poetry land Truth,”
and erdichten generally means to make up, to invent. In the present work
erdichtet has generally been rendered as invented; but this is a good place
to insist that this translation loses some essential overtones: the emphatic
contrast with reality-in-itself is intended by Nietzsche, but he also means
to stress the quasi-poetic function of the imagination.

becoming-other, presupposes an author and someone upon whom
“change” is effected.
547 (1885-1886)
Psychological history of the concept “subject.” The body, the
thing, the “whole” construed by the eye, awaken the distinction
between a deed and a doer; the doer, the cause of the deed, con­
ceived ever more subtly, finally left behind the "subject.”
548 (1885-1886)
Our bad habit of taking a mnemonic, an abbreviative formula,
to be an entity, finally as a cause, e.g., to say of lightning “it
flashes.” Or the little word “I.” To make a kind of perspective
in seeing the cause of seeing: that was what happened in the
invention of the “subject,” the “I” !
549 (1885)
“Subject,” “object,” “attribute”— these distinctions are fabri­
cated and are now imposed as a schematism upon all the appar­
ent facts. The fundamental false observation is that I believe it
is I who do something, suffer something, “have” something,
“have” a quality.
550 (1885-1886)
In every judgment there resides the entire, full, profound
belief in subject and attribute, or in cause and effect (that is,
as the assertion that every effect is an activity and that every
activity presupposes an agent); and this latter belief is only
a special case of the former, so there remains as the fundamental
belief the belief that there are subjects, that everything that hap­
pens is related attributively to some subject.19
I notice something and seek a reason for it; this means
originally: I seek an intention in it, and above all someone who
has intentions, a subject, a doer: every event a deed—formerly

one saw intentions in all events, this is our oldest habit. Do ani­
mals also possess it? As living beings, must they not also rely
on interpretations based on themselves?—
The question “why?” is always a question after the causa
finalis,20 after the “what for?” We have no “sense for the
causa efficiens” :21 here Hume was right; habit (but not only
that of the individual!) makes us expect that a certain oftenobserved occurrence will follow another: nothing more! That
which gives the extraordinary firmness to our belief in causality
is not the great habit of seeing one occurrence following another
but our inability to interpret events otherwise than as events
caused by intentions. It is belief in the living and thinking a«5
the only effective force— in will, in intention—it is belief that
every event is a deed, that every deed presupposes a doer, it is
belief in the ‘‘subject.” Is this belief in the concept of subject
and attribute not a great stupidity?
Question: is intention the cause of an event? Or is that also
illusion?
Is it not the event itself?
551 (March-June 1888)
Critique of the concept “cause”22— We have absolutely
no experience of a cause; psychologically considered, we derive
the entire concept from the subjective conviction that we are
causes, namely, that the arm moves— But that is an error. We
separate ourselves, the doers, from the deed, and we make use of
this pattern everywhere— we seek a doer for every event. What
is it we have done? We have misunderstood the feeling of
strength, tension, resistance, a muscular feeling that is already
the beginning of the act, as the cause, or we have taken the
will to do this or that for a cause because the action follows
upon it—cause, i.e.,-----There is no such thing as “cause”; some cases in which

the starting point of ‘will to power’ as the origin of motion. Hence motion

it seemed to be given us, and in which we have projected it out
of ourselves in order to understand an event, have been shown
to be self-deceptions. Our “understanding of an event” has con­
sisted in our inventing a subject which was made responsible
for something that happens and for how it happens. We have
combined our feeling of will, our feeling of “freedom,” our feel­
ing of responsibility and our intention to perform an act, into
the concept “cause” : causa efficiens and causa finalis are funda­
mentally one.
We believed that an effect was explained when a condition
was detected in which the effect was already inherent. In fact,
we invent all causes after the schema of the effect: the latter
is known to us— Conversely, we are not in a position to predict
of any thing what it will “effect.” The thing, the subject, will,
intention— all inherent in the conception “cause.” We search for
things in order to explain why something has changed. Even
the atom is this kind of super-added “thing” and “primitive sub­
ject”—
At length we grasp that things—consequently atoms, too—
effect nothing: because they do not exist at all— that the concept
of causality is completely useless.— A necessary sequence of
states does not imply a causal relationship between them (— that
would mean making their effective capacity leap from 1 to 2,
to 3, to 4, to 5). There are neither causes nor effects. Linguisti­
cally we do not know how to rid ourselves of them. But that
does not matter. If I think of the muscle apart from its “effects,”
I negate it—
In summa: an event is neither effected nor does it effect.
Causa is a capacity to produce effects that has been super-added
to the events—
Interpretation by causality a deception— A “thing” is the
sum of its effects, synthetically united by a concept, an image. In
fact, science has emptied the concept causality of its content and
retained it as a formula of an equation, in which it has become
at bottom a matter of indifference on which side cause is placed
and on which side effect. It is asserted that in two complex states
(constellations of force) the quanta of force remain constant.
The calculability of an event does not reside in the fact
that a rule is adhered to, or that a necessity is obeyed, or that a
law of causality has been projected by us into every event: it

book th re e :

Principles of A New Evaluation

297

resides in the recurrence of "identical cases ”
There is no such thing as a sense of causality, as Kant thinks.
One is surprised, one is disturbed, one desires something familiar
to hold on to— As soon as we are shown something old in the
new, we are calmed. The supposed instinct for causality is only
fear of the unfamiliar and the attempt to discover something
familiar in it— a search, not for causes, but for the familiar.
552 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Against determinism and teleology.— From the fact that
something ensues regularly and ensues calculabtyj it does not fol­
low that it ensues necessarily. That a quantum of force deter­
mines and conducts itself in every particular case in one way
and manner does not make it into an “unfree will.” “Mechanical
necessity” is not a fact: it is We who first interpreted it into
events. We have interpreted the formulatable character of events
as the consequence of a necessity that rules over events. But from
the fact that I do a certain thing, it by no means follows that
I am compelled to do it. Compulsion in things certainly cannot
be demonstrated: the rule proves only that one and the same event
is not another event as well. Only because we have introduced
subjects, “doers,” into things does it appear that all events are
the consequences of compulsion exerted upon subjects— exerted
by whom? again by a “doer.” Cause and effect—a dangerous con­
cept so long as one thinks of something that causes and some­
thing upon which an effect is produced.
a. Necessity is not a fact but an interpretation.
*
b. When one has grasped that the “subject” is not something
that creates effects, but Only a fiction, much follows.
It is only after the model of the subject that we have invented
the reality of things and projected them into the medley of sensa­
tions. If we no longer believe in the effective subject, then belief
also disappears in effective things, in reciprocation, cause and
effect between those phenomena that we call things.
There also disappears, of course, the world of effective atoms:
the assumption of which always depended on the supposition that
one needed subjects.

298

THE WILL

TO P O W E R

At last, the “thing-in-itself” also disappears, because this
is fundamentally the conception of a “subject-in-itself.” But we
have grasped that the subject is a fiction. The antithesis “thingin-itself” and “appearance” is untenable; with that, however, the
concept “appearance” also disappears.

c. If we give up the effective subject, we also give up the
object upon which effects are produced. Duration, identity with
itself, being are inherent neither in that which is called subject
nor in that which is called object: they are complexes of events
apparently durable in comparison with other complexes— e.g.,
through the difference in tempo of the event (rest-—motion, firm
— loose: opposites that do not exist in themselves and that actually
express only variations in degree that from a certain perspective
appear to be opposites. There are no opposites:23 only from those
of logic do we derive the concept of opposites— and falsely transfer
it to things).
d. If we: give up the concept “subject” and “object,” then
also the concept “substance”--a n d as a consequence also the
various modifications of it, e.g., “matter,” “spirit,” and other
hypothetical entities, “the eternity and immutability of matter,”
etc. We have got rid of materiality.
From the standpoint Of morality, the world is false. But to
the extent that morality itself is a part of this wdrld, morality
is false.
Will to truth is a making firm, a making true and durable,
an abolition of the false character of things, a reinterpretation
of it into beings. “Truth” is therefore not something there, that
might be found or discovered— but something that must be cre­
ated and that gives a name to a process, or rather to a will to
overcome that has in itself no end— introducing truth, as a
processus in infinitum, an active determining—hot a becomingconscious of something that is in itself firm and determined. It
is a word for the “will to power.”
Life is founded upon the premise of a belief in enduring
and regularly recurring things; the more powerful life is, the

Man projects his drive to truth, his “goal” in a certain
sense, outside himself as a world that has being, as a metaphysical
world, as a “thing-in-itself,” as a world already in existence. His
needs as creator invent the world upon which he works, anticipate
it; this anticipation (this “belief” in truth) is his support.

The ‘“welfare of the individual” is just as imaginary as the

9. Thing-in-Itself and Appearance
553 (1886-1887)
The sore spot of Kant’s critical philosophy has gradually
become Visible even to dull eyes: Kant no longer has a right to his
distinction “ appearance” a id “thing-in-itself”— he had deprived
himself of the right to gb on distinguishing in this old familiar way,
in so far as he rejected as impermissible making inferences fiom
phenomena to a cause of phenomena—in accordance with his con­
ception of causality and its purely intra-phenomenal validity—
Which conception, on the other hand, already anticipates this dis­
tinction, as if the “thing-in-itself” were not only inferred but given.
554 (1885-1886)
Causalism.29— It is obvious that things-in-themselves cannot
be related to one another as cause and effect, nor can appearance
be so related to appearance; from which it follows that in a phi­
losophy that believes in things-in-themselvels and appearances the
concept “cause and effect” cannot be applied. Kant’s mistakes-----In fact, the concept “cause and effect” derives, psychologically
speaking, only from a mode of thought that believes that always
and everywhere will operates upon will—that believes only in liv­
ing things and fundamentally only in '‘souls’’ (and not in things).
Within the mechanistic view of the world (which is logic and its
application to space and time), that concept is reduced to the
formulas of mathematics— with which, as one must emphasize

again and again, nothing is ever comprehended, but rather desig­
nated and distorted.27
555 (1885-1886)
Against the scientific prejudice.28-— The biggest fable of all is
the fable of knowledge. One would like to know what things-inthemselves are; but behold, there are no things-in-themselves! But
even supposing there were an in-itself, an unconditioned thing, it
would for that very reason be unknowable! Something uncondi­
tioned cannot be known; otherwise it would not be unconditioned!
Coming to know, however, is always “placing oneself in a condi­
tional relation to something”;------ one who seeks to know the un­
conditioned desires that it should not concern him, and that this
same something should be of no concern to anyone. This involves
a contradiction, first, between wanting to know and the desire that
it not concern us (but why know at all, then?) and, secondly, be­
cause something that is of no concern to anyone is not at all, and
thus cannot be known at all.—
Coming to know means “to place oneself in a conditional re­
lation to something”; to feel oneself conditioned by something and
oneself to condition it—it is therefore under all circumstances estab­
lishing, denoting, and making-conscious of conditions (not forth­
coming, entities, things, what is “in-itself” ).
556 (1885-1886)
A “thing-in-itself” just as perverse as a “sense-in-itself,” a
“meaning-in-itself.” There are no “facts-in-themselves,” for a sense
must always be projected into them before there can be “facts.”
The question “what is that?” is an imposition of meaning from
some other viewpoint. “Essence,” the “essential nature,” is some­
thing perspective and already presupposes a multiplicity. At the
bottom of it there always lies “what is that for me?” (for us, for
all that lives, etc.)
A thing would be defined once all creatures had asked “what
is that?” and had answered their question. Supposing one single

creature, with its own relationships and perspectives for all things,
were missing, then the thing would not yet be “defined.”
In short: the essence of a thing is only an opinion about the
“thing.” Or rather: “it is considered” is the real “it is,” the sole
“this is.”
One may not ask: “who then interprets?” for the interpreta­
tion itself is a form of the will to power, exists (but not as a “being”
but as a process, a becoming) as an affect.
The origin of “things” is wholly the work of that which
imagines, thinks, wills, feels. The concept “thing” itself just as
much as all its qualities.— Even "the subject” is such a created
entity, a “thing” like all others: a simplification with the object
of defining the force which posits, invents, thinks, as distinct from
all individual positing, inventing, thinking as such. Thus a capacity
as distinct from all that is individual-—fundamentally, action col­
lectively considered with respect to all anticipated actions (action
and the probability of similar actions).
557 (1885-1886)
The properties of a thing are effects on other “things” :
if one removes other “things,” then a thing has no properties,
i.e., there is no thing without other things,
i.e., there is no “thing-in-itself.”
558 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The "thing-in-itself” nonsensical. If I remove all the relation­
ships, all the “properties,” all the "activities” of a thing, the thing
does not remain over; because thingness has only been invented
by us owing to the requirements of logic, thus with the aim of
defining, communication (to bind together the multiplicity of
relationships, properties, activities).

“Things that have a constitution in themselves”— a dogmatic
idea with which one must break absolutely.

from interpretation and subjectivity, is a quite idle hypothesis:
it presupposes that interpretation and subjectivity are not essential,
that a thing freed from all relationships would still be a thing.
Conversely, the apparent objective character of things: could
it not be merely a difference of degree within the subjective?— that
perhaps that which changes slowly presents itself to us as “object­
ively” enduring, being, “in-itself”— that the objective is only a
false concept of a genus and an antithesis within the subjective?
561 ( 1885-1886)
Suppose all unity were unity only as an organization? But
the “thing” in which we believe was only invented as a foundation
for the various attributes. If the thing “effects,” that means: we
conceive all the other properties which are present and momentarily
latent, as the cause of the emergence of one single property; i.e., we
take the sum of its properties— “ je” — as cause of the property “x ”:
which is utterly stupid and mad!
All unity is unity only as organization and co-operation— just
as a human community is a unity— as opposed to an atomistic
anarchy, as a pattern of domination that signifies a unity but is not
a unity,
562 ( 1883-1888)
“In the development of thought a point had to be reached at
which one realized that what one called the properties of things
were sensations of the feeling subject: a t this point the properties
ceased to belong to the thing.” The “thing-in-itself” remained.
The distinction between the thing-in-itself and the thing-for-us is
based on the older, naive form of perception which granted energy
to things; but analysis revealed that even force was only projected
into them, and likewise— substance. “The thing affects a subject”?
Root of the idea of substance in language, not in beings outside us!
The thing-in-itself is no problem at all!
Beings will have to be thought of as sensations that are no
longer based on something devoid of sensation.
In motion, no new content is given to sensation. That which
is, cannot contain motion: therefore it is a form of being.
N.B. The explanation of an event can be sought firstly:
through mental images of the event that precede it (aim s);

304

THE

secondly: through mental images that succeed it (the
mathematical-physical explanation).
One should not confuse the two. Thus: the physical explana­
tion, which is a symbolization of the world by means of sensation
and thought, can in itself never account for the origin of sensation
and thought; rather physics must construe the world of feeling
consistently as lacking feeling and aim— right up to the highest
human being. And teleology is only a history of purposes and
never physical!
563 ( 1886-1887)
Our “knowing” limits itself to establishing quantities; but
we cannot help feeling these differences in quantity as qualities.
Quality is a perspective truth for us; not an “in-itself.”
Our senses have a definite quantum as a mean within which
they function; i.e., we sense bigness and smallness in relation to
the conditions of our existence. If we sharpened or blunted our
"senses tenfold, we should perish; i.e., with regard to making possible
our existence we sense even relations between magnitudes as
qualities.
564 ( 1885-1886)
Might all quantities not be signs of qualities? A greater
power implies a different consciousness, feeling, desiring, a dif­
ferent perspective; growth itself is a desire to be more; the desire
for an increase in quantum grows from a quale?* in a purely
quantitative world everything would be dead, stiff, motionless.—
The reduction of all qualities to quantities is nonsense: what
appears is that the one accompanies the other, an analogy—
565 (Fall 1886)
Qualities are insurmountable barriers for us; we cannot help
feeling that mere quantitative differences are something funda­
mentally distinct from quantity, namely that they are qualities
which can no longer be reduced to one another. But everything
for which the word “knowledge” makes any sense refers to the

quantity; while, on the other hand, all our sensations of value (i.e.,
simply our sensations) adhere precisely to qualities, i.e., to our
perspective “truths” which belong to us alone and can by no
means be “known”! It is obvious that every creature different from
us senses different qualities and consequently lives in a different
world from that in which we live. Qualities are an idiosyncrasy
peculiar to man; to demand that our human interpretations and
values should be universal and perhaps constitutive values is one
of the hereditary madnesses of human pride.

The “real world,” however one has hitherto conceived it—
it has always been the apparent world once again.30

The perspective therefore decides the character of the “appear­
ance”! As if a world would still remain over after one deducted
the perspective! By doing that one would deduct relativity!
Every center of force adopts a perspective toward the entire
remainder, i.e., its own particular valuation, mode of action, and
mode of resistance. The “apparent world,” therefore, is reduced
to a specific mode of action on the world, emanating from a center.
Now there is no other mode of action whatever; and the
“world” is only a word for the totality of these actions. Reality
consists precisely in this particular action and reaction of every
individual part toward the whole—
No shadow of a right remains to speak here of appearance—
The specific mode of reacting is the only mode of reacting;
we do not know how many and what kinds of other modes there
are.
But there is no “other,” no “true,” no essential being— for
this would be the expression of a world without action and re­

THE W IL L

TO P O W E R

The antithesis of the apparent world and the true world is
reduced to the antithesis “world” and “nothing.”—
568 (March-June 1888)
Critique of the concept "true and apparent world”— Of
these, the first is a mere fiction, constructed of fictitious entities.
“Appearance” itself belongs to reality: it is a form of its being;
i.e., in a world where there is no being* a certain calculable world
of identical cases must first be created through appearance: a
tempo at which observation and comparison are possible, etc.
Appearance is an arranged and simplified world, at which our
practical instincts have been at work; it is perfectly true for us;
that is to say, we live, we are able to live in it: proof of its truth for

us—
the world, apart from our condition of living in it, the world
that we have not reduced to our being, our logic and psychological
prejudices, does not exist as a world “in-itself”; it is essentially a
world of relationships; under certain conditions it has a differing
aspect from every point; its being is essentially different from every
point; it presses upon every point, every point resists it—and the
sum81 of these is in every case quite incongruent;
The measure of power determines what being possesses the
other measure of power; in what form, force, constraint it acts or
resists.
Our particular case is interesting enough: we have produced
a conception in order to be able to live in a world, in order to per­
ceive just enough to endure it—
569 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Our psychological perspective is determined by the following:
1.
that communication is necessary, and that for there to be
communication something has to be firm, simplified, capable of
precision (above all in the [so-called]32 identical case). For it
to be communicable, however, it must be experienced as adapted,
as “recognizable.” The material of the senses adapted by the
understanding, reduced to rough outlines, made similar, sub­

sumed under related matters. Thus the fuzziness and chaos of
sense impressions are, as it were, logicized;
2. the world of “phenomena” is the adapted world which we
feel to be real. The “reality” lies in the continual recurrence of
identical, familiar, related things in their logicized character, in the
belief that here we are able to reckon and calculate;
3. the antithesis of this phenomenal world is not “the true
world,” but the formless unformulable world of the chaos of sen­
sations— another kind of phenomenal world, a kind “unknowable”
for us;
4. questions, what things “in-themselves” may be like, apart
from our sense receptivity and the activity of our understanding,
must be rebutted with the question: how could we know that
things exist? “Thingness” was first created by us. The question is
whether there could not be many other ways of creating such an
apparent world— and whether this creating, logicizing, adapting,
falsifying is not itself the best-guaranteed reality; in short, whether
that which “posits things” is not the sole reality; and whether the
“effect of the external world upon us” is not also only the result
of such active subjects— The other “entities” act upon us; our
adapted apparent world is an adaptation and overpowering of their
actions; a kind of defensive measure. The subject alone is demon­
strable; hypothesis that only subjects exist— that “object” is only
a kind of effect produced by a subject upon a subject— a modus of
the subject.

10. Metaphysical Need
570 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
If one is a philosopher as men have always been philosophers,
one cannot see what has been and becomes— one sees only what
is. But since nothing is, all that was left to the philosopher as hit
“world” was the imaginary.
571 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
To assert the existence as a whole of things of which we know
nothing whatever, precisely because there is an advantage in not
being able to know anything of them, was a piece of naivete of
Kant, resulting from needs, mainly moral-metaphysical.

308

THE W ILL

TO P O W E R

572 ( 1883-1888)
An artist cannot endure reality, he looks away from it, back:
he seriously believes that the value of a thing resides in that
shadowy residue one derives from colors, form, sound, ideas', he
believes that the more subtilized, attenuated, transient a thing or
a man is, the more valuable he becomes; the less real, the more
valuable. This is Platonism, which, however, involved yet another
bold reversal: Plato measured the degree of reality by the degree
of value and said: The more “Idea,” the more being. He reversed
the concept “reality” and said: “What you take for real is an error,
and the nearer we approach the ‘Idea,’ the nearer we approach
‘truth.’ ”— Is this understood? It was the greatest of rebaptisms;
and because it has been adopted by Christianity we do not recognize
how astonishing it is. Fundamentally, Plato, as the artist he was,
preferred appearance to being! lie and invention to truth! the unreal
to the actual! But he was so convinced of the value of appearance
that he gave it the attributes “being,” “causality” and* “goodness,”
and “truth,” in short everything men value.
The concept of value itself considered as a cause: first insight.
The ideal granted all honorific attributes: second insight.
573 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
The idea of the “true world” or of “God” as absolutely im­
material, spiritual, good, is an emergency measure necessary while
the opposite instincts are still all-powerful—
The degree of moderation and humanity attained is exactly
reflected in the humanization of the gods: the Greeks of the
strongest epoch, who were not afraid of themselves but rejoiced
in themselves, brought their gods close to all their own affects— .
The spiritualization of the idea of God is therefore far from
being a sign of progress: one is heartily conscious of this when
considering Goethe— in his case, the vaporization of God into
virtue and spirit is felt as being on a coarser level—

Senselessness of all metaphysics as the derivation of the con­
ditioned from the unconditioned.

It is in the nature of thinking that it thinks of and invents the
unconditioned as an adjunct to the conditioned; just as it thought
of and invented the “ego” as an adjunct to the multiplicity of its
processes; it measures the world according to magnitudes posited by
itself— such fundamental fictions as “the unconditional,” “ends and
means,” “things,” “substances,” logical laws, numbers and forms.
There would be nothing that could be called knowledge if
thought did not first re-form the world in this way into “things,”
into what is self-identical. Only because there is thought is there
untruth.
Thought cannot be derived, any more than sensations can be;
but that does not mean that its primordiality or “being-in-itself” has
been proved! all that is established is that we cannot get beyond it,
because we have nothing but thought and sensation.
575 (1885-1836)
“Knowledge” is a referring back: in its essence a regressus in
infinitum. That which comes to a standstill (at a supposed causa
prima, at something unconditioned, etc.) is laziness* weariness------576 (1883-1888)
Psychology of metaphysics: the influence of timidity.
That which has been feared the most, the cause of the most
powerful suffering (lust to rule, sex, etc.),88 has been treated by
men with the greatest amount of hostility and eliminated from the
“true” world. Thus they have eliminated the affects one by one
—posited God as the antithesis of evil, that is, placed reality in
the negation of the desires and affects (i.e., in nothingness).
In the same way, they have hated the irrational, the arbitrary,
the accidental (as the causes of immeasurable physical suffering).
As a consequence, they negated this element in being-in-itself and
conceived it as absolute “rationality” and “purposiveness.”
In the same way, they have feared change, transitoriness:
this expresses a straitened soul, full of mistrust and evil experiences
(the case of Spinoza: an opposite kind of man would account
change a stimulus).

because Sophistry counted as the way to immorality);

things; consequently no “sin,” no evil, no imperfection

Epicurus denied the possibility of knowledge, in order to
retain moral (or hedonistic) values as the highest values.

being:— all false conclusions (blind trust in reason: if A exists,
then the opposite concept B must also exist). It is suffering that
inspires these conclusions: fundamentally they are desires that such
a world should exist; in the same way, to imagine another, more
valuable world is an expression of hatred for a world that makes
one suffer: the ressentiment of metaphysicians against actuality is
here creative.
Second series of questions: for what is there suffering?— and
from this a conclusion is derived concerning the relation of the
true world to our apparent, changing, suffering, contradictory
world: (1) Suffering as a consequence of error: how is error
possible? (2) Suffering as a consequence of guilt: how is guilt
possible? (— experiences derived from nature or society univers­
alized and projected to the sphere of “in-itself” ). If, however, the
conditioned world is causally conditioned by the unconditioned
world, then freedom to err and incur guilt must also be conditioned
by it: and again one asks, what for?— The world of appearance,
becoming, contradiction, suffering, is therefore willed: what fori
The error in these conclusions: two opposite concepts are
constructed— because one of them corresponds to a reality, the
other “must” also correspond to a reality. “ Whence should one
derive this opposite concept if this were not so?”— Reason is thus
a source of revelation concerning being-in-itself.
But the origin of these antitheses need not necessarily go back
to a supernatural source of reason: it is sufficient to oppose to it
the real genesis of the concepts. This derives from the practical
sphere, the sphere of utility; hence the strength of the faith it
inspires (one would perish if one did not reason according to this
mode of reason; but this is no “proof” of what it asserts).
The preoccupation with suffering on the part of metaphysi­
cians— is quite naive. “Eternal bliss” : psychological nonsense.
Brave and creative men never consider pleasure and pain as
ultimate values— they are epiphenomena: one must desire both if
one is to achieve anything— . That they see the problem of pleasure
and pain in the foreground reveals something weary and sick in
metaphysicians and religious people. Even morality is so important
to them only because they see in it an essential condition for the
abolition of suffering.
In the same way, their preoccupation with appearance and
error: cause of suffering, superstition that happiness attends truth
(confusion: happiness in “certainty,” in “faith” ).

To what extent the basic epistemological positions (material­
ism, idealism) are consequences of evaluations: the source of the
supreme feelings of pleasure (“feelings of value” ) as decisive also
for the problem of reality!
—The measure of positive knowledge is quite subsidiary or a
matter of indifference: as witness the development of India.
The Buddhistic negation of reality in general (appearance =
suffering) is perfectly consistent: undemonstrability, inaccessibility,
lack of categories not only for a ‘“world-in-itself,” but an insight
into the erroneous procedures by means of which this whole concept
is arrived at. “Absolute reality,” “being-in-itself” a contradiction.
In a world of becoming, “reality” is always only a simplification
for practical ends, or a deception through the coarseness of organs,
or a variation in the tempo of becoming.
Logical world-denial and nihilation35 follow from the fact
that we have to oppose non-being with being and that the concept
“becoming” is denied. ("Something” becomes.)

Being and becoming,— “Reason,” evolved on a sensualistic
basis, on the prejudices of the senses, i.e., in the belief in the truth
of the judgments of the senses.
“Being” as universalization of the concept “life” (breathing),
“having a soul,” “willing, effecting,” “becoming.”
The antithesis is: “not to have a soul,” “not to become,” “not
to will.” Therefore: “being” is not the antithesis of non-being,
appearance, nor even of the dead (for only something that can live
can be dead).
The “soul,” the “ego” posited as primeval fact, and introduced
everywhere where there is any becoming.

583 (March-June 1888)
(A )
I observe with astonishment that science has today resigned
itself to the apparent world; a real world— whatever it may be
like— we certainly have no organ for knowing it.
At this point we may ask: by means of what organ of
knowledge can we posit even this antithesis?—
That a world accessible to our organs is also understood to
be dependent upon these organs, that we understand a world as
being subjectively conditioned,86 is not to say that an objective
world is at all possible. Who compels us to think that subjectivity
is real, essential?
The “in-itself” is even an absurd conception; a “constitutioniii-itself” is nonsense; we possess the concept “being,” “thing,”
only as a relational concept—■
The worst thing is that with the old antithesis “apparent”
and “true” the correlative value judgment “lacking in value” and
“absolutely valuable” has developed.
The apparent world is not counted as a “valuable” world;
appearance is supposed to constitute an objection to supreme
value. Only a “true” world can be valuable in itself—
Prejudice of prejudices! Firstly, it would be possible that
the true constitution of things was so hostile to the presuppositions
of life, so opposed to them, that we needed appearance in order
to be able to live— After all, this is the case in so many situa­
tions; e.g., in marriage.
Our empirical world would be determined by the instincts
of self-preservation even as regards the limits of its knowledge:
we would regard as true, good, valuable that which serves the
preservation of the species—
a. We possess no categories by which we can distinguish a
true from an apparent world. (There might only be an apparent
world, but not our apparent world.)
b. Assuming the true world, it could still be a world less
valuable for us; precisely the quantum of illusion might be of
a higher rank on account of its value for our preservation. (Un­
less appearance as such were grounds for condemnation?)

uThe

reading o f “understand” and “conditioned” is uncertain.

314

c. That a correlation exists between degrees of value and
degrees of reality (so that the supreme values also possess the
supreme reality) is a metaphysical postulate proceeding from the
presupposition that we know the order of rank of values; namely,
that this order of rank is a moral order— Only with this pre­
supposition is truth necessarily part of the definition of all the
highest values.

(B)
It is of cardinal importance that one should abolish the true
world. It is the great inspirer of doubt and devaluator in respect
of the world we are: it has been our most dangerous attempt yet
to assassinate life.
War on all presuppositions on the basis of which one has
invented a true world* Among these is the presupposition that
moral values are the supreme values.
The supremacy of moral valuation would be refuted if it
could be shown to be the consequence of an immoral valuation
— as a special case of actual immorality— it would thus reduce
itself to an appearance, and as appearance it would cease to have
any right as such to condemn appearance.
(C)

The “will to truth” , would then have to be investigated psy­
chologically: it is not a moral force, but a form of the will to
power. This would have to be proved by showing that it employs
every immoral means: metaphysicians above all— .
We are today faced with testing the assertion that moral
values are the supreme values. Method in investigation is attained
only when all moral prejudices have been overcome:— it repre­
sents a victory over morality—
584 ( March-June 1888)
The aberration of philosophy is that, instead of seing in
logic and the categories of reason means toward the adjustment
of the world for utilitarian ends (basically, toward an expedient
falsification), one believed one possessed in them the criterion

book th re e :

Principles of A New Evaluation

315

of truth and reality. The “criterion of truth” was in fact merely
the biological utility of such a system of systematic falsification;
and since a species of animals knows of nothing more important
than its own preservation, one might indeed be permitted to speak
here of “truth.” The naivete was to take an anthropocentric
idiosyncrasy as the measure of things, as the rule37 for deter­
mining “real” and “unreal” : in short, lo make absolute some­
thing conditioned. And behold, suddenly the world fell apart
into a “true” world and an “apparent” world: and precisely the
world that man’s reason had devised for him to live and settle
in was discredited. Instead of employing the forms as a tool for
making the world manageable and calculable, the madness38 of
philosophers divined that in these categories is presented the
concept of that world to which the one in which man lives does
not correspond— The means were misunderstood as measures
of value, even as a condemnation of their real intention—
The intention was to deceive oneself in a useful way; the
means, the invention of formulas and signs by means of which
one could reduce the confusing multiplicity to a purposive and
manageable schema.
But alas! now a moral category was brought into play: no
creature wants to deceive itself, no creature may deceive— conse­
quently there is only a will to truth. What is “truth”?
The law of contradiction provided the schema: the true
world, to which one seeks the way, cannot contradict itself, can­
not change, cannot become, has no beginning and no end.
This is the greatest error that has ever been committed, the
essential fatality of error on earth: one believed one possessed a
criterion of reality in the forms of reason— while in fact one
possessed them in order to become master of reality, in order to
misunderstand reality in a shrewd manner—
And behold: now the world became false, and precisely on
account of the properties that constitute its reality: change, be­
coming, multiplicity, t opposition, contradiction, war. And then
the entire fatality was there:
1.
How can one get free from the false, merely apparent
world? (— it was the real, the only one);
" "Rule”: uncertain reading.
“ “Madness” : very doubtful conjecture; in the original, tw o illegible
words.

316

THE

TO P O W E R

2.
how can one become oneself as much as possible the
antithesis of the character of the apparent world? (Concept of
the perfect creature as an antithesis to the real creature; more
clearly, as the contradiction of life— )
The whole tendency of values was toward slander of life; one
created a confusion of idealist dogmatism and knowledge in gen­
eral: so that the opposing party also was always attacking science.
The road to science was in this way doubly blocked: once
by belief in the “true” world, and again by the opponents of
this belief. Natural science, psychology was (1) condemned with
regard to its objects, (2) deprived of its innocence—
In the actual world, in which everything is bound to and
conditioned by everything else, to condemn and think away any­
thing means to condemn and think away everything. The expres­
sion “that should not be,” “that should not have been,” is farcical—
If one thinks out the consequences, one would ruin the source
of life if one wanted to abolish whatever was in some respect
harmful or destructive. Physiology teaches us better!
— We see how morality (a) poisons the entire conception
of the world, (b) cuts off the road to knowledge, to science,
(c) disintegrates and undermines all actual instincts (in that it
teaches that their roots are immoral).
We see at work before us a dreadful tool of decadence that
props itself up by the holiest names and attitudes.

Man seeks “the truth” : a world that is not self-contradictory,
not deceptive, does not change, a true world— a world in which
one does not suffer; contradiction, deception, change— causes of
suffering! He does not doubt that a world as it ought to be
exists; he would like to seek out the road to it. (Indian critique:
even the “ego” as apparent, as not real.)
Whence does man here derive the concept reality?— Why

book th re e :

317

is it that he derives suffering from change, deception, contra­
diction? and why not rather his happiness?—
Contempt, hatred for all that perishes, changes, varies—
whence comes this valuation of that Which remains constant? Ob­
viously* the will to truth is here merely the desire for a world
of the constant.
The senses deceive, reason corrects the errors; consequently,
one concluded* reason is the road to the constant; the least sensual
ideas must be closest to the “true world.”— It is from the senses
that most misfortunes come— they are deceivers, deluders, de­
stroyers.—
Happiness can be guaranteed only by being; change and
happiness exclude one another. The highest desire therefore con­
templates unity with what has being. This is the formula for:
the road to the highest happiness.
In summa: the world as it ought to be exists; this world, in
which we live, is an error—-this world of ours ought not to exist.
Belief in what has being is only a consequence: the real
primum mobile is disbelief in becoming, mistrust of becoming,
the low valuation of all that becomes—
What kind of man reflects in this way? A n unproductive,
suffering kind, a kind weary of life. If we imagine the opposite
kind of man, he would not need to believe in what has being;
more, he would despise it as dead, tedious, indifferent—
The belief that the world as it ought to be is, really exists,
is a belief of the unproductive who do not desire to create a
world as it ought to be. They posit it as already available, they
seek ways and means of reaching it. “Will to truth”— as the
impotence of the will to create.

This same species of man, grown one stage poorer, no longer
possessing the strength to interpret, to create fictions, produces

nihilists. A nihilist is a
man who judges of the world asit is
that it ought not to be, and of the world as it ought to be that
it does not exist.39 According to this view, our existence (action,
suffering, willing, feeling) has no meaning: the pathos of “in
vain” is the nihilists’ pathos— at the same time, as pathos, an
inconsistency on the part of the nihilists.
Whoever is incapable of laying his will into things, lacking
will and strength, at least lays some meaning into them, i.e.,
the faith that there is a will in them already,40
It is a measure of the degree of strength of will to what
extent one can do without meaning in things, to what extent one
can endure to live in a meaningless world because one organizes
a small portion of it oneself.
The philosophical objective outlook can therefore be a sign
that will and strength are small For strength organizes what is
close and closest; “men of knowledge,” who desire only to ascer­
tain what is, are those who cannot fix anything as it ought to be.
Artists, an intermediary species: they at least fix an image
of that which ought to be; they are productive, to the extent that
they actually alter and transform; unlike men of knowledge, who
leave everything as it is,41
Connection between philosophers and the pessimistic reli­
gions: the same species of man (— they ascribe the highest degree
of reality to the most highly valued things— ).
Connection between philosophers and moral men and their
evaluations ( —the moral interpretation of the world as meaning:
after the decline of the religious meaning— ).

Overcoming of philosophers through the destruction of the
world of being: intermediary period of nihilism: before there is
yet present the strength to reverse values and to deify becoming
and the apparent world as the only world, and to call them good.

(B )
Nihilism as a normal phenomenon can be a symptom of in­
creasing strength or of increasing weakness:
partly, because the strength to create, to will, has so increased
that it no longer requires these total interpretations and intro­
ductions of meaning ( “present tasks,” the state, etc.);
partly because even the creative strength to create meaning
has declined and disappointment becomes the dominant condi­
tion. The incapability of believing in a “meaning,” “unbelief.”
What does science mean in regard to both possibilities?
1. As a sign of strength and self-control, as being able to
do without healing, comforting worlds of illusion;
2. as undermining, dissecting, disappointing, weakening.

Belief in truth, the need to have a hold on something believed
true, psychological reduction apart from all previous value feel­
ings. Fear, laziness.
The same way, unbelief: reduction. To what extent it
acquires a new value if a true world does not exist (—thus
the value feelings that hitherto have been squandered on the
world of being, are again set free).

The “True” and the “Apparent World”
(A )

The seductions that proceed from this concept are of three
kinds:
a.
an unknown world:— we are adventurers, inquisitive—•
that which is known seems to weary us (— the danger of this
concept lies in its insinuation that “ this” world is known to us— );

320

THE

WILL

TO P O W E R

b. another world, where things are different; something in us
calculates, our still submission, our silence, lose their value—
perhaps everything will turn out well, we have not hoped in vain
— the world where things are different, where we ourselves—
who knows?— are different—
c. a true world: this is the most amazing trick and attack
that has ever been perpetrated upon us; so much has become
encrusted in the word “true,” and involuntarily we make a
present of all this to the “true woild” : the true world must also
be a truthful world, one that does not deceive us, does not make
fools of us: to believe in it is virtually to be compelled to believe
in it (— out of decency, as is the case among people worthy
of confidence— ).
*

The concept “the unknown world” insinuates that this world
is “known” to us (is tedious— );
the concept “another world” insinuates that the world could
be otherwise— abolishes necessity and fate (useless to submit one­
self— to adapt oneself— );
the concept “the true world” insinuates that this world is
untruthful, deceptive, dishonest, inauthentic, inessential—and con­
sequently also not a world adapted to our needs (— inadvisable
to adapt oneself to it; better to resist it).
*
We therefore elude “this” world in three ways:
a. by our inquisitiveness— as if the more interesting part
were elsewhere;
b. by our submission— as though it were not necessary to
submit oneself— as if this world were not a necessity of the ulti­
mate rank:
c. by our sympathy and respect— as if this world did not
deserve them, were impure, were not honest with us—
In summa: we have revolted in three ways: we have made
an “x ” into a critique of the “known world.”
( B )

First step toward sobriety: to grasp to what extent we have
been seduced—for things could be exactly the reverse:

book th re e :

321

a. the unknown world could be a stupid and meaner form of
existence— and “this” world might be rather enjoyable by com­
parison;
b. the other world, far from taking account of our desires
which would find no fulfillment in it, could be among the mass
of things that make this world possible for us: to get to know
it might be a means of making us contented;
c. the true world: but who is it really who tells us that the
apparent world must be of less value than the true one? Does
our instinct not contradict this judgment? Does man not eternally
create a fictitious world for himself because he wants a better
world than reality? Above all: how do we arrive at the idea that
our world is not the true world?— it could be that the other
world is the “apparent” one (in fact the Greeks thought of, e.g., a
shadow kingdom, an apparent existence, beside true existence).
And finally: what gives us the right to posit, as it were, degrees
of reality? This is something different from an unknown world—
it is already a wanting to know something of the unknown—
The “other,” the “unknown” world— very good! But to say “true
world” means “to know something of it”— That is the opposite
of the assumption of an “x" world—
In summa: the world “x” could be in every sense more tedious,
less human, and less worthy than this world.
It would be another thing to assert the existence of “x ”
worlds, i.e., of every possible world besides this one. But this
has never been asserted—
(C )
Problem: why the notion of another world has always been
unfavorable for, or critical of “this” world— what does this indi­
cate?—
For a people proud of itself, whose life is ascending, always
thinks of another kind of being as a lower, less valuable kind
of being; it regards the strange, the unknown world as its enemy,
as its opposite; it feels no inquisitiveness, it totally rejects the
strange— A people would never admit that another people was
the “true people.”—
It is symptomatic that such a distinction should be at all
possible— that one takes this world for the “apparent” one and
the other world as “true.”

322

THE W IL L

TO P O W E R

The places of origin of the notion of “another world” :
the philosopher, who invents a world of reason, where
reason and the logical functions are adequate: this is
the origin of the “true” world;
the religious man, who invents a “divine world” : this is
the origin of the “denaturalized, anti-natural” world;
the moral man, who invents a “free world” : this is the
origin of the “good, perfect, just, holy” world.
What the three places of origin have in common: the psycho­
logical blunder, the physiological confusions.
By what attributes is the “other world,” as it actually appears
in history, distinguished? By the stigmata of philosophical, reli­
gious, moral prejudice.
The “other world,” as illumined by these facts, as a synonym
for nonbeing, nonliving, not wanting to live—
General insight: it is the instinct of life-weariness, and not
that of life, which has created the “other world.”
Consequence: philosophy, religion, and morality are symp­
toms of decadence.*2

11. Biological Value of Knowledge
587 (1885-1886)
It lmight seem as though I had evaded the question of “cer­
tainty.” The opposite is true; but by inquiring after the criterion
of certainty I tested the scales upon which men have weighed
in general hitherto— and that the question of certainty itself is a
dependent question, a question of the second rank.
588 (1883-1886)
The question of values is more fundamental than the ques­
tion of certainty: the latter becomes serious only by presupposing
that the value question has already been answered.
“ In the MS an earlier version o f Twilight, C h ap ter III, section 6, follows
at this point. All o f the sections dealing w ith the contrast o f the “true” and
the “apparent” world should be considered as background m aterial fo r Twi­

Being and appearance, psychologically considered, yield no
“being-in-itself,” no criterion of “reality,” but only for grades
of appearance measured by the strength of the interest we show
in an appearance.
There is no struggle for existence between ideas and per­
ceptions, but a struggle for dominion: the idea that is overcome
is not annihilated, only driven back or subordinated. There is
no annihilation in the sphere of spirit— 43

Our values are interpreted into things.
Is there then any meaning in the in-itself? !
Is meaning not necessarily relative meaning and perspective?
All meaning is will to power (all relative meaning resolves
itself into it) .

The desire for “solid facts”—epistemology: how much pes­
simism there is in it!
592 (1883-1888)
The antagonism between the “true world,” as revealed by
pessimism, and a world possible for life—here one must test the
rights of truth. It is necessary to measure the meaning of all these
“ideal drives” against life to grasp what this antagonism really is:
the struggle of sickly, despairing life that cleaves to a beyond, with
healthier, more stupid and mendacious, richer, less degenerate life.
Therefore it is not “truth” in struggle with life but one kind of life

To transform the belief “it is thus and thus” into the will “it
shall become thus and thus.”

12. Science
594 ( 1883-1888)
Science— this has been hitherto a way of putting an end to
the complete confusion in which things exist, by hypotheses that
“explain” everything—so it has come from the intellect’s dislike
of chaos.— This same dislike seizes me when I consider myself:
I should like to form an image of the inner world, too, by means
of some schema, and thus triumph over intellectual confusion.
Morality has been a simplification of this kind: it taught that men
were known, familiar.— Now we have destroyed morality— we
have again become completely obscure to ourselves! I know that
I know nothing of myself. Physics proves to be a boon for the
heart: science (as the way to knowledge) acquires a new charm
after morality has been eliminated— and because it is here alone
that we find consistency, we have to construct our life so as to
preserve it. This yields a sort of practical reflection on the con­
ditions of our existence as men of knowledge.
595 (1884)
Our presuppositions: no God: no purpose: finite force. Let
us guard against thinking out and prescribing the mode of thought
necessary to lesser men! !

schooling in [scientific]4* errors is needed, because "truth” dis“ The word I have placed in brackets was added by the German editors.

gusts and makes one sick of life—unless man is already irrevocably
launched upon his path and has taken his honest insight upon him­
self with a tragic pride.
597 (1886-1887)
The presupposition of scientific work: belief in the unity and
perpetuity of scientific work, so the individual may work at any
part, however small, confident that his work will not be in vain.
There is one great paralysis: to work in vain, to struggle in
vain.-----*
The accumulative epochs, in which force and means of power
are discovered that the future will one day make use of; science
an intermediary station, at which the more intermediary, more
multifarious, more complicated natures find their most natural dis­
charge and satisfaction— all those who should avoid action.
598 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
A philosopher recuperates differently and with different
means: he recuperates, e.g., with nihilism. Belief that there is no
truth at all, the nihilistic belief, is a great relaxation for one who,
as a warrior of knowledge, is ceaselessly fighting ugly truths. For
truth is ugly.45
599 (1885-1886)
The “meaninglessness of events” : belief in this is the conse­
quence of an insight into the falsity of previous interpretations, a
generalization of discouragement and weakness— not a necessary
belief.
The immodesty of man: to deny meaning where he sees none.
45Another version, written a few months later, is printed in 1911, p.
508: “For a warrior of knowledge, who is always fighting ugly truths, the
belief that there is no truth at all is a great bath and relaxation.— Nihilism
is our kind of leisure.”
Cf. the chapter “On War and Warriors” in Zarathustra, I (Portable
Nietzsche, p. 158 ff). And note the deliberate antithesis, especially of the
formulation in the text, to the romantic identification of truth and beauty.

No limit to the ways in which the world can be interpreted;
every interpretation a symptom of growth or of decline.
Inertia needs unity (monism); plurality of interpretations a
sign of strength. Not to desire to deprive the world of its disturbing

attempt at monism belongs here.

This perspective world, this world for the eye, tongue, and
ear, is very false, even if compared for47 a very much more subtle
sense-apparatus. But its intelligibility, comprehensibility, practica­
bility, and beauty begin to cease if we refine our senses; just as
beauty ceases when we think about historical processes; the order
of purpose is already an illusion. It suffices that the more super­
ficially and coarsely it is conceived, the more valuable, definite,
beautiful, and significant the world appears. The deeper one looks,
the more our valuations disappear— meaninglessness approaches!
We have created the world that possesses values! Knowing this, we
know, too, that reverence for truth is already the consequence of
an illusion— and that one should value more than truth the force
that forms, simplifies, shapes, invents.
“Everything is false! Everything is permitted!”
Only with a certain obtuseness of vision, a will to simplicity,
does the beautiful, the “valuable” appear: in itself, it is I know
not what.

Zarathustra.

“Interpretation,” the introduction of meaning— not “explana­
tion” (in most cases a new interpretation over an old interpretation
that has become incomprehensible, that is now itself only a sign).
There are no facts, everything is in flux, incomprehensible, elusive;
what is relatively most enduring is— our opinions.
605 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The ascertaining of “truth” and “untruth,” the ascertaining
of facts in general, is fundamentally different from creative posit­
ing, from forming, shaping, overcoming, willing, such as is of the
essence of philosophy. To introduce a meaning— this task still re­
mains to be done, assuming there is no meaning yet. Thus it is
with sounds, but also with the fate of peoples: they are capable
of the most different interpretations and direction toward different
goals.
On a yet higher level is to posit a goal and mold facts accord­
ing to it; that is, active interpretation and not merely conceptual
translation,
606 (1885-1886)
Ultimately, man finds in things nothing but what he himself
has imported into them: the finding is called science, the importing
— art, religion, love, pride. Even if this should be a piece of child­
ishness, one should carry on with both and be well disposed toward
both— some should find; others— we others!— should import!

Science: its two sides:
in regard to the individual;
in regard tp the cultural complex (level);
—valuations from one side or the other are mutually antagonistic.
608 ( 1886-1887)
The development of science resolves the “familiar” more
and more into the unfamiliar:— it desires, however, the reverse,
and proceeds from the instinct to trace the unfamiliar back to the
familiar.
In summa, science is preparing a sovereign ignorance, a feel­
ing that there is no such thing as “knowing,” that it was a kind
of arrogance to dream of it, more, that we no longer have the
least notion that warrants our considering “knowledge” even a pos­
sibility—that “knowing” itself is a contradictory idea. We translate
a primeval mythology and vanity of mankind into the hard fact:
“knowledge-in-itself” is as impermissible a concept as is “thing-initself.” Seduction by “number and logic,” seduction by “laws.”
“Wisdom” as the attempt to get beyond perspective valuations
(i.e., beyond the “will to power” ): a principle hostile to life and
decadent, a symptom as among the Indians, etc., of the weakening
of the power of appropriation.
609 (1884)
It is not enough that you understand in what ignorance man
and beast live; you must also have and acquire the will to ignor­
ance. You need to grasp that without this kind of ignorance life
itself would be impossible, that it is a condition under which alone
the living thing can preserve itself and prosper: a great, firm dome
of ignorance must encompass you.
610 (1884)
Science— the transformation of nature into concepts for the
purpose of mastering nature— belongs under the rubric “means.”

But the purpose and will of man must grow in the same way,
the intention in regard to the whole.
611 ( 1883-1888)
We find that the strongest and most constantly employed
faculty at all stages of life is thought-—even in every act of per­
ceiving and apparent passivity! Evidently, it thus becomes most
powerful and demanding, and in the long run it tyrannizes over all
other forces. Finally it becomes “passion-in-itself.”

To win back for the man of knowledge the right to great
affects! after self-effacement and the Cult Of “objectivity” have
created a false order of rank in this sphere, tod. Error reached its
peak when Schopenhauer taught: the only way to the “true,” to
knowledge, lies precisely in getting free from affects, from will;
the intellect liberated from will cannot but see the true, real es­
sence of things.
The same error in arie:so as if everything were beautiful as
soon as it is viewed without will.

That the value of the world lies in our interpretation (— that
other interpretations than merely human ones are perhaps some­

tive valuations by virtue of which we can survive in life, i.e., in
the will to power, for the growth of power; that every elevation of
man brings with it the overcoming of narrower interpretations;
that every strengthening and increase of power opens up new per­
spectives and means believing in new horizons— this idea perme­
ates my writings. The world with which we are concerned is false,
i.e., is not a fact but a fable and approximation on the basis of
a meager sum of observations; it is “in flux,” as something in a
state of becoming, as a falsehood always changing but never getting
near the truth: for— there is no “truth.”
617 (1883-1885)^
To impose upon becoming the character of being— that is the
supreme will to power.
Twofold falsification, on the part of the senses and of the
spirit, to preserve a world of that which is, which abides, Which
is equivalent, etc.
That everything recurs82 is the closest approximation of a
world of becoming to a world of being:— high point of the medita­

of and discontent with becoming, after such a world of being had
first been invented.

Becoming as invention, willing, self-denial, overcoming of
oneself: no subject but an action, a positing, creative, no “causes

Art as the will to overcome becoming, as “etemalization,”
but shortsighted, depending on the perspective: repeating in minia­

Regarding that which all life reveals as a diminutive formula

Instead of “cause and effect” the mutual struggle of that

number of becoming elements not constant.
Uselessness of old ideals for the interpretation of the totality
of events, once one knows the animal origin and utility of these
ideals; all, moreover, contradictory to life.
Uselessness of the mechanistic theory— it gives the impres­
sion of meaninglessness.
The entire idealism of mankind hitherto is on the point of
changing suddenly into nihilism— into the belief in absolute worth­
lessness, i.e., meaninglessness.
The destruction of ideals, the new desert; new arts by means
of which we can endure it, we amphibians.
Presupposition: bravery, patience, no “turning back,” no
haste to go forward. (N.B. Zarathustra adopts a parodistic atti­
tude toward all former values as a consequence of his abundance.)

IN NATURE”
1. The Mechanistic Interpretation
of the World5*
618 (1885)
Of all the interpretations of the world attempted hitherto, the
mechanistic one seems today to stand victorious in the foreground.
It evidently has a good conscience on its side; and no science
believes it can achieve progress and success except with the aid
of mechanistic procedures. Everyone knows these procedures:
one leaves “reason” and “purpose” out of account as far as possible,
one shows that, given sufficient time, anything can evolve out of
anything else, and one does not conceal a malicious chuckle when
“apparent intention” in the fate of a plant or an egg yolk is once
again traced back to pressure and stress: in short, one pays heart­
felt homage to the principle of the greatest possible stupidity, if
a playful expression may be allowed concerning such serious
matters. Meanwhile, a presentiment, or anxiety, is to be noted
among select spirits involved in this movement, as if the theory had
a hole in it that might sooner or later prove to be its final hole:
I mean the shrill ohe through which one whistles in an extreme
emergency.68 One cannot “explain” pressure and stress themselves,
one cannot get free of the actio in distorts:™— one has lost the
belief in being able to explain at all, and admits with a wry ex­
pression that description and not explanation is all that is possible,
that the dynamic interpretation of the world, with its denial of
“empty space” and its little clumps of atoms, will shortly come
to dominate physicists; though an inner quality in dynamis-----619 (1885)

physicists have created God and the world, still needs to be com­
pleted: an inner will must be ascribed to it, which I designate as
“will to power,” i.e., as an insatiable desire to manifest power;
or as the employment and exercise of power, as a creative drive,
etc. Physicists cannot eradicate “action at a distance” from their
principles; nor can they eradicate a repellent force (or an attracting
one). There is nothing for it: one is obliged to understand all
motion, all “appearances,” all “laws,” only as symptoms of an
inner event and to employ man as an analogy to this end. In the
case of an animal, it is possible to trace all its drives to the will
to power; likewise all the functions of organic life to this one
source.
620 ( 1885-1886)
Has a force ever been demonstrated? No, only effects trans­
lated into a completely foreign language. We are so used, how­
ever, to regularity in succession that its oddity no longer seems odd
to us.
621 (1885-1886)
A force we cannot imagine is an empty word and should be
allowed no rights of citizenship in science; like the so-called purely
mechanistic forces of attraction and repulsion, which are intended
to make it possible for us to form an image of the world, no more!
622 ( 1885-1886)
Pressure and stress, something unspeakably late, derivative,
un-primeval. For they presuppose something that holds together
and is able to exert pressure and stress! But how can it hold
together?
623 (March-June 1888)
There is nothing unchanging in chemistry: this is only appear­
ance, a mere school prejudice. We have slipped in the unchanging,
my physicist friends, deriving it from metaphysics as always. To
assert that diamond, graphite, and carbon are identical is to read
off the facts naively from the surface. Why? Merely because no

loss in substance can be shown on the scales! Very well, they have
something in common; but the activity of molecules during the
transformation, which we cannot see or weigh, turns one material
into something different—with specifically different properties.
624 (1883-1888)
Against the physical atom.— To comprehend the world, we
have to be able to calculate it; to be able to calculate it, we have
to have constant causes; because we find no such constant causes
in actuality, we invent them for ourselves— the atoms. This is the
origin of atomism.
The calculability of the world, the expressibility of all events
in formulas— is this really ‘-comprehension”? How much of a piece
of music has been understood when that in it which is calculable
and can be reduced to formulas has been reckoned up?— And
“constant causes,” things, substances, something “unconditioned”;
invented—what has one achieved?
625 (March-June 1888)
The mechanistic concept of “motion” is already a translation
of the original process into the sign language of sight and touch.
The concept “atom,” the distinction between the “‘seat of
a driving force and the force itself,” is a sign language derived
from our logical-psychical world.
We cannot change our means of expression at will: it is
possible to understand to what extent they are mere signs. The
demand for an adequate mode of expression is senseless: it is of
the essence of a language, a means of expression, to express a
mere relationship—
The concept “truth” is nonsensical. The entire domain of
“true-false” applies only to relations, not to an “in-itself”— There
is no “essence-in-itself” (it is only relations that constitute an
essence— ), just as there can be no “knowledge-in-itself.”
626 (1883-1886)
“The sensation of force cannot proceed from motion: sen­
sation in general cannot proceed from motion.”

book th re e :

“It is only an apparent experience that speaks in favor of this:
in a substance (brain), sensations are produced by transmitted
motion (stimuli). But produced? Would this prove that the sen­
sation did not exist there at all? so that its appearance would have
to be conceived as a creative act on the part of the motion? The
sensationless state of this substance is only a hypothesis! it is not
experienced!— Sensation is thus a property of substance: there
are substances that have sensations.”
“Do we discover from certain substances that they have no
sensations? No, we only fail to discover that they have any. It is
impossible to derive sensation from a substance without sens­
ation.”— Oh what overhastiness!
627 ( 1885-1886)
“Attraction” and “repulsion” in a purely mechanistic sense
are complete fictions: a word. We cannot think of an attraction
divorced from an i n t e n t i o n The will to take possession of a
thing or to defend oneself against it and repel it— that, we “under­
stand” : that would be an interpretation of which we could make
use.
In short: the psychological necessity for a belief in causality
lies in the inconceivability of an event divorced from intent; by
which naturally nothing is said concerning truth or untruth (the
justification of such a belief)! The belief in causae67 falls with the
belief in tele158 (against Spinoza and his causalism).
628 ( 1885-1886)
It is an illusion that something is known when we possess a
mathematical formula for an event: it is only designated, described;
nothing more!
629 (1883-1888)
If I reduce a regular event to a formula, I have foreshortened,
facilitated, etc., the description of the whole phenomenon. But I

happens that something here repeats itself: that the formula cor­
responds to a complex of initially unknown forces and discharges
of force, is a supposition; it is mythology to think that forces here
obey a law, so that;! as a consequence of their obedience, we have
the same phenomenon each time.
630 (1885)
I beware of speaking of chemical “laws” : that savors of
morality. It is far rather a question of the absolute establishment
of power relationships: the stronger becomes master of the weaker,
in so far as the latter cannot assert its degree of independence—
here there is no mercy, no forbearance, even less a respect for
“laws”!
631 (1885-1886)
The unalterable sequence of certain phenomena demonstrates
no “law” but a power relationship between two or more forces.
To say “But this relationship itself remains constant” is to say no
more than “One and the same force cannot also be another
force.”— It is a question* not of succession, but of interpenetration,
a process in which the individual successive moments are not
related to one another as cause and effect—
The separation of the “deed” from the “doer,” of the event
from someone who produces events, of the process from: a some­
thing that is not process but enduring, substance, thing, body,
soul, etc.— the attempt to comprehend an event as a sort of shifting
and place-changing on the part of a “being,” of something con­
stant: this ancient mythology established the belief in “cause and
effect” after it had found a firm form in the functions of language
and grammar.
632 (1885-1886)
“Regularity” in succession is only a metaphorical expression,
as if a rule were being followed here; not a fact. In the same way
“conformity with a law.” We discover a formula by which to ex­
press an ever-recurring kind of result: we have therewith dis­
covered no “law,” even less a force that is the cause of the recur­
rence of a succession of results. That something always happens

thus and thus is here interpreted as if a creature always acted thus
and thus as a result of obedience to a law or a lawgiver, while it
woUId be free to act otherwise were it not for the “law.” But
precisely this thus-and-not-otherwise might be inherent in the
creature, which might behave thus and thus, not in response to a
law* but because it is constituted thus and thus. All it would mean
is: something cannot also be something else, cannot do now this
and now something else, is neither free nor unfree but simply thus
and thus. The mistake lies in the fictitious insertion of a subject.
633 (March-June 1888)
Two successive states, the one “cause,” the other “effect” :
this is false. The first has nothing to effect* the second has been
effected by nothing.
It is a question of a struggle between two elements of unequal
power: a new arrangement of forces is achieved according to the
measure of power of each of them. The second condition is some­
thing fundamentally different from the first (not its effect): the
essential thing is that the factions in struggle emerge with different
quanta of power.
634 (March-June 1888)
Critique of the mechanistic theory.— Let us here dismiss the
two popular concepts “necessity” and “law” : the former intro­
duces a false constraint into the world, the latter a false freedom.
“Things” do not behave regularly, according to a rule: there are
no things (— they are fictions invented by us); they behave just
as little under the constraint of necessity. There is no obedience
here: for that something is as it is, as strong or as weak, is not
the consequence of an obedience or a rule or a compulsion—
The degree of resistance and the degree of superior power—
this is the question in every event: if, for our day-to-day cal­
culations, we know how to express this in formulas and “laws,”
so much the better for usl But we have not introduced any
“morality” into the world by the fiction that it is obedient— .
There is no law: every power draws its ultimate consequence
at every moment. Calculability exists precisely because things are
unable to be other than they are.
A quantum of power is designated by the effect it produces

338

THE

and that which it resists. The adiaphorous state is missing, though
it is thinkable. It is essentially a will to violate and to defend one­
self against violation. Not self-preservation: every atom affects
the whole of being—it is thought away if one thinks away this
radiation of power-wili. That is why I call it a quantum of “will
to power” : it expresses the characteristic that cannot be thought
out of the mechanistic order without thinking away this order itself.
A translation of this world of effect into a visible world— a
world for the eyes—is the conception “motion.” This always carries
the idea that something is moved— this always supposes, whether
as the fiction of a little clump of atom or even as the abstraction of
this, the dynamic atom, a thing that produces effects— i.e., we have
not got away from the habit into which our senses and language
seduce us. Subject, object, a doer added to the doing, the doing sep­
arated from that which it does: let us not forget that this is mere
semeiotics and nothing real. Mechanistic theory as a theory of mo­
tion is already a translation into the sense language of man.80
635 (March-June 1888)
We need “unities” in order to be able to reckon: that does
not mean we must suppose that such unities exist. We have
borrowed the concept of unity from our “ego” concept— our
oldest article of faith. If we did not hold ourselves to be unities,
we would never have formed the concept “thing.” Now, somewhat
late, we are firmly convinced that our conception of the ego does
not guarantee any actual unity. In order to sustain the theory of
a mechanistic world, therefore, we always have to stipulate to what
extent we are employing two fictions: the concept of motion
(taken from our sense language) and the concept of the atom
( = unity, deriving from our psychical “experience” ) : the mecha­
nistic theory presupposes a sense prejudice and a psychological
prejudice.
Mechanistic theory formulates consecutive appearances, and
it does so semeiotically, in terms of the senses and of psychology
(that all effect is motion; that where there is motion something is
m oved); it does not touch upon the causal force.

German editors divided this notebook entry into two sections.

The mechanistic world is imagined as only sight and touch
imagine a world (as “moved”)-—so as to be calculable— thus
causal unities are invented, “things” (atoms) whose effect remains
constant (— transference of the false concept of subject to the con­
cept of the atom ).
The following are therefore phenomenal: the injection of the
concept of number, the concept of the thing (concept of the sub­
ject), the concept of activity (separation of cause from effect), the
concept of motion (sight and touch): our eye and our psychology
are still part of it.
If we eliminate these additions, no things remain but only
dynamic quanta, in a relation of tension to all other dynamic
quanta: their essence lies in their relation to all other quanta, in
their “effect” upon the same. The will to power not a being, not
a becoming, but a pathos60— the most elemental fact from which a
becoming and effecting first emerge—
636 (March-June 1888)
Physicists believe in a “true world” in their own fashion: a
firm systematization of atoms in necessary motion, the same for all
beings-—so for them the “apparent world” is reduced to the side
of universal and universally necessary being which is accessible to
every being in its own way (accessible and also already adapted—
made “subjective” ). But they are in error. The atom they posit is
inferred according to the logic of the perspectivism of conscious­
ness— and is therefore itself a subjective fiction. This world picture
that they sketch differs in no essential way from the subjective
world picture: it is only construed with more extended senses, but
with our senses nonetheless— And in any case they left something
out of the constellation without knowing it: precisely this necessary
perspectivism by virtue of which every center of force— and not
only man— construes all the rest of the world from its own view­
point, i.e., measures, feels, forms, according to its own force—
They forgot to include this perspective-setting force in “true being”
— in school language: the subject. They think this is “evolved,”
added later; but even the chemist needs it: it is being specific,
60Occasion, event, passion, suffering, destiny are among the meanings
of this Greek word. A comparison of the sections in this part with White­
head’s philosophy of occasions and events would be fruitful.

definitely acting and reacting thus and thus, as may be the case.
Perspectivism is only a complex form of specificity. My idea
is that every specific body strives to become master over all space
and to extend its force (— its will to power:) and to thrust back
all that resists its extension. But it continually encounters similar
efforts on the part of other bodies and ends by coming to an
arrangement (“union” ) with those of them that are sufficiently
related to it: thus they then conspire together for power. And the
process goes on—
637 (1885)
Even in the domain of the inorganic an atom of force is con­
cerned only with its neighborhood: distant forces balance one an­
other. Here is the kernel of the perspective view and why a living
creature is “egoistic” through and through.

The sole way of maintaining a meaning for the concept “God”
would be: God not as the driving force, but God as a maximal
state, as an epoch— a point in the evolution of the will to power
by means of which further evolution just as much as previous evo­
lution up to him could be explained.
Regarded mechanistically, the energy of the totality of becom­
ing remains constant; regarded economically, it rises to a high
point and sinks down again in an eternal circle. This “will to
power” expresses itself in the interpretation, in the manner in
which force is used up; transformation of energy into life, and
“life at its highest potency,” thus appears as the goal. The same
quantum of energy means different things at different stages of
evolution.

That which constitutes growth in life is an ever more thrifty
and more far-seeing economy, which achieves more and more with
less and less force— As an ideal, the principle of the smallest ex­
penditure—
That the world is not striving toward a stable condition is
the only thing that has been proved. Consequently one must con­
ceive its climactic condition in such a way that it is not a condition
of equilibrium—
The absolute necessity of similar events occurring in the
course of one world, as in all others, is in eternity not a determin­
ism ruling events, but merely the expression of the fact that the
impossible is not possible; that a certain force cannot be anything
other than this certain force; that it can react to a quantum of
resisting force only according to the measure of its strength;—
event and necessary event is a tautology.

2. The Will to Power as Life

A. The Organic Process
640 (1883-1888)
Man thinks of himself as having been present when the organic
world originated: what was there to be perceived by sight and
touch when this event took place? What can be reduced to figures?
What laws are revealed in the motions? Thus: man wants to ar­
range all events as events accessible to sight and touch, conse­
quently as motions: he wants to find formulas so as to simplify
the tremendous quantity of his experiences. Reduction of all events
to the level of the man of the senses and the mathematician. It is
a question of an inventory of human experiences— under the sup­
position that man, or rather the human eye and ability to form
concepts, are the eternal witness of all things.
641 ( 1883-1888)
A multiplicity of forces, connected by a common mode of
nutrition, we call “life.” To this mode of nutrition, as a means of

342

THE

WILL

TO P O W E R

making it possible, belong all so-called feelings, ideas, thoughts;
i.e,, (1) a resistance to all other forces; (2 ) an adjustment of the
same according to form and rhythm; (3) an estimate in regard to
assimilation or excretion.
642 (1885)
The connection between the inorganic and the organic must
lie in the repelling force exercised by every atom of force. “Life”
would be defined as an enduring form of processes of the establish­
ment of forcej in which the different contenders grow unequally.
To what extent resistance is present even in obedience; individual
power is by no means surrendered. In the same way, there is in
commanding an admission that the absolute power of the opponent
has not been vanquished, incorporated, disintegrated. “Obedience”
and “commanding” are forms of struggle.
643 (1885-1886)
The will to power interprets (— it is a question of interpreta­
tion when an org&n is Constructed): it defines limits, determines
degrees, variations of power. Mere variations of power could not
feel themselves to be such: there must be present something that
wants to grow and interprets the value of whatever else wants to
grow. Equal in that— In fact, interpretation is itself a means of
becoming master of something. (The organic process constantly
presupposes interpretations,)
644 (1883-1888)
Greater complexity, sharp differentiation, the contiguity of
developed organs and functions with the disappearance of the inter­
mediate members— if that is perfection, then there is a will to
power in the organic process by virtue of which dominant, shaping,
commanding forces continually extend the bounds of their power
and continually simplify within these bounds: the imperative grows.
“Spirit” is only a means and tool in the service of higher life,
of the enhancement of life; and as for the good, as Plato (and after
him Christianity) understood it, it seems to me to be actually a
life-endangering, life-calumniating, life-denying principle.

645 (7555)
That “heredity,” as something quite unexplained, cannot be
employed as an explanation but only to describe and fix a problem.
The same applies to “power of adaptation.” Indeed, the morpho­
logical presentation, even if it were complete, explains nothing,
but only describes a tremendous fact How an organ can be em­
ployed to achieve something is not explained. In these matters,
the assumption of causae finales explains as little as the assumption
of causae efficientes. The concept of “causa” is only a means of
expression, nothing more; a means of description,
646 (1885)
There are analogies; e.g., a memory analogous to our memory
that reveals itself in heredity and evolution and forms. An in­
ventiveness in the application of tools to new ends analogous to
our inventiveness and experimentation* etc.
That which we call our “consciousness” is innocent of any
of the essential processes of our preservation and our growth;
and no head is so subtle that it could construe more than a machine
—to which every organic process is far superior.
647 (1883-1888)
Against Darwinism*1— The utility of an organ does not
explain its origin; on the contrary! For most of the time during
which a property is forming it does not preserve the individual and
is of no use to him, least of all in the struggle with external circum­
stances and enemies.
What, after all, is “useful”? One must ask “useful in relation
to what?” E.g., that which is useful for the long life of the indi­
vidual might be unfavorable to its strength and splendor; that which
preserves the individual might at the same time arrest and halt
its evolution. On the other hand, a deficiency, a degeneration, can
be of the highest utility in so far as it acts as a stimulant to other
organs. In the same way, a state of need can be a condition of
existence, in so far as it reduces an individual to that measure of

expenditure which holds it together but prevents it from squander­
ing itself.— The individual itself as a struggle between parts (for
food, space, e tc .): its evolution tied to the victory or predominance
of individual parts, to an atrophy, a “becoming an organ” of
other parts.
The influence of “external circumstances" is overestimated by
Darwin to a ridiculous extent: the essential thing in the life process
is precisely the tremendous shapings form-creating force working
from within which utilizes and exploits “external circumstances” —
The new forms molded from within are not formed with an end
in view; but in the struggle of the parts a new form is not left long
without being related to a partial usefulness and then, according
to its use, develops itself more and more completely.62
648 (1883-1888)
“Useful” in respect of acceleration of the tempo of evolution
is a different kind of “useful” from that in respect of the greatest
possible stability and durability of that Which is evolved.
649 (1883-1888)
“Useful” in the sense of Darwinist biology means: proved
advantageous in the struggle with others. But it seems to me that
the feeling of increase, the feeling of becoming stronger, is itself,
quite apart from any usefulness in the struggle, the real progress:
only from this feeling does there arise the will to struggle—
650 ( 1885-1886)
Physiologists should think again before positing the “instinct
of preservation” as the cardinal drive in an organic creature. A
living thing wants above all to discharge its force: “preservation”
is only a consequence of this.— Beware of superfluous teleological
principles! The entire concept “instinct of preservation” is one of
them.
“ The MS continues: “If only that had been preserved which proved
useful all the time, then above all the noxious, destructive, disintegrating ca­
pacities—the senseless, accidental,. . . ”

One cannot ascribe the most basic and primeval activities of
protoplasm to a will to self-preservation, for it takes into itself
absurdly more than would be required to preserve it; and, above
all, it does not thereby “preserve itself,” it falls apart— The drive
that rules here has to explain precisely this absence of desire for
self-preservation: “hunger” is an interpretation based on far more
complicated organisms (— hunger is a specialized and later form
of the drive, an expression of a division of labor in the service of
a higher drive that rules over it).
652 (March-June 1888)
It is not possible to take hunger as the primum mobile,93
any more than self-preservation. To understand hunger as a con­
sequence of undernourishment means: hunger as the consequence
of a will to power that no longer achieves mastery. It is by no
means a question of replacing a loss— only later, as a result of
the division of labor, after the will to power has learned to take
other roads to its satisfaction, is an organism’s need to appropriate
reduced to hunger, to the need to replace what has been lost.
653 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The false “altruism” of biologists is ridiculous: propagation
among amoebas seems to be the throwing off of ballast, a pure ad­
vantage. The excretion of useless material.
654 (1885-1886)
A protoplasm divides in two when its power is no longer
adequate to control what it has appropriated: procreation is the
consequence of an impotency.
When, from hunger, the males seek out the females and are
united with them, procreation is the consequence of a hunger.

The weaker presses to the stronger from a need for nourish­
ment; it wants to get under it, if possible to become one with it.
The stronger, on the contrary, drives others away; it does not
want to perish in this manner; it grows and in growing it splits
itself into two or more parts. The greater the impulse toward unity,
the more firmly may one conclude that weakness is present; the
greater the impulse towards variety, differentiation, inner decay,
the more force is present.
The drive to approach— and the drive to thrust something
back are the bond, in both *the inorganic and the organic world.
The entire distinction is a prejudice.
The will to power in every combination of forces, defending
itself against the stronger, lunging at the weaker, is more correct.
N.B.: Processes as “entities,”04
656 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The will to power can manifest itself only against resistances;
therefore it seeks that which resists it— this is the primeval tendency
of the protoplasm when it extends pseudopodia and feels about.
Appropriation and assimilation are above all a desire to overwhelm,
a forming, shaping and reshaping, until at length that which has
been overwhelmed has entirely gone over into the power domain
of the aggressor and has increased the same.— If this incorpora­
tion is not successful, then the form probably falls to pieces; and
the duality appears as a consequence of the will to power: in order
not to let go what has been conquered, the will to power divides
itself into two wills (in some cases without completely surrendering
the connection between its two parts).
“Hunger” is only a narrower adaptation after the basic drive
for power has won a more spiritual form.

What is “active”?— reaching out for power.
“Nourishment”— is only derivative; the original phenomenon
is: to desire to incorporate everything.

was not enough to organize the entire appropriated material,
there came into force an opposing will which took in hand

struggle with the original will.
“Pleasure”— as a feeling of power {presupposing displeasure).

1. The organic functions translated back to the basic will,
the will to power—and understood as offshoots.
2. The will to power specializes as will to nourishment, to
property, to tools, to servants (those who obey) and masters: the
body as an example.— The stronger will directs the weaker.
There is absolutely no other kind of causality than that of will
upon will. Not explained mechanistically.
3. Thinking, feeling, willing in all living beings. What is a
pleasure but: an excitation of the feeling of power by an obstacle
(even more strongly by rhythmic obstacles and resistances)— so

to be very great, the pains must be very protracted and the tension
of the bow tremendous.

The evidence of the body.— Granted that the “soul” is an
attractive and mysterious idea which philosophers have rightly
abandoned only with reluctance— perhaps that which they have
since learned to put in its place is even more attractive, even more
mysterious. The human body, in which the most distant and most
recent past of all organic development again becomes living and
corporeal, through which and over and beyond which a tremendous
inaudible stream seems to flow: the body is a more astonishing

348

THE

idea than the old “soul.” In all ages, there has been more faith
in the body, as our most personal possession, our most certain
being, in short our ego, than in the spirit (or the “soul,” or the
subject, as school language now has it instead of soul). It has
never occurred to anyone to regard his stomach as a strange or,
say, a divine stomach: but to conceive his ideas as “inspired,” his
evaluations as “implanted by a God,” his instincts as activity in a
half-light— for this tendency and taste in men there are witnesses
from all ages of mankind. Even now there is ample evidence
among artists of a sort of wonderment and respectful suspension
of judgment when they are faced with the question of the means
by which they achieved their best work and from which world the
creative idea came to them; when they ask this, they exhibit somethink like innocence and childlike shamefacedness; they hardly
dare to say “it came from me, it was my hand that threw the
dice.”
Conversely, even those philosophers and religious teachers
who had the most compelling ground in their logic and piety to
consider their bodies a deception (and, indeed, as a deception
overcome and done with) could not help acknowledging the foolish
fact that the body has not gone away; of which the strangest wit­
nesses are to be found partly in Paul, partly in the Vedanta phi­
losophy. But what, after all, does strength of belief mean? It could
still be a very foolish belief!— This should be reflected on:—
And after all, if belief in the body is only the result of an
inference: supposing it were a false inference, as the idealists
assert, is it not a question mark against the spirit itself that it
should be the cause of such false inferences? Supposing multiplicity,
space and time, and motion (and whatever else may be the pre­
suppositions of a belief in what is bodily) were errors— what
mistrust would this arouse against the spirit that had prompted
such presuppositions? Let is suffice that, for the present, belief
in the body is always a stronger belief than belief in the spirit;
and whoever desires to undermine it, also undermines at the
same time most thoroughly belief in the authority of the spirit!

most intelligent and most pliable tools).

Why is all activity, even that of a sense, associated with
pleasure? Because before it an obstacle, a burden existed? Or
rather because all doing is an overcoming, a becoming master, and
increases the feeling of power?— Pleasure in thinking.— Ulti­
mately, it is not only the feeling of power, but the pleasure in
creating and in the thing created; for all activity enters our con­
sciousness as consciousness of a “work.”

When we do something there arises a feeling of force,65 often
even before the deed, occasioned by the idea of what is to be done
(as at the sight of an enemy or an obstacle to which we feel our­
selves equal): it is always an accompanying feeling. We instinc­
tively think that this feeling of force is the cause of the action,
that it is “the force.” Our belief in causality is belief in force and
its effect; a transference from our experience; and we identify
force and the feeling of force.— Force, however, never moves
things; the force we feel “does not set the muscles in motion.”
“We have no idea, no experience, of such a process.”— “Just as
we have no experience of force as the cause of motion, so we have
no experience of the necessity of any motion.” Force is supposed
to be that which compels! “We experience only that one thing
follows upon another.— We have no experience of either com­
pulsion or arbitrariness in the following of one thing upon another.”
Causality is created only by thinking compulsion into the process,
A certain “comprehension” is the consequence, i.e., we have made
the process more human, “more familiar” : the familiar is the
familiar habit of human compulsion associated with the feeling of
force.

I have the intention of raising my arm: supposing I know as

mechanics and specially instructed in the formulas applicable here,
I should not be able to raise my arm one whit the better or the

apart, as if in two different domains.—

From time immemorial we have ascribed the value of an
action, a character, an existence, to the intention, the purpose for
the sake of which one has acted or lived: this age-old idiosyncrasy
finally takes a dangerous turn— provided, that is, that the absence
of intention and purpose in events comes more and more to the
forefront of consciousness. Thus there seems to be in prepara­
tion a universal disvaluation: “Nothing has any meaning”— this
melancholy sentence means “All meaning lies in intention, and if
intention is altogether lacking, then meaning is altogether lacking,
too.” In accordance with this valuation, one was constrained to
transfer the value of life to a “life after death,” or to the progressive
development of ideas or of mankind or of the people or beyond
mankind; but with that one had arrived at a progressus in infinitum
of purposes: one was at last constrained to make a place for one­
self in the “world process” (perhaps with the dysdaemonistic®6
perspective that it was a process into nothingness).
In this regard, “purpose” requires a more vigorous critique:
one must understand that an action is never caused by a purpose;
that purpose and means are interpretations whereby certain points
in an event are emphasized and selected at the expense of other
points, which, indeed, form the majority; that every single time
something is done with a purpose in view, something fundamentally
different and other occurs; that every purposive action is like the
supposed purposiveness of the heat the sun gives off: the enormously
greater part is squandered; a part hardly worth considering serves
a “purpose,” has “meaning” ; that a “purpose” and its “means”
provide an indescribably imprecise description, which can, indeed,
issue commands as a prescription, as a “will,” but which presup­
poses a system of obedient and trained tools, which in place of
indefinite entities posit nothing but fixed magnitudes (i.e., we
imagine a system of shrewder but narrower intellects that posit
purposes and means, in order to be able to ascribe to our only
” Nietzsche’s coinage, after “eu-daemon,” ueu-daemonism,” which means
“good spirit,” “an ethic of happiness.” “Dys-" is the antonym of “eu-” and
means “ill” or “bad,” Hence: evil-spirited or unhappy.

known “purpose” the role of the “cause of an action,” to which
procedure we really have no right: it would mean solving a prob­
lem by placing the solution in a world inaccessible to our observa­
tion— ).
Finally: why could “a purpose” not be an epiphenomenon
in the series of changes in the activating forces that bring about
the purposive action— a pale image sketched in consciousness
beforehand that serves to orient us concerning events, even as a
symptom of events, not as their cause?— But with this we have
criticized the will itself: is it not an illusion to take for a cause
that which rises to consciousnes3 as an act of will? Are not all
phenomena of consciousness merely terminal phenomena, final
links in a chain, but apparently conditioning one another in their
succession on one level of consciousness? This could be an illu­
sion—
667 (1883-1888)
Science does not ask what drives us to this will: it rather
denies that will is exercised, and holds that something quite dif­
ferent occurs— in short, that the belief in “will” and “purpose” is
an illusion. It does not inquire after the motives of an action, as if
these had been present in consciousness before the action; but it
first breaks up the action into a group of mechanistic phenomena
and seeks the previous history of this mechanistic motion—but it
does not seek it in feeling, sensation, thinking. It can never take the
explanation from this quarter: sensation is precisely the material
that is to be explained,— Its problem is: to explain the world
without taking sensations as causes; for that would mean: consider­
ing sensations as the cause of sensations. Its task is certainly not
accomplished.
Therefore: either no will— the hypothesis of science— or free
will. The latter assumption the dominant feeling from which we
cannot get loose, even if the scientific hypothesis were proved true.
The popular belief in cause and effect is founded on the
presupposition that free will is the cause of every effect: it is
only from this that we derive the feeling of causality. Thus there
is also in it the feeling that every cause is not an effect but always
only a cause— if the will is the cause. “Our acts of will are not
necessary”— this idea is contained in the concept “will,” What is

book th re e :

Principles of A New Evaluation

353

necessary is the effect following upon the cause— that is what we
feel. That our willing, too, is in every case a compulsion is a
hypothesis.
668 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
“Willing” is not “desiring,” striving, demanding: it is dis­
tinguished from these by the affect of commanding.
There is no such thing as “willing,” but only a willing some­
thing: one must not remove the aim from the total condition—
as epistemologists do. “Willing” as they understand it is as little
a reality as “thinking” : it is a pure fiction.
It is part of willing that something is commanded (— which
naturally does not mean that the will is “effected” ).
That state of tension by virtue of which a force seeks to dis­
charge itself—is not an example of “willing.”
669 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
“Displeasure” and “pleasure” are the most stupid means
imaginable of expressing judgments: which naturally does not
mean that the judgments made audible in this manner must be
stupid. The abandonment of all substantiation and logicality, a Yes
or No in the reduction to a passionate desire to have or a rejection,
an imperative abbreviation whose utility is unmistakable: this is
pleasure and displeasure. It originates in the central sphere of
the intellect; its presupposition is an infinitely speeded-up per­
ception, ordering, subsumption, calculating, inferring: pleasure and
displeasure are always terminal phenomena, not “causes.”
The decision about what arouses pleasure and what arouses
displeasure depends upon the degree of power: something that in
relation to a small quantum of power appears dangerous and seems
to require the speediest defense, can evoke, given the consciousness
of greater power, a voluptuous excitation and a feeling of pleasure.
All feelings of pleasure and displeasure presuppose a calcula­
tion of utility and harmfulness to the whole; in other words, a
sphere where an end (a state) is desired and means for it are
selected. Pleasure and displeasure are never “basic facts.”
Feelings of pleasure and displeasure are reactions of the will
(affects), in which the intellectual center fixes the value of cer­

354

tain changes which have occurred in relation to the value of the
whole; at the same time the introduction of counteractions.
670 (1883-1888)
The belief in “affects"— Affects are a construction of the
intellect, an invention of causes that do not exist. All general bodily
feelings that we do not understand are interpreted intellectually;
i.e., a reason is sought in persons, experiences, etc., for why one
feels this way or that. Thus something disadvantageous, dangerous,
or strange is posited as the cause of our ill humor; in fact, it is
added on to ill humor, in order to render our condition comprehen­
sible. Frequent rushes of blood to the brain accompanied by a
choking sensation are interpreted as “anger” : persons and things
that rouse us to anger are means of relieving our physiological
condition.— Subsequently, after long habituation, certain incidents
are so regularly associated with certain general feelings that the
sight of certain incidents arouses the corresponding feeling and in
particular brings with it this congestion of blood, production of
semen, etc., through closeness of association. We then say that
“the affect is aroused.”
Judgments already inhere in “pleasure” and “displeasure” ;
stimuli are differentiated according to whether or not they further
the feeling of power.
The belief in willing. To posit a belief as the cause of a
mechanistic motion is to believe in miracles. The consistency of
science demands that, once we have made the world thinkable by
means of little images, we should also make the affects, desires,
will, etc., thinkable, i.e., deny them and treat them as errors of
the intellect.
671 (1883-1888)
Freedom of will or no freedom of will?— There is no such
thing as “will” ; it is only a simplifying conception of understanding,
as is “matter.”
All actions must first be made possible mechanically before
they are willed. Or: the “purpose" usually comes into the mind only
after everything has been prepared for its execution. The end is
an “inner” “stimulus”— no more.

The most recent history of an action relates to this action:
but further back lies a prehistory which covers a wider field: the
individual action is at the same time a part of a much more exten­
sive, later fact. The briefer and the more extended processes are
not separated—
673 (1883-1888)
Theory of chance. The soul a selective and self-nourishing
entity, perpetually extremely shrewd and creative (this creative
force is usually overlooked! is conceived only as “passive” ).
To recognize the active force, the creative force in the chance
event:— chance itself is only the clash of creative impulses.
674 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
In the tremendous multiplicity of events within an organism,
the part which becomes conscious to us is a mere means: and the
little bit of “virtue,” “selflessness,” and similar fictions are refuted
radically by the total balance of events. We should study our organ­
ism in all its immorality—
The animal functions are, as a matter of principle, a million
times more important than all our beautiful moods and heights of
consciousness: the latter are a surplus, except when they have to
serve as tools of those animal functions. The entire conscious life,
the spirit along with the soul, the heart, goodness, and virtue— in
whose service do they labor? In the service of the greatest possible
perfection of the means (means Of nourishment, means of enhance­
ment) of the basic animal functions: above all, the enhancement
of life.
What one used to call “body” and “flesh” is of such unspeak­
ably greater importance: the remainder is a small accessory. The
task of spinning on the chain of life, and in such a way that the
thread grows ever more powerful— that is the task.
But consider how heart, soul, virtue, spirit practically con­
spire together to subvert this systematic task— as if they were the
end in view!— The degeneration of life is conditioned essentially

by the extraordinary proneness to error of consciousness: it is
held in check by instinct the least of all and therefore blunders
the longest and the most thoroughly.
To measure whether existence has value according to the
pleasant or unpleasant feelings aroused in this consciousness: can
one think of a madder extravagance of vanity? For it is only a
means— and pleasant or unpleasant feelings are also only means!
What is the objective measure of value? Solely the quantum
of enhanced and organized power.®7

{The value of devaluing.— What I demand is]68 that one
should take the doer back into the deed after having conceptually
removed the doer and thus emptied the deed; that one should take
doing something, the “aim,” the “intention,” the “purpose,” back
into the deed after having artificially removed all this and thus
emptied the deed.
All “purposes,” “aims,” “meaning” are only modes of ex­
pression and metamorphoses of one will that is inherent in all
events: the will to power. To have purposes, aims, intentions,
willing in general, is the same thing as willing to be stronger,
willing to grow— and, in addition, willing the means to this.
The most universal and basic instinct in all doing and willing
has for precisely this reason remained the least known and most
hidden, because in praxi we always follow its commandments,
because we are this commandment—
All valuations are only consequences and narrow perspectives
in the service of this one will: valuation itself is only this will to
power.
A critique of being from the point of view of any one of these
values is something absurd and erroneous. Even supposing that a
process of decline begins in this way, this process still stands in
the service of this will.
To appraise being itself! But this appraisal itself is still this
being!— and if we say no, we still do what we are.
One must comprehend the absurdity of this posture of judging

existence, and then try to understand what is really involved in it.
It is symptomatic.
676 (1883-1888)
On the Origin of Our Evaluations
We can analyze our body spatially, and then we gain pre­
cisely the same image of it as we have of the stellar system, and the
distinction between the organic and inorganic is no longer notice­
able. Formerly, one explained the motions of the stars as effects
produced by entities conscious of a purpose. One no longer needs
this explanation, and in regard to bodily motions and changes, too,
one has long since abandoned the belief in an explanation by means
of a consciousness that determines purposes. By far the greater
number of motions have nothing whatever to do with consciousness;
nor with sensation. Sensations and thoughts are something ex­
tremely insignificant and rare in relation to the countless number
of events that occur every moment.
On the other hand, we perceive that a purposiveness rules
over the smallest events that is beyond our understanding: planning,
selectivity, co-ordination, reparation, etc. In short, we discover
an activity that would have to be ascribed to a far higher and more
comprehensive intellect than we know of. We learn to think less
highly of all that is conscious; we unlearn responsibility for our­
selves, since we as conscious, purposive creatures, are only the
smallest part of us. Of the numerous influences operating at every
moment, e.g., air, electricity, we sense almost nothing: there could
well be forces that, although we never sense them, continually
influence us. Pleasure and pain are very rare and scarce appear­
ances compared with the countless stimuli that a cell or organ
exercises upon another cell or organ.
We are in the phase of modesty of consciousness. Ultimately,
we understand the conscious ego itself only as a tool in the service
of a higher, comprehensive intellect; and then we are able to ask
whether all conscious willing, all conscious purposes, all evaluations
are not perhaps only means through which something essentially
different from what appears in consciousness is to be achieved. We
think: it is a question of our pleasure and displeasure------ but
pleasure and displeasure could be means through which we have
to achieve something that lies outside our consciousness.------ It

358

must be shown to what extent everything conscious remains on the
surface; how an action and the image of an action differ, how little
one knows of what precedes an action; how fantastic are our
feelings of “freedom of will,” “cause and effect”; how thoughts
and images are, like words, only signs of thoughts; the inexplic­
ability of every action; the superficiality of all praise and blame;
how essential fiction and conceits are in which we dwell con­
sciously; how all our words refer to fictions (our affects, too),
and how the bond between man and man depends on the trans­
mission and elaboration of these fictions; while fundamentally
the real bond (through procreation) goes its unknown way. Does
this belief in common fictions really change men? Or is the entire
realm of ideas and evaluations itself only an expression of unknown
changes? Are there really will, purposes, thoughts, values? Is the
whole of conscious life perhaps only a reflected image? And even
when evaluation seems to determine the nature of a man, funda­
mentally something quite different is happening! In short: supposing
that purposiveness in the work of nature could be explained with­
out the assumption of an ego that posits purposes: could our
positing of purposes, our willing, etc., not perhaps be also only
a language of signs for something altogether different, namely
something that does not will and is unconscious? Only the faintest
reflection of that natural expediency in the organic but not different
from it?
Put briefly: perhaps the entire evolution of the spirit is a
question of the body; it is the history of the development of a
higher body that emerges into our sensibility. The organic is
rising to yet higher levels. Our lust for knowledge of nature is
a means through which the body desires to perfect itself. Or rather:
hundreds of thousands of experiments are made to change the
nourishment, the mode of living and of dwelling of the body;
consciousness and evaluations in the body, all kinds of pleasure
and displeasure, are signs of these changes and experiments. In
the long run, it is not a question of man at all: he is to be overcome.

duction to cruelty, a feeling of security, playing the judge and
standing outside, etc. One must examine the artist himself, and
his psychology (critique of the drive to play as a release of force,
a pleasure in change, in impressing one’s soul on something foreign,
the absolute egoism of the artist, etc.) What drives he sublimates.
The scientific view of the world: critique of the psychological
need for science. The desire to make comprehensible; the desire
to make practical, useful, exploitable— to what extent anti-aesthetic.
Only value, what can be counted and calculated. How an average
type of man seeks to gain the upper hand in this way. Dreadful
when history is appropriated in this way— the realm of the superior,
of those who judge. What drives they sublimate!
The religious view of the world: critique of the religious man.
He is not necessarily the moral man, but the man of powerful
exaltations and deep depressions who interprets the former with
gratitude or suspicion and does not derive them from himself
(— not the latter either). Essentially the man who feels himself
“unfree,” who sublimates his moods, his instincts of subjection.
The moral view of the world: The feelings of a social order of
rank are projected into the universe: irremovability, law, classifica­
tion and co-ordination, because they are valued the highest, are
also sought in the highest places— above the universe or behind
the universe.
What is common to all: the ruling drives want to be viewed
also as the highest courts of value in general, indeed as creative
and ruling powers. It is clear that these drives either oppose or
subject each other (join together synthetically or alternate in
dominating). Their profound antagonism is so great, however,
that where they all seek satisfaction, a man of profound mediocrity
must result.
678 ( 1883-1888)
Whether the origin of our apparent “knowledge” is not to be

the oldest needs?

of the total living organic world. That he endures proves that a
species of interpretation (even though accretions are still being
added) has also endured, that the system of interpretation has
not changed. “Adaptation.”
Our “dissatisfaction,” our “ideal,” etc., is perhaps the con­
sequence of this incorporated piece of interpretation, of our per­
spective point of view; perhaps organic life will in the end perish
through it—even as the division of labor in organisms is ac­
companied by a withering and weakening of the parts, and finally
leads to the death of the whole. The destruction of organic life,
even in its highest form, must follow the same pattern as the
destruction of the individual.
679 ( 1883-1888)
Individuation, judged from the standpoint of the theoiy of
descent, demonstrates a continual falling apart of one into two,
and also the continual passing away of individuals who carry for­
ward the evolution: by far the greater number die out every time
( “the body”).
The basic phenomenon: countless individuals sacrificed for the
sake of a few, to make them possible.— One must not let oneself
be deceived; it is just the same with peoples and races: they con­
stitute the “body” for the production of isolated valuable indi­
viduals, who carry on the great process.
680 ( 1883-1888)
Against the theory that the isolated individual has in view
the advantage of the species, of his posterity, at the cost of his
own advantage: that is only an appearance.
The tremendous importance the individual accords to the
sexual instinct is not a result of its importance for the species,
but arises because procreation is the real achievement of the indi­
vidual and consequently his highest interest, his highest expression
of power (not judged from the consciousness but from the center
of the whole individuation).
681 ( 1883-1888)
Basic errors of biologists hitherto: it is not a question of the

species but of more powerful individuals. (The many are only a
means).
Life is not the adaptation of inner circumstances to outer
ones, but will to power, which, working from within, incorporates
and subdues more and more of that which is “outside.”
These biologists carry forward moral evaluations (— the
“higher value of altruism,” hostility against the lust to dominate,
against war, against what is not useful, against orders of rank and
class).
682 (Spring-Fall 1887)
In natural science, the moral depreciation of the ego goes
hand in hand with an overestimation of the species. But the species
is something just as illusory as the ego: one had made a false
distinction. The ego is a hundred times more than merely a unit
in the chain of members; it is this chain itself, entirely; and the
species is a mere abstraction from the multiplicity of these chains
and their partial similarity. That the individual is sacrificed to the
species, as has so often been asserted, is certainly not a fact;
rather only an example of false interpretation.

can it have? or has domestication in general any definite value?—
There are grounds for denying the latter.
The school of Darwin certainly makes a great effort to con­
vince us of the reverse: it wants to show that the effect of domes­
tication can become profound, even fundamental. In the meantime,
we stick to our old opinion: up to now, domestication has produced
only quite superficial effects— when it has not produced degenera“ “Animals never progress as a species. Only m an progresses as a

tion. And everything that eludes the hand and discipline of man
returns almost at once to its natural state. The type remains con­
stant: one cannot *“denaturer la nature ”
One counts on the struggle for existence, the death of the
weaker creatures and the survival of the most robust and gifted;
consequently one imagines a continual growth in perfection. We
have convinced ourselves, conversely, that in the struggle for
existence chance serves the weak as well as the strong; that cunning
often prevails over strength; that the fruitfulness of the species
stands in a notable relation to its chances of destruction—
One credits natural selection at the same time with the power
of slow and endless metamorphosis; one wants to believe that
every advantage is inherited and grows stronger and stronger with
succeeding generations (whereas heredity is so capricious that— );
one observes the fortunate adaptation of certain creatures to very
special conditions of life, and one explains that these adaptations
result from the influence of the milieu.
But one nowhere finds any example of Unconscious selection
(absolutely not). The most disparate individuals unite with one
another* the extremes are submerged in the mass. Everything com­
petes to preserve its type; creatures with exterior markings to protect
them from danger do not lose them when they encounter conditions
in which they live without danger— When they live in places in
which their dress ceases to hide them they do not by any means
adapt to the new milieu.
One has so exaggerated the selection of the most beautiful
that it greatly exceeds the drive to beauty in our own race! In fact,
the most beautiful mate with utterly disinherited creatures, and
the biggest with the smallest. We almost always see males and
females take advantage of any chance encounter, exhibiting no
selectivity whatsoever.— Modification through food and climate

are lacking. Every type has its limits; beyond these there is no
evolution. Up to this point, absolute regularity.
Primitive creatures are said to be the ancestors of those
now existing. But a look at the fauna and flora of the Tertiary
merely permits us to think of an as yet unexplored country that
harbors types that do not exist elsewhere, while those existing else­
where are missing.70
*

M y general view,— First proposition: man as a species is not
progressing. Higher types are indeed attained, but they do not
last. The level of the species is not raised.
Second proposition: man as a species does not represent
any progress compared with any other animal. Tile whole ani­
mal and vegetable kingdom does not evolve from the lower to
the higher— but all at the same time, in utter disorder, over and
against each other. The richest and most complex forms— for
the expression “higher type” means no more than this— perish
more easily: only the lowest preserve an apparent indestructibility.
The former are achieved only rarely and maintain their superi­
ority with difficulty; the latter are favored by a compromising
fruitfulness.
Among men, too, the higher types, the lucky strokes of evolu­
tion, perish most easily as fortunes change. They are exposed to
every kind of decadence: they are extreme, and that almost means
decadents.
The brief spell of beauty * of genius, of Caesar, is sui generis:
such things are not inherited. The type is hereditary; a type is
nothing extreme, no “lucky stroke”—
This is not due to any special fatality or malevolence of nature,
but simply to the concept “higher type” : the higher type represents
an incomparably greater complexity— a greater sum of co-ordin­
ated elements: so its disintegration's also incomparably more likely.
The “genius” is the sublimest machine there is— consequently the
most fragile.
Third proposition: the domestication (the “culture” ) of man
does not go deep— Where it does go deep it at once becomes
degeneration (type: the Christian). The “savage” (or, in moral

his recoyery, his cure from “culture”—
685 (March-June 1888)
Anti-Darwin.-^- What surprises me most when I survey the
broad destinies of man is that I always see before me the opposite
of that which Darwin and his school see or want to see today:
selection in favor of the stronger, better-constituted, and the prog­
ress of the species. Precisely the opposite is palpable: the elimina­
tion of the lucky strokes, the uselessness of the more highly
developed types, the inevitable dominion of the average, even
the sub-average types. If we are not shown why man should be
an exception among creatures, I incline to the prejudice that the
school of Darwin has been deluded everywhere.
That will to power in which I recognize the ultimate ground
and character of all change provides us with the reason why selec­
tion is not in favor of the exceptions and lucky strokes: the
strongest and most fortunate are Weak when opposed by organized
herd instincts, by the timidity of the weak, by the vast majority.
My general view of the world of values Shows that it is not the
lucky strokes, the select types, that have the upper hand in the
supreme values that are today placed over mankind; rather it is
the decadent types— perhaps there is nothing in the world more in­
teresting than this unwelcome spectacle—
Strange though it may sound, one always has to defend71 the
strong against the weak; the fortunate against the unfortunate; the
healthy against those degenerating and afflicted with hereditary
taints. If one translates reality into a morality, this morality is:
the mediocre are worth more than the exceptions; the decadent
forms more than the mediocre; the will to nothingness has the
upper hand over the will to life— and the overall aim is, in
Christian, Buddhist, Schopenhauerian terms: “better not to be
than to be.”
I rebel against the translation of reality into a morality:
therefore I abhor Christianity with a deadly hatred, because it
created sublime words and gestures to throw over a horrible
reality the cloak of justice, virtue, and divinity—

I see all philosophers, I see science kneeling before a real­
ity that is the reverse of the struggle for existence as taught by
Darwin’s school— that is to say, I see on top and surviving
everywhere those Who compromise life and the value of life.—
The error of the school of Darwin becomes a problem to me:
how can one be so blind as to see so badly at this point?
That species represent any progress is the most unreasonable
assertion in the world: so far they represent one level; That the
higher organisms have evolved from the lower has not been dem­
onstrated in a single case. I see how the lower preponderate
through their numbers, their shrewdness, their cunning— I do not
see how an accidental variation gives an advantage, at least not
for so long a period; why an accidental change should grow so
strong would be something else needing explanation.
I
find the “cruelty of nature,” of which so much is said, in
another place: she is cruel towards her children of fortune, she
spares and protects and loves les humbles, just as— 12
In summa: growth in the power of a species is perhaps guar­
anteed less by a preponderance of its children of fortune, of strong
members, than by a preponderance of average and lower types—
The latter possess great fruitfulness and duration; with the former
comes an increase in danger, rapid wastage, speedy reduction in
numbers.
686 ( 1884)
Man hitherto— as it were, an embryo of the man of the
future;— all the form-giving forces directed toward the latter are
present in the former; and because they are tremendous, the more
a present-day individual determines the future, the more he will
suffer. This is the profoundest conception of suffering: the formgiving forces are in painful collision.— The isolation of the indi­
vidual ought not to deceive us: something flows oh underneath

most powerful goad in the process towards the most distant goals:
his search for his happiness is the means that holds together and
moderates the form-giving forces, so they do not destroy them­
selves.

Superabundant force in spirituality, setting itself new goals;
by no means merely commanding and leading on behalf of the
lower world or the preservation of the organism, the “individual.”
We are more than the individuals: we are the whole chain as
well, with the tasks of all the futures of that chain.

3. Theory of the Will to Power and of Values
688 (March-June 1888)
Unitary conception of psychology.— We are accustomed to
consider the development of an immense abundance of forms
compatible with an origin in unity.
■ [My theory would be:— ]7a that the will to power is the
primitive form of affect, that all other affects are only develop­
ments of it;
that it is notably enlightening to posit power in place of
individual “happiness” (after which every living thing is supposed
to be striving): “there is a striving for power, for an increase
of power”;—pleasure is only a symptom of the feeling of power
attained, a consciousness of a difference (— there is no striving
for pleasure: but pleasure supervenes when that which is being
striven for is attained: pleasure is an accompaniment, pleasure
is not the motive-—);
that all driving force is will to power, that there is no other
physical, dynamic or psychic force except this.
In our science, where the concept of cause and effect is
redued to the relationship of equivalence, with the object of
proving that the same quantum of force is present on both sides,
the driving force is lacking: we observe only results, and we
consider them equivalent in content and force74—

It is simply a matter of experience that change never ceases:
we have not the slightest inherent reason for assuming that one
change must follow upon another. On the contrary: a condition
once achieved would seem to be obliged to preserve itself if there
were not in it a capacity for desiring not to preserve itself—
Spinoza’s law of “self-preservation” ought really to put a stop
to change: but this law is false, the opposite is true. It can be
shown most clearly that every living thing does everything it can
not to preserve itself but to become more—
689 (March-June 1888)
Critique of the concept: cause.73— From a psychological
point of view the concept “cause” is our feeling of power result­
ing from the so-called act of will— our concept “effect” the
superstition that this feeling of power is the motive power itself—
A condition that accompanies an event and is itself an effect
of the event is projected as the “sufficient reason” for the event;—
the relation of tensions in our feeling of power (pleasure as the
feeling of power), of a resistance overcome— are they illusions?—
If we translate the concept “cause” back to the only sphere
known to us, from which we have derived it, we cannot imagine
any change that does not involve a will to power. We do 'not
know how to explain a change except as the encroachment of
one power upon another power.
Mechanics shows us only the results, and then only in images
(motion is a figure of speech). Gravity itself has no mechanistic
cause, since it itself is the ground of mechanistic results.
The will to accumulate force is special to the phenomena of
life, to nourishment, procreation, inheritance— to society, state,
custom, authority. Should we not be permitted to assume this
will as a motive cause in chemistry, too?— and in the cosmic
order?
Not merely conservation of energy, but maximal economy in
use, so the only reality is the will to grow stronger of every
center of force— not self-preservation, but the will to appropriate,
dominate, increase, grow stronger.
The possibility of science should be proved by a principle

of causality?76 “From like causes like effects”—r “A permanent
law governing things”— “An invariable order”?— Because some­
thing is calculable, does that mean it is necessary?
If something happens thus and not otherwise, that does not
imply a “principle,” “law,” “order,” [but the operation of]77
quanta of force the essence of which consists in exercising power
against other quanta of force.
Can we assume a striving for power divorced from a sensa­
tion of pleasure and displeasure, Le«, divorced from the feeling
of enhanced or diminished power? Is mechanism only a sign
language for the internal factual world of struggling and conquer­
ing quanta of will? All the presuppositions of mechanistic theory
— matter, atom, gravity, pressure and stress— are not “facts-inthemselves” but interpretations with the aid of psychical fictions.
Life, as the form of being most familiar to us, is specifically
a will to the accumulation of force; all the processes of life
depend on this: nothing wants to preserve itself, everything is
to be added and accumulated*
Life as a special case (hypothesis based upon it applied to
the total character of being— ) strives after a maximal feeling
of power; essentially a striving for more power; striving is noth­
ing other than striving for power; the basic and innermost thing
is still this will. (Mechanics is merely the semeiotics of the
results.)
690 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
One cannot discover the cause of there being any evolution
at all by studying evolution; one should not wish to think of it
as “becoming,” even less as having become— The “will to power”
cannot have become.

the rest of nature?— That is where its fundamental will stands
revealed.
692 (March-June 1888)
Is “will to power” a kind ot “will” or identical with the
concept “will”? Is it the same thing as desiring? or commanding?
Is it that “will” of which Schopenhauer said it was the “in-itself
of things”?
My proposition is: that the will of psychology hitherto is
an unjustified generalization, that this will does not exist at all,
that instead of grasping the idea of the development of one
definite will into many forms, one has eliminated the character
of the will by subtracting from it its content, its “whither?”— this
is in the highest degree the case with Schopenhauer: what he
calls “will” is a mere empty word. It is even less a question of a
“will to live” ; for life is merely a special case of the will to power;
— it is quite arbitrary to assert that everything strives to enter into
this form of the will to power.
693 (March-June 1888)
If the innermost essence of being is will to power, if pleasure
is every increase of power, displeasure every feeling of not being
able to resist or dominate; may we not then posit pleasure and
displeasure as cardinal facts? Is will possible without these two
oscillations of Yes and No?— But who feels pleasure?— But
who wants power?— Absurd question, if the essence itself is
power-wili and consequently feelings of pleasure and displeasure!
Nonetheless: opposites, obstacles are needed; therefore, relatively,
encroaching units—
694 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
The measure of failure and fatality must grow with the
resistance a force seeks to master; and as a force can expend
itself only on what resists it, there is necessarily an ingredient of
displeasure in every action. But this displeasure acts as a lure of
life and strengthens the will to power!

370

THE

WILL

TO P O W E R

695 (March-June 1888)
If pleasure and displeasure relate to the feeling of power,
then life must represent a growth in power, so that the difference
caused by this growth must enter consciousness— If one level
of power were maintained, pleasure would have only lowerings
of this level by which to set its standards, only states of displeas­
ure— not states of pleasure— The will to grow is of the essence
of pleasure: that power increases, that the difference enters con­
sciousness.
From a certain point onwards, in decadence, the opposite
difference enters consciousness, the decrease: the memory of
former moments of strength depresses present feelings of pleasure
— comparison now weakens pleasure.
696 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
It is not the satisfaction of the will that causes pleasure
(I want to fight this superficial theory— the absurd psychological
counterfeiting of the nearest things— ), but rather the will’s for­
ward thrust and again and again becoming master over that which
stands in its way. The feeling of pleasure lies precisely in the
dissatisfaction of the will, in the fact that the will is never satis­
fied unless it has opponents and resistance.— “The happy man” :
a herd ideal.
697 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
The normal dissatisfaction of our drives, e.g., hunger, the
sexual drive, the drive to motion, contains in it absolutely nothing
depressing; it works rather as an agitation of the feeling of life,
as every rhythm of small, painful stimuli strengthens it, (whatever
pessimists may say). This dissatisfaction, instead of making one
disgusted with life, is the great stimulus to life.
(One could perhaps describe pleasure in general as a rhythm
of little unpleasurable stimuli.)

Kant said: “I subscribe entirely to these sentences of Count

699 (March-June 1888)
Pain is something different from pleasure— I mean it is not
its opposite.
If the essence of “pleasure” has been correctly described as
a feeling of more power (hence as a feeling of difference, pre­
supposing a comparison), this does not yet furnish a definition of
the essence of “displeasure.” The false opposites in which the
people, and consequently language, believes, have always been
dangerous hindrances to the advance of truth. There are even
cases in which a kind of pleasure is conditioned by a certain
rhythmic sequence of little unpleasurable stimuli: in this way a
very rapid increase of the feeling of power, the feeling of pleasure,
is achieved; This is the case, e.g>, in tickling, also the sexual tickling
in the act of coitus: here we see displeasure at work as an in­
gredient of pleasure. It seems, a little hindrance that is overcome
and immediately followed by another little hindrance that is again
overcome— this game of resistance and victory arouses most
strongly that general feeling of superabundant, excessive power
that constitutes the essence of pleasure*
The opposite, an increase in the sensation of pain through
the introduction of little pleasurable stimuli, is lacking; for pleasure
and pain are not opposites.
Pain is an intellectual occurrence in which a definite judgment
is expressed—the judgment "harmful ” in which a long experience
is summarized. There is no pain as such. It is not being wounded
that hurts; but the experience of the bad consequences being
wounded can have for the whole organism expresses itself in that
profound shock that is called displeasure; (in the case of harm­
ful influences with which former men were unacquainted, e.g.,
those of new combinations of poisonous chemicals, pain bears
no witness— and we are lost).
The really specific thing in pain is always the protracted
shock, the lingering vibrations of a terrifying choc in the cerebral
center of the nervous system:-^- one does not really suffer from

the cause of pain (any sort of injury, for example), but from the
protracted disturbance of equilibrium that occurs as a result of
the choc. Pain is a sickness of the cerebral nerve centers— pleasure
is certainly not a sickness.
That pain is the cause of reflex actions has appearance and
even the prejudice of philosophers in its favor; but, if one observes
it closely, in cases of sudden pain the reflex comes noticeably
earlier than the sensation of pain. It would go ill with me if, when
I stumbled, I had to wait for the fact to ring the bell of con­
sciousness and for instructions how to act to be telegraphed back.
What I notice with the greatest possible clarity is rather that
the reflex of my foot follows first to prevent my falling, and then,
at a measurable distance in time, the sudden sensation of a kind
of painful wave ini the front part of my head. Thus one does not
react to the pain. Pain is subsequently projected to the wounded
place— but the nature of this local pain is nonetheless not an ex­
pression of the kind of the local injury; it is a mere place-sign
corresponding to the force and pitch of the injury the nerve centers
have received. That as, a result of this choc the muscular strength
of the organism is measurably lowered does not warrant our
seeking the essence of pain in a diminution of the feeling of power.
To repeat it again, one does not react to pain; displeasure is
not a “cause” of action. Pain itself is a reaction, the reflex is
another and earlier reaction—both originate in different places—

Intellectual nature of pain: it does not indicate what has
been damaged at the moment, but the value of the damage in
relation to the individual as a whole.

individual suffers—?

“The sum of displeasure outweighs the sum of pleasure;
consequently it would be better if the world did not exist”— “The
world is something that rationally should not exist because it
causes the feeling subject more displeasure than pleasure”— chatter
of this sort calls itself pessimism today!
Pleasure and displeasure are accidentals, not causes; they are

book th re e :

value judgments of the second rank, derived from a ruling value—
“useful,” “harmful,” speaking in the form of feelings, and con­
sequently absolutely sketchy and dependent. For with every “use­
ful,” “harmful,” one still has to ask in a hundred different ways:
“for what?”
I despise this pessimism of sensibility: it is itself a sign of
deeply impoverished life.79
702 (March-June 1888)
Man does not seek pleasure and does not avoid displeasure:
one will realize which famous prejudice I am contradicting.
Pleasure and displeasure are mere consequences, mere epiphenomena—what man wants, what every smallest part of a living
organism wants, is an increase of power. Pleasure or displeasure
follow from the striving after that; driven by that will it seeks
resistance, it needs something that opposes it— Displeasure, as
an obstacle to its will to power, is therefore a normal fact, the
normal ingredient of every organic event; man does not avoid
it, he is rather in continual need of it; every victory, every feeling
of pleasure, every event, presupposes a resistance overcome.
Let us take the simplest case, that of primitive nourishment:
the protoplasm extends it pseudopodia in search of something that
resists it—not from hunger but from will to power.80 Thereupon
it attempts to overcome, appropriate, assimilate what it encounters:
what one calls “nourishment” is merely a derivative phenomenon,
an application of the original will to become stronger.
Displeasure thus does not merely not have to result in a
diminution of our feeling of power, but in the average case it
actually stimulates this feeling of power— the obstacle is the
stimulus of this will to power.

with exhaustion; the latter does indeed represent a profound
diminution and reduction of the will to power, a measurable loss
of force. That is to say: there exists (a) displeasure as a means of
stimulating the increase of power, and (b) displeasure following an
overexpenditure of power; in the first case a stimulus, in the second
the result of an excessive stimulation— Inability to resist is charac­
teristic of the latter kind of displeasure: a challenge to that which
resists belongs to the former— The only pleasure still felt in the
condition of exhaustion is falling asleep; victory is the pleasure
in the other case—
The great confusion on the part of psychologists consisted
in not distinguishing beween these two kinds of pleasure— that of
falling asleep and that of victory. The exhausted want rest, relax­
ation, peace, calm— the happiness of the nihilistic religions and
philosophies; the rich and living want victory, opponents over­
come, the overflow of the feeling of power across wider domains
than hitherto. All healthy functions of the organism have this
need— and the whole organism81 is such a complex of systefns
struggling for an increase of the feeling of power-----704 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
How does it happen that the basic articles of faith in psychol­
ogy are one and all the most arrant misrepresentations and coun­
terfeits? “Man strives after happiness,” e.g.— how much of that
is true? In order to understand what “life” is, what kind of striving
and tension life is, the formula must apply as well to trees and
plants as to animals. “What does a plant strive after?”— but here
we have already invented a false unity which does not exist: the
fact of a millionfold growth with individual and semi-individual
initiatives is concealed and denied if we begin by positing a crude
unity “plant.” That the very smallest “individuals” cannot be under­
stood in the sense of a “metaphysical individuality” and atom, that
their spere of power is continually changing— that is the first thing
that becomes obvious; but does each of them strive after happiness
when it changes in this way?—
But all expansion, incorporation, growth means striving
against something that resists; motion is essentially tied up with

any event desire something else if it desires displeasure in this way
and continually looks for it.— For what do the trees in a jungle

Man, become master over the forces of nature, master over

the conscious world of feelings, intentions, and valuations is a small
section. We have no right whatever to posit this piece of conscious­
ness as the aim and wherefore of this total phenomenon of life:
becoming conscious is obviously only one more means toward the
unfolding and extension of the power of life. Therefore it is a
piece of naivete to posit pleasure or spirituality or morality or any
other particular of the sphere of consciousness as the highest value
— and perhaps even to justify “the world” by means of this.
This is my basic objection to all philosophic-moralistic cosmoand theodicies, to all wherefores and highest values in philosophy
and theology hitherto. One kind of means has been misunderstood
as an end; conversely, life and the enhancement of its power has
been debased to a means.
If we wished to postulate a goal adequate to life, it could not
coincide with any category of conscious life; it would rather have
to explain all of them as a means to itself—
The “denial of life” as an aim of life, an aim of evolution!
Existence as a great stupidity! Such a lunatic interpretation is only
the product of measuring life by aspects of consciousness (pleasure
and displeasure, good and evil). Here the means are made to
stand against the end—the “unholy,” absurd, above all unpleasant
means— : how can an end that employs such means be worth
anything! But the mistake is that, instead of looking for a purpose
that explains the necessity of such means, we presuppose in advance
a goal that actually excludes such means; i.e., we take a desideratum
in respect of certain means (namely pleasant, rational, and virtu­
ous ones) as a norm, on the basis of which we posit what general
purpose would be desirable—
The fundamental mistake is simply that, instead of understand­
ing consciousness as a tool and particular aspect of the total life,
we posit it as the standard and the condition of life that is of
supreme value: it is the erroneous perspective of a parte ad totum84
— which is why all philosophers are instinctively trying to imagine
a total consciousness, a consciousness involved in all life and will,
in all that occurs, a “spirit,” “God.” But one has to tell them that
precisely this turns life into a monstrosity; that a “God” and total
sensorium would altogether be something on account of which life
would have to be condemned— Precisely that We have eliminated
the total consciousness that posited ends and means, is our great

relief—with that we are no longer compelled to be pessimists—
Our greatest reproach against existence was the existence of God—
708 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
[On the value of "becoming "— ] 85 If the motion of the world
aimed at a final state, that state would have been reached. The sole
fundamental fact, however, is that it does not aim at a final state;
and every philosophy and scientific hypothesis (e.g., mechanistic
theory) which necessitates such a final state is refuted by this funda­
mental fact.
I seek a conception of the world that takes this fact into
account. Becoming must be explained without recourse to final
intentions; becoming must appear justified at every moment (or
incapable of being evaluated; which amounts to the same thing);
the present must absolutely not be justified by reference to a future,
nor the past by reference to the present. “Necessity” not in the
shape of an overreaching, dominating total force, or that of a
prime mover; even less as a necessary condition for something
valuable. To this end it is necessary to deny a total consciousness
of becoming, a “God,” to avoid bringing all events under the aegis
of a being who feels and knows but does not will: “God” is useless
if he does not want anything, and moreover this means positing a
summation of displeasure and unlogic which would debase the
total value of “becoming.” Fortunately such a summarizing power
is missing (— a suffering and all-seeing God, a “total sensorium”
and “cosmic spirit”80 would be the greatest objection to being).
More strictly: one must admit nothing that has being—
because then becoming would lose its value and actually appear
meaningless and superfluous.
Consequently one must ask how the illusion of being could
have arisen (was bound to arise);
likewise: how all value judgments that rest on the hypothesis
that there are beings are disvalued.
But here one realizes that this hypothesis of beings is the
source of all world-defamation (— the “better world,” the “true
world,” the “world beyond,” the “thing-in-itself.” )

3. Becoming is of equivalent value every moment; the sum
of its values always remains the same; in other words, it has no

to see whether a scientific order of values could be constructed

“values” are prejudices, naiveties, misunderstandings.— They are
everywhere reducible to this numerical and mensural scale of force.
The ascent on this scale represents every rise in value; the descent
on this scale represents diminution in value.

moral values are only apparent values compared with physiologi­

preservation and enhancement for complex forms of relative lifeduration within the flux of becoming.
There are no durable ultimate units, no atoms, no monads:
here, too, “beings” are only introduced by us (from perspective
grounds of practicality and utility).
“Forms of domination” ; the sphere of that which is domi­
nated continually growing or periodically increasing and decreas­
ing according to the favorability or unfavorability of circumstances
(nourishment— ).
“Value” is essentially the standpoint for the increase or
decrease of these dominating centers ( “multiplicities” in any case;
but “units” are nowhere present in the nature of becoming).90
Linguistic means of expression are useless for expressing
“becoming”; it accords with our inevitable need to preserve our­
selves to posit a crude world of stability, of “things,” etc. We may
venture to speak of atoms and monads in a relative sense; and

III. THE WILL TO POWER AS
SOCIETY AND INDIVIDUAL
1. Society and State
716 (March-June 1888)
Basic principle: only individuals feel themselves responsible.
Multiplicities are invented in order to do things for which the
individual lacks the courage. It is for just this reason that all communalities and societies are a hundred times more upright and
instructive about the nature of man than is the individual, who
is too weak to have the courage for his own desires—
The whole of “altruism” reveals itself as the prudence of
the private man: societies are not “altruistic” towards one another—
The commandment to love one’s neighbor has never yet been
extended to include one’s actual neighbor* That relationship is
still governed by the words of Manu: “We must consider all coun­
tries that have common borders with us, and their allies, too, as
our enemies. For the same reason, we must count all their neigh­
bors as being well-disposed toward us.”
The study of society is so invaluable because man as society
is much more naive than man as a “unit.” ‘“Society” has never
regarded virtue as anything but a means to strength, power, and
order.
How simple and dignified is Mariu when he says: “Virtue
could scarcely endure by its own strength. Fundamentally it is
only the fear of punishment that keeps men within bounds and
leaves everyone in peaceful possession of his own,”92
717 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
The state organized immorality—internally: as police, penal
law, classes, commerce, family; externally: as will to power, to
war, to conquest, to revenge.
How does it happen that the state will do a host of things
that the individual would never countenance?— Through division
of responsibility, of command, and of execution. Through the
interposition of the virtues of obedience, duty, patriotism, and
" T h e tw o quotations— in the second and in the last paragraphs— were
inserted by Peter G ast.

book th re e :

383

loyalty. Through upholding pride, severity, strength, hatred, revenge
— in short, all typical characteristics that contradict the herd type.
718 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
None of you has the courage to kill a man, or even to whip
him, or even to— but the tremendous machine of the state over­
powers the individual, so he repudiates responsibility for what
he does (obedience, oath, etc.)
— Everything a man does in the service of the state is con­
trary to his nature.
— in the same way, everything he learns with a view to future
state service is contrary to his nature.
This is achieved through division of labor (so that no one
any longer possesses the full responsibility):
the lawgiver— and he who enacts the law;
the teacher of discipline— and those who have grown hard
and severe under discipline.
719 (Spring-Fall 1887)
A division of labor among the affects within society: so indi­
viduals and classes produce an incomplete, but for that reason more
useful kind of soul. To what extent certain affects have remained
almost rudimentary in every type within society (with a view to
developing another affect more strongly).
Justification of morality:
economic (the intention to exploit individual strength to
the greatest possible extent to prevent the squandering
of everything exceptional);
aesthetic (the formation of firm types, together with pleasure
in one’s own type);
political (the art of enduring the tremendous tension between
differing degrees of power);
physiological (as a pretended high evaluation in favor of the
underprivileged or mediocre— for the preservation of the
weak).
720 (1886-1887)
The most fearful and fundamental desire in man, bis drive

for power— this drive is called “freedom”— must be held in
check the longest. This is why ethics, with its unconscious instinct
for education and breeding, has hitherto aimed at holding the
desire for power in check: it disparages the tyrannical individual
and with its glorification of social welfare and patriotism emphasizes
the power-instinct of the herd.
721 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Inability to acquire power: its hypocrisy and shrewdness:
as obedience (subordination, pride in duty, morality— ); as sub­
mission, devotion, love (idealization, deification of him who
commands as compensation and indirect self-transfiguration); as
fatalism, resignation; as “objectivity” ; as self-tyranny (Stoicism,
asceticism, “emancipation from the self,” “sanctification” ); as
criticism, pessimism, indignation, torment; as “beautiful soul,”
“virtue,” “self-deification,” “detachment,” “unspotted by the
world,” etc, (— the insight into an inability to acquire power
disguised as dedain), In all this there is expressed the need to
exercise some sort of power nonetheless, or to create for one­
self the temporary appearance of power— as intoxication.
Men who want power for the sake of the happiness power
provides: political parties.
Other men who want power even accompanied by obvious
disadvantages and sacrifices in happiness and well-being: the
ambitious.
Other men who want power merely because it would other­
wise fall into other hands upon which they do not want to be
dependent.
722 (1886-1887)
Critique of “justice” and “equality before the law” : what is
really supposed to be abolished through this? Tension, enmity,
hatred,— But it is an error to suppose that “happiness” will be
increased in this way: Corsicans, e.g., enjoy more happiness
than Continentals.
723 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
Reciprocity, the hidden intention to claim reward: one of the

BOOK t h r e e :

385

most insidious forms of the diminution of the value of man. It
brings with it that “equality” which depreciates the distancing
gulf as immoral—
724 (Spring-Fall 1887 )
What “useful” means is entirely dependent upon the inten­
tion, the wherefore? The intention, the “goal,” is again entirely
dependent on the degree of power. Therefore utilitarianism is not
a foundation but only a theory of consequences, and absolutely
cannot be made obligatory for everyone.
725 (Summer-Fall 1883 )
Formerly one had the theory of the state as a calculating
utility: now one has the practice as well!— The age of kings is
past because the peoples are no longer worthy of them: they do
not want to see the symbol of their ideal in kings, but a means
for their profit.— That is the whole truth!
726 (Spring-Fall 1887 )
Attempt on my part to grasp the absolute rationality of
social judgment and evaluation (naturally without the desire to
deduce moral conclusions).
the degree of psychological falsity and opacity needed to
sanctify the affects essential for preservation and enhancement of
power (in order to create a good conscience for them).
the degree of stupidity needed to maintain the possibility of
common rules and valuations (in addition education, supervision
of the elements of culture, training).
the degree of inquisition, mistrust, and intolerance needed to
deal with the exceptions as criminals and to suppress them— to
give them a bad conscience, so they suffer dieir exceptionalness
as a disease.
727 {Spring-Fall 1887)
Morality essentially a shield, a means of defense; to this
extent a sign of the immature (armored, stoical).
The mature man has, above all, weapons: he attacks.

386

Instruments of war transformed into instruments of peace
(from scales and armor, feathers and hair).
728 ( March-June 1888)
It is part of the concept of the living that it must grow—
that it must extend its power and consequently incorporate alien
forces. Intoxicated by moral narcotics, one speaks of the right of
the individual to defend himself; in the same sense one might
also speak of his right to attack: for both— and the second even
more than the first— are necessities for every living thing:—
aggressive and defensive egoism are not matters of choice, to say
nothing of “free will,” but the fatality of life itself.
In this case it is all the same whether one has in view an
individual or a living body, an aspiring “society.” The right to
punish (or the self-defense of society) is at bottom called a
“right” owing to a misuse of the word. A right is acquired through
treaties—but self-protection and self-defense do not rest on the
basis of a treaty. At least a people might just as well designate
as a right its need to conquer, its lust for power, whether by
means of arms or by trade, commerce and colonization— the right
to growth, perhaps. A society that definitely and instinctively gives
up war and conquest is in decline: it is ripe for democracy and the
rule of shopkeepers— In most cases, to be sure, assurances of
peace are merely narcotics.
729 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
The maintenance of the military state is the last means of
all of acquiring or maintaining the great tradition with regard
to the supreme type of man, the strong type. And all concepts
that perpetuate enmity and difference in rank between states
(e.g., nationalism, protective tariffs) may appear sanctioned in
this light.
730 ( 1885-1886)
That something longer-lasting than an individual should
endure, that a work should endure which has perhaps been
created by an individual: to that end, every possible kind of limi­
tation, one-sidedness, etc., must be imposed upon the individual.

By what means? Love, reverence, gratitude toward the person who
created the work helps; or that our forefathers fought for it; or
that my descendants will be guaranteed only if I guarantee this
work (e.g., the polis). Morality is essentially the means of en­
suring the duration of something beyond individuals, or rather
through an enslavement of the individual. It is obvious that the
perspective from below will produce quite different expressions
from that from above.
A complex of power: how is it maintained? By the fact that
many generations sacrifice themselves for it; i.e.,— 03
731 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The continuum: “marriage, property, language, tradition,
tribe, family, people, state” are continuums of lower and higher
orders. Their economy resides in the preponderance of the advan­
tages of uninterrupted work and of multiplicity over the disadvan­
tages: the higher cost of exchange between parts or of making
them last. (Multiplication of the effective parts, which, however,
often remain unemployed; thus a higher cost of acquisition and a
not inconsiderable cost in maintenance.) The advantage resides in
the fact that interruptions are avoided and losses that would arise
from them are saved. Nothing is more costly than a beginning.
“The greater the advantages for existence, the greater the
cost of maintenance and production (food and propagation); the
greater, too, the danger and probability of perishing before the
high point is reached.”
732 (Summer-Fall 1888)
Marriage in the bourgeois sense of the word— I mean, in .the
most respectable sense of the word “marriage”— is not a matter
of love, any more than it is a question of money; no institution can
be founded on love. It is a question of society’s granting per­
mission to two people to gratify their sexual desires with one
another, under certain conditions, to be sure, but conditions that
keep the interests of society in view. It is obvious that a certain
attraction between the parties and very much good will— will to
patience, compatibility, care for one another—will be among the
presuppositions of such a contract; but one should not misuse the
” In all previous editions the section ends: “. . . for it.”

word love to describe this! For two lovers in the complete and
strong sense of the word sexual gratification is not essential and
is really no more than a symbol: for one party, as already said, a
symbol of unconditional submission, for the other a symbol of
assent to this, a sign of taking possession.
In marriage in the aristocratic, old aristocratic sense of the
word it was a question of the breeding of a race (is there still an
aristocracy today? Quaeritur94) — thus of the maintenance of a
fixed, definite type of ruling man: man and woman were sacri­
ficed to this point of view. It is obvious that love was not the
first consideration here; on the contrary! and not even that measure
of mutual good will that is a condition of the good bourgeois
marriage. What was decisive was the interest of a family, and
beyond that—the class. We would shiver a little at the coldness,
severity, and calculating clarity of such a noble concept of marriage
as has ruled in every healthy aristocracy, in ancient Athens as in
the eighteenth century, we warm-blooded animals with sensitive
hearts, we “modems” ! Precisely this is why love as a passion—in
the great meaning of the word— was invented for the aristocratic
world and in it, where constraint and privation were greatest05—
733 (1888)
On the future of marriage:— an additional tax (on inherit­
ance) , also additional war service for bachelors from a certain age
onwards and increasing (within the community);
advantages of all kinds for fathers who bring many boys into
the world: possibly a plural vote;
a medical certificate preceding every marriage and endorsed
by the communal authorities, several definite questions must be
answered by the couple and by doctors (“family history”— );
as an antidote to prostitution (or as its ennoblement):
marriages for a period, legalized (for years, for months), with
guarantees for the children;
every marriage warranted and sanctioned by a certain number
of trusted men of the community, as a matter of concern to the
community.90

734 (Summer-Fall 1888)
Also a commandment of the love of man.— There are cases
in which a child would be a crime: in the case of chronic invalids
and neurasthenics of the third degree. What should one do in
such cases?— One might at least try encouraging them to chastity,
perhaps with the aid of Parsifal music: Parsifal himself, this
typical idiot, had only too many reasons not to propagate him­
self. The trouble is that a certain inability to “control” oneself
(— not to react to stimuli, even to very slight sexual stimuli) is one
of the most regular consequences of general exhaustion. One
would be mistaken, for example, to think of a Leopardi as chaste.
The priest, the moralist play a hopeless game in such cases; it
would make more sense to go to a pharmacy. After all, society has
a duty here: few more pressing and fundamental demands can
be made upon it. Society, as the great trustee of life, is re­
sponsible to life itself for every miscarried life— it also has to
pay for such lives: consequently it ought to prevent them. In
numerous cases, society ought to prevent procreation: to this end,
it may hold in readiness, without regard to descent, rank, or
spirit, the most rigorous means of constraint, deprivation of free­
dom, in certain circumstances castration.—
The Biblical prohibition “thou shalt not kill!” is a piece of
naivete compared with the seriousness of the prohibition of life
to decadents: “thou shalt not procreate!”— Life itself recognizes
no solidarity, no “equal rights,” between the healthy and the
degenerate parts of an organism: one must excise the latter— or
the whole will perish.— Sympathy for decadents, equal rights for
the ill-constituted— that would be the profoundest immorality,
that would be antinature itself as morality!97

736 (Spring-Fall 1887)
In our civilized world, we learn to know almost only the
wretched criminal, crushed by the curse and the contempt of
society, mistrustful of himself, often belittling and slandering his
deed, a miscarried type of criminal; and we resist the idea that all
great human beings have been criminals (only in the grand and
not in a miserable style), that crime belongs to greatness (—for
that is the experience of those who have tried the reins and of
all who have descended deepest into great souls— ). To be “free
as a bird” from tradition, the conscience of duty— every great
human being knows this danger. But he also desires it: he desires
a great goal and therefore also the means to it.100
737 (March-June 1888)
Ages in which one leads men with reward and punishment
have a low, still primitive kind of man in view: it is as if they
were children—
Within our late culture, fatality and degeneration are some­
thing that completely abolishes all meaning of reward and punish­
ment— This real determination of action through reward and
punishment presupposes young, strong, forceful races. In old
races, the impulses are so irresistible that a mere idea is quite
powerless;—to be unable to offer resistance where a stimulus is
given, but to have to respond to it: this extreme susceptibility of
decadents renders such systems of punishment and improvement
perfectly meaningless.

in order not to have him as an enemy.
738 {Spring-Fall 1887)
Effect of a prohibition.— Every power that forbids, that
knows how to arouse fear in diose to whom something is forbidden,
creates a “bad conscience” (that is, the desire for something com­
bined with the consciousness of danger in satisfying it, with the
necessity for secrecy, for underhandedness, for caution). Every
prohibition worsens the character of those who do not submit to
it willingly, but only because they are compelled.
739 (March-June 1888)
“Reward and punishment.”— They stand together, they fall
together. Today one does not want to be rewarded, one will not
acknowledge the right of anyone to punish— One has put oneself
on a war footing: one desires something, one meets with opposi­
tion, one can perhaps gain what one wants most reasonably if one
gets along— if one draws up a contract.
A modem society, in which every individual has drawn up
his “contract”— the criminal breaks a contract— That would be
a clear concept. But then one could not tolerate within a society
anarchists and those who oppose the form of that society or
principle—
740 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Crime belongs to the concept “revolt against the social order.”
One does not “punish” a rebel; one suppresses him. A rebel can
be a miserable and contemptible man; but there is nothing con­
temptible in a revolt as such— and to be a rebel in view of con­
temporary society does not in itself lower the value of a man*
There are even cases in which one might have to honor a rebel,
because he finds something in our society against which war ought
to be waged— he awakens us from our slumber.
If a criminal perpetrates an individual act against an indi­
vidual this does not demonstrate that his whole instinct is not

in a state of war with the whole order: his deed as a mere symptom*
One should reduce the concept “punishment” to the concept:
suppression of a revolt, security measures against the suppressed
(total or partial imprisonment). But one should not express con­
tempt through punishment: a criminal is in any case a man who
risks his life, his honor, his freedom— a man of courage. Neither
should one take punishment to be a penance; or as a payment,
as if an exchange relationship existed between guilt and punish­
ment— punishment does not purify, for crime does not sully.
One should not deprive the criminal of the possibility of mak­
ing his peace with society; provided he does not belong to the
race of criminals. In that case one should make war on him even
before he has committed any hostile act (first operation as soon
as one has him in one’s power: his castration).
One should not hold against the criminal his bad manners
or the low level of his intelligence. Nothing is more common than
that he should misunderstand himself (for often his rebellious in­
stinct, the rancor of the declasse, has not reached consciousness,
faute le lecture),1**2 that he should slander and dishonor his deed
under the influence of fear and failure— quite apart from those
cases in which, psychologically speaking, the criminal surrenders
to an uncomprehended drive and by some subsidiary action ascribes
a false motive to his deed (perhaps by a robbery when what he
wanted was blood)*103
One should beware of assessing the value of a man according
to a single deed, Napoleon warned against this. For our haut-relief
deeds are quite especially insignificant. If men like us have no
crime, e.g., murder, on our conscience—why is it? Because a few
opportune circumstances were lacking. And if we did it, what
would that indicate about our value? In a way one would despise
us if one thought we had not the strength to kill a man under
certain circumstances. In almost all crimes some qualities also find
expression which ought not to be lacking in a man. It was not
without justification that Dostoevsky said of the inmates of his
Siberian prisons that they formed the strongest and most valuable

part of the Russian people.104 If with us the criminal is an illnourished and stunted plant, this is to the dishonor of our social
relationships; in the age of the Renaissance the criminal throve and
acquired for himself his own kind of virtue—virtue in the Ren­
aissance style, to be sure, virtu, moraline-free virtue.
One can enhance only those men whom one does not treat
with contempt; moral contempt causes greater indignity and harm
than any crime.
741 (1883-1888)
The derogatory element first entered into punishment when
certain penalties became associated with contemptible men (e.g.,
slaves). Those punished most were conteinptible men, and at length
punishment came to contain something derogatory.
742 (March-June 1888)
In ancient penal law a religious concept was at Work: that
of the expiatory {tower of punishment. Punishment purifies: in the
modern world it sullies. Punishment is a payment: one is really rid
of that for which one was willing to suffer so much. Provided there
is a belief in this power of punishment, there follows a profound
sense of relief which is really very close to a new health, a restora­
tion. One has not only made one’s peace with society again, one
has also regained one’s self-respect and feels— “pure.”
Today punishment isolates even more than the crime; the
fatality behind a crime has grown so great that it has grown in­
curable. One emerges from punishment as an enemy of society.
From then on, it has one more enemy.
Jus talionis105 can be dictated by the spirit of retribution (i.e.,
by a kind of moderation of the instinct for revenge); but with
Manu, e.g., it is the need to possess an equivalent in order to
expiate, in order to be “free” again in a religious sense.

codes is this: if the punishment should hurt in proportion to the
magnitude of the crime— and fundamentally that is what all of you
want!— you would have to measure the susceptibility to pain of
every criminal. Does that not mean: a previously determined
punishment for a crime, a penal code, ought not to exist at all?
But considering that one would scarcely be able to determine a
criminal’s degrees of pleasure and displeasure, wouldn’t one have
to do without punishment in practice? What a loss! Isn’t it? Con­
sequently-----744 ( 1883-1888)
Ah, the philosophy of right! A science that, like all moral
science, has not even reached the cradle yet!
One still misunderstands, e.g., even among jurists who think
themselves enlightened, the oldest and most valuable significance
of punishment—one does hot know it at all; and as long as juris­
prudence does not put itself on a new footing, namely on that of
comparative history and anthropology, it will persist in the useless
struggle between fundamentally false abstractions that today pass
for “philosophy of right” and that are all based on contemporary
man. This contemporary man, however, is so intricate, also in his
legal evaluations, that he permits the most varied interpretations.

Schopenhauer wanted rascals to be castrated and silly geese
to be shut up in convents: from what point of view would this
be desirable? The rascal has this advantage over many other men,
that he is not mediocre; and the fool has this advantage over us,
that he does not suffer at the sight of mediocrity.
It would be more desirable that the gulf should be made
wider; so rascality and folly should increase. In this way human
nature would be expanded— But, after all, this is dictated by ne­
cessity; it does not depend on whether we desire it or not. Folly,
rascality increase: that is part of “progress.”

747 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
In contemporary society a great deal of consideration, of tact
and forbearance, of good-natured respect for the rights of others,
even for the claims of others, is quite widespread; even more, a
certain benevolent instinctive estimation of human value in general,
which finds expression in trustfulness and credit of all kinds. Re­
spect for man— and not merely for virtuous men—is perhaps what
divides us most sharply from a Christian evaluation. It seems to us
ironic to a degree when we still hear morals preached; a man lowers
himself in our eyes and becomes comical if he preaches morals.
This moral liberality is one of the best signs of our age.
When we discover cases in which it is noticeably lacking, this
strikes us as a kind of sickness (the case of Carlyle in England,
the case of Ibsen in Norway, the case of Schopenhauerian[?]10fl
pessimism[?] throughout Europe[? ]). If anything can reconcile
us to our age, it is the great amount of immorality it permits itself
without thinking any the worse of itself. On the contrary! What
constitutes the superiority of culture over unculture? of the Renais­
sance over the Middle Ages, for example?— One thing alone; the
great amount of admitted immorality. From this it follows of
necessity what all the heights of human evolution must represent
to the eye of the moral fanatic: the non plus ultra of corruption
(— consider Savonarola’s judgment of Florence, Plato’s judgment
of Periclean Athens, Luther’s [?] judgment[?] of Rome, Rous­
seau’s judgment of Voltaire’s society, the German judgment contra
Goethe).

A little fresh air! This absurd condition of Europe shall not
go on much longer! Is there any idea at all behind this bovine
nationalism? What value can there be now, when everything points
to wider and more common interests, in encouraging this boorish
self-conceit? And this in a state of affairs in which spiritual de­
pendency and disnationalization meet the eye and in which the
value and meaning of contemporary culture lie in mutual blend­
ing and fertilization!— And the “new Reich” again founded on

Can do without our Support. We immoralists—we are today the
only power that needs no allies in order to conquer: thus we are
by far the strongest of the strong. We do not even need to tell
lies: what other power can dispense with that? A powerful seduc­
tion fights on our behalf, the most powerful perhaps that there has
ever been— the seduction of truth— “Truth”? Who has forced
this word on me? But I repudiate it; but I disdain this proud word:
no, we do not need even this; we shall conquer and come to power
even without truth. The spell that fights on our behalf, the eye of
Venus that charms and blinds even our opponents, is the magic of

immoralists— we are the most extreme.

The rotted ruling classes have ruined the image of the ruler.
The “state” as a court of law is a piece of cowardice, because the
great human being is lacking to provide a standard of measure­

“The will to power” is so hated in democratic ages that their
entire psychology seems directed toward belittling and defaming
it. The type of the great ambitious man who thirsts after honor is
supposed to be Napoleon! And Caesar! And Alexander!— As if
these were not precisely the great despisers of honor!
And Helvetius demonstrates to us that men strive after power
so as to possess the enjoyments available to the powerful: he
understands this striving for power as will to enjoyment! as hedon­
ism!

According to whether a people feels “right, vision, the gift
of leadership, etc., belong to the few” or “to the many”— there
will be an oligarchic or a democratic government.
Monarchy represents the belief in one man who is utterly
superior, a leader, savior, demigod.
Aristocracy represents the belief in an elite humanity and
higher caste.
Democracy represents the disbelief in great human beings and
an elite society: “Everyone is equal to everyone else.” “At bottom
we are one and all self-seeking cattle and mob.”

I am opposed to 1. socialism, because it dreams quite naively
of “the good, true, and beautiful” and of “equal rights” (— anarch­

How ludicrous I find the socialists, with their nonsensical
optimism concerning the “good m an /’ who is waiting to appear
from behind the scenes if only one would abolish the old “order”
and set all the “natural drives” free.
And the party opposed to them is just as ludicrous, because
it does not admit the element of violence in the law, the severity
and egoism in every kind of authority. “ ‘I and my kind’ want to
rule and survive; whoever degenerates will be expelled or de­
stroyed”— this is the basic feeling behind every ancient legislation.
The idea of a higher kind of man is hated more than monarchs. Anti-aristocratic: that assumes hatred of monarchy only as

“Redemption from all guilt”
One speaks of the “profound injustice” of the social pact; as
if the fact that this man is born in favorable circumstances, that
in unfavorable ones, were in itself an injustice; or even that it is
unjust that this man should be born with these qualities, that
man with those. Among the most honest of these opponents of
society it is asserted: “we ourselves, with all our bad, sick, crim­
inal qualities, which we admit to, are only the inescapable con­
sequences of a long suppression of the weak by the strong” ; they
make the ruling classes responsible for their characters. And they
threaten, they rage, they curse; they become virtuous from indig­
nation— they do not want to have become bad men, canaille, for
nothing.
This pose, an invention of the last few decades, is also called
pessimism, as I hear; the pessimism of indignation. Here the claim
is made to judge history, to divest it of its fatality, to discover
responsibility behind it, guilty men in it. For this is the rub: one
needs guilty men. The underprivileged, the decadents of all kinds
are in revolt on account of themselves and need victims so as not
to quench their thirst for destruction by destroying themselves
(—which would perhaps be reasonable). To this end, they need
an appearance of justice, i.e., a theory through which they can
shift the responsibility for their existence, for their being thus and
thus, on to some sort of scapegoat. This scapegoat can be God—•
in Russia there is no lack of such atheists from ressentiment— or
the social order, or education and training, or the Jews, or the
nobility, or those who have turned out well in any way. “It is a
crime to be bom in favorable circumstances; for thus one has
disinherited the others, pushed them aside, condemned them to vice,
even to work— How can I help it that I am wretched! But some­
body must be responsible, otherwise it would be unberablel”
In short, the pessimism of indignation invents responsibility
in order to create a pleasant feeling for itself— revenge— “Sweeter
than honey” old Homer called it.—
*

That such a theory is no longer rightly understood, that is
to say despised, is a consequence of the bit of Christianity that we

book t h r e e :

Principles of A New Evaluation

401

all still have in our blood; so we are tolerant toward things merely
because they smell somewhat Christian from a distance— The
socialists appeal to the Christian instincts, that is their most subtle
piece of shrewdness.
Christianity has accustomed us to the superstitious concept
of the “soul,” the “immortal soul,” soul-monads that really are at
home somewhere else and have only by chance fallen, as it were
into this or that condition, into the “earthly” and become “flesh” ;
but their essence is not held to be affected* to say nothing of being
conditioned, by all this. Social, family, historical circumstances are
for the soul only incidental* perhaps embarrassments; in any event,
it is not produced by them. With this idea, the individual is made
transcendent; as a result, he can attribute a senseless importance
to himself.
In fact, it was Christianity that first invited the individual to
play the judge of everything and everyone; megalomania almost
became a duty: one has to enforce eternal rights against everything
temporal and conditioned! What of the state! W hat of society! What
of historical laws! What of physiology! What speaks here is some­
thing beyond becoming, something unchanging throughout history,
something immortal, something divine: a soull
Another Christian concept, no less crazy, has passed even
more deeply into the tissue of modernity: the concept of the
“equality of souls before God.” This concept furnishes the proto­
type of all theories of equal rights: mankind was first taught to
stammer the proposition of equality in a religious context, and
only later was it made into morality: no wonder that man ended
by taking it seriously, taking it practically!— that is to say, politi­
cally, democratically, socialistically, in the spirit of the pessimism
of indignation.
*
Wherever responsibilities have been sought it was the instinct
of revenge that sought. This instinct of revenge has so mastered
mankind in the course of millennia that the whole of metaphysics,
psychology, conception of history, but above all morality, is im­
pregnated with it. As far as man has thought, he has introduced
the bacillus of revenge into things. He has made even God ill with
it, he has deprived existence in general of its innocence; namely,
by tracing back every state of being thus and thus to a will* an
intention, a responsible act. The entire doctrine of the will, this

402

THE

WILL

TO P O W E R

most fateful falsification in psychology hitherto, was essentially
invented for the sake of punishment. I t was the social utility of
punishment that guaranteed this concept its dignity, its power, its
truth. The originators of this psychology— the psychology of will
— are to be sought in the classes that administered the penal law,
above all among the priests at the head of the oldest communality:
they wanted to create for themselves a right to take revenge— they
wanted to create a right for God to take revenge. To this end, man
was conceived of as “free”; to this end, every action had to be
conceived of as willed, the origin of every action as conscious.
But these sentences refute the old psychology.111
Today, when Europe seems to have entered upon the opposite
course, when we halcyonians especially are trying with all our
might to withdraw, banish, and extinguish the concepts of guilt
and punishment from the world, when our most serious endeavor
is to purify psychology, morality, history; nature, social institutions
and sanctions, and even God of this filth— whom must We recognize
as our most natural antagonists? Precisely those apostles of revenge
and ressentiment, those pessimists from indignation par excellence,
who make it their mission to sanctify their filth under the name of
“indignation.”
We others, who desire to restore innocence to becoming,
would like to be the missionaries of a cleaner idea: that no one
has given man his qualities, neither God, nor society, nor his
parents and ancestors, nor he himself— that no one is to blame for
him.
There is no being that could be held responsible for the fact
that anyone exists at all, that anyone is thus and thus, that anyone
was born in certain circumstances, in a certain environment.— It
is a tremendous restorative that such a being is lacking.
We are not the result of an eternal intention, a will, a wish:
we are not the product of an attempt to achieve an “ideal of per­
fection” or an “ideal of happiness” or an “ideal of virtue”— any
more than we are a blunder on the part of God that must frighten
even him (an idea with which, ais is well known, the Old Testament
begins). There is no place, no purpose, no meaning, on which we
can shift the responsibility for our being, for our being thus and
thus. Above all: no one could do it; one cannot judge, measure,
compare the whole, to say nothing of denying it! Why not?— For

book t h r e e :

five reasons, all accessible even to modest intellects; for example,
because nothing exists besides the whole—
And, to say it again, this is a tremendous restorative; this
constitutes the innocence of all existence.112

2. The Individual
766 ( 1886-1887)
Basic error: to place the goal in the herd and not in single
individuals! The herd is a means, no more! But now one is at­
tempting to understand the herd as an individual and to ascribe
to it a higher rank than to the individual—profound misunder­
standing! ! ! Also to characterize that which makes herdlike,
Sympathy, as the more valuable side of our nature!
767 ( 1883-1888)
The individual is something quite new which creates new
things, something absolute; all his acts are entirely his own.
Ultimately, the individual derives the values of his acts from
himself; because he has to interpret in a quite individual way
even the words he has inherited. His interpretation of a formula
at least is personal, even if he does not create a formula: as an
interpreter he is still creative.
768 (1882)
The “ego” subdues and kills: it operates like an organic cell:
it is a robber and violent. It wants to regenerate itself—pregnancy.
It wants to give birth to its god and see all mankind at his feet.

as it can, and overwhelms what is weaker: thus it takes pleasure
in itself. The increasing “humanizing” of this tendency consists
in this, that there is an ever subtler sense of how hard it is really
to incorporate another: while a crude injury done him certainly
demonstrates our power over him, it at the same time estranges
his will from us even more— and thus makes him less easy to
subjugate.
770 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
The degreee of resistance that must be continually overcome
in order to remain on top is the measure of freedom, whether for
individuals or for societies— freedom understood, that is, as posi­
tive power, as will to power. According to this concept, the highest
form of individual freedom, of sovereignty, would in all probability
emerge not five steps from its opposite,1,3 where the danger of
slavery hangs over existence like a hundred swords of Damocles.
Look at history from this viewpoint: the ages in which the “indi­
vidual” achieves such ripe perfection, i.e., freedom, and the classic
type of the sovereign man is attained— oh no! they have never
been humane ages!
One must have no choice: either on top— or underneath, like
a worm, mocked, annihilated, trodden upon. One must oppose
tyrants to become a tyrant, i.e., free. It is no small advantage to
live under a hundred swords of Damocles: that way one learns to
dance, one attains “freedom of movement.”

Man, more than any animal, originally altruistic: hence his
slow development (child) and lofty culture; hence, too, his ex­

observer of all that in the human breast that derives from “habitual
selfishness,” and adds: “a noble spirit will be unable to convince
himself of the need to impose upon himself a constant contempla­
tion of commonness and baseness, unless it were to show over what
corrupting influences a lofty mind and nobility of character are able
to triumph.”

Morphology of self-esteem
First viewpoint: to what extent feelings of sympathy and
community are the lower* preparatory stage at a time when personal
self-esteem and individual initiative in evaluation are not yet
possible.
Second viewpoint: to what extent the height of collective self­
esteem, pride in the distinction of the clan, the feeling of inequality,
the aversion to mediation, equality of rights, reconciliation, is a
school for individual Self-reliance; that is, in SO far as it compels
the individual to represent the pride of the whole: he has to speak
and act with extreme respect for himself in S6 far is he represents
the community in his own person. Also when the individual feels
like the instrument and mouthpiece of the deity.
Third viewpoint: to what extent these forms of depersonaliza­
tion in fact give the person a tremendous importance, in so far
as higher powers employ him; religious awe before oneself the
condition of the prophet and poet.
Fourth Viewpoint: to what extent responsibility for the whole
trains the individual to, and permits him, a broad view, a stem and
terrible hand, a circumspection and coolness, a grandeur of bearGreat souls are not those with fewer passions and more virtues than
common souls, but only those with greater designs.—-The Mill quotation

ing and gesture, which he would not permit himself on his own
behalf.
In summa: collective self-esteem is the great preparatory school
for personal sovereignty. The noble class is that which inherits
this training.
774 (1883-1888)
The disguised forms of the will to power:
1. Desire for freedom, independence, also for equilibrium,
peace, co-ordination. Also the hermit, “spiritual freedom.” In the
lowest form: will to exist at all, “the drive to self-preservation.”
2. Enrollment, so as to satisfy the will to power in a larger
whole: submission, making oneself indispensable and useful to
those in power; love, as a secret path to the heart of the more
powerful— so as to dominate him.
3. The sense of duty, conscience, the imaginary consolation
of outranking those who actually possess power; the recognition
of an order of rank that permits judgment even of the more power­
ful; self-condemnation; the invention of new tables of value (Jews:
classical example ).
775 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Praise arid gratitude as will to power ^ — Praise and grati­
tude on the occasions of harvest, good weather, victory, marriage,
peace:— all these festivals require a subject upon which the feeling
can be discharged. One desires that all good things that happen to
one should have been done to one: one desires a doer. The same
applies to works of art: one is not satisfied with them alone: one
praises the doer.
What, then is praise? A sort of restoration of balance in
respect of benefits received, a giving in return, a demonstration of
our power— for those who praise affirm, judge, evaluate, pass
sentence: they claim the right of being able to affirm, of being
able to dispense honors. A heightened feeling of happiness and
life is also a heightened feeling of power: it is from this that man

On the “Machiavellianism” of Power
The will to power appears
a. among the oppressed, among slaves of all kinds, as will
to "freedom": merely getting free seems to be the goal (religiomorally: “responsible to one’s own conscience alone”; “evangelical
freedom,” etc.);
b. among a stronger kind of man, getting ready for power,
as will to overpower; if it is at first unsuccessful, then it limits
itself to the will to “justice,” i.e., to the same measure of rights
as the ruling type possesses;
c. among the strongest, richest, most independent, most
courageous, as “love of mankind,” of “the people,” of the gospel,
of truth, God; as sympathy; “self-sacrifice,” etc.; as overpowering,
bearing away with oneself> taking into one’s service, as instinctive
self-involvement with a great quantum of power to which one is
able to give direction: the hero, the prophet, the Caesar, the
savior, the shepherd; (— sexual love, too* belongs here: it desires
to overpower, to take possession, and it appears as self-surrender.
Fundamentally it is only love of one’s “instrument,” of one’s
“steed”— the conviction that this or that belongs to one because one
is in a position to use it).

"Senses,” “passions."— Fear of the senses, of the desires, of
the passions, when it goes so far as to counsel us against them, is
already a symptom of weakness: extreme measures always in­
dicate abnormal conditions. What is lacking, or crumbling, here
is the strength to restrain an impulse: if one’s instinct is to have
to succumb, i.e., to have to react, then one does well to avoid the
opportunities (“seductions” ) for it.
A “stimulation of the senses” is a seduction only for those
whose system is too easily moved and influenced: in the opposite
case, that of a system of great slowness and severity, strong stimuli
are needed to set the functions going.
Excess is a reproach only against those who have no right
to it; and almost all the passions have been brought into ill
repute on account of those who were not sufficiently strong to
employ them-r-.
One must understand that the same objections can be made to
the passions as are made to sickness: nonetheless— we cannot do
without sickness, and even less without the passions. We need
the abnormal, we give life a tremendous choc by these great sick­
nesses.
In detail, the following must be distinguished:
1. the dominating passion, which even brings with it the
supremest form of health; here the co-ordination of the inner
systems and their operation in the service of one end is best
achieved—but this is almost the definition of health!
2. the antagonism of the passions; two, three, a multiplicity
of “souls in one breast” :117 very unhealthy, inner ruin, disinte­
gration, betraying and increasing and inner conflict and anarchism
—unless one passion at last becomes master. Return to health—
3. juxtaposition without antagonism or collaboration: often
periodic, and then, as soon as an order has been established, also
healthy. The most interesting men, the chameleons, belong here;
they are not in contradiction with themselves, they are happy and
secure, but they do not develop— their differing states lie jux­
taposed, even if they are separated sevenfold. They change, they
do not become.

Preoccupation with itself and its ‘‘eternal salvation” is not
the expression of a rich and self-confident type; for that type does
not give a damn about its salvation— it has no such interest in
happiness of any kind; it is force, deed, desire— it imposes itself
upon things, it lays violent hands on things. Christianity is a ro­
mantic hypochondria of those whose legs are shaky.
Wherever the hedonistic perspective comes into the fore­
ground one may infer suffering and a type that represents a failure.

The “growing autonomy of the individual” : these Parisian
philosophers such as Fouillee speak of this; they ought to take a
look at the race moutonniere118 to which they belong! Open your
eyes, you sociologists of the future! The individual has grown
strong under opposite conditions; what you describe is the most
extreme weakening and impoverishment of mankind; you even de­
sire it and employ to that end the whole mendacious apparatus of
the old ideal! you are so constituted that you actually regard your
herd-animal needs as an ideal!
A complete lack of psychological integrity!

The modem European is characterized by two apparently
opposite traits: individualism and the demand for equal rights;
that I have at last come to understand. For the individual is an
extremely vulnerable piece of vanity: conscious of how easily it
suffers, this vanity demands that every other shall count as its
equal, that it should be only inter pares, In this way a social race
is characterized in which talents and powers do not diverge very
much. The pride that desires solitude and few admirers is quite
beyond comprehension; a really "great” success is possible only
through the masses, indeed one hardly grasps the fact any more

that a success with the masses is always really a petty success: be­
cause pulchrum est paucorum hominum.no
All moralities know nothing of an “order of rank” among
men; teachers of law nothing of a communal conscience. The prin­
ciple of the individual rejects very great human beings and de­
mands, among men approximately equal, the subtlest eye and the
speediest recognition of a talent; and because everyone has some
kind of talent in such late and civilized cultures— and therefore
can expect to receive back his share of honor— there is more flat­
tering of modest merits today than ever before: it gives the age a
veneer of boundless fairness. Its unfairness consists in a boundless
rage, not against tyrants and public flatterers even in the arts, but
against noble men, who despise the praise of the many. The demand
for equal rights (i.e., to be allowed to sit in judgment on every­
thing and everyone) is anti-aristocratic.
Equally strange to the age is the vanished individual, the
absorption in a great type, the desire not to be a personality—
which constituted the distinction and ambition of many lofty men
in earlier days (the greatest poets among them ); or “to be a city”
as in Greece; Jesuitism, Prussian officer corps and bureaucracy; or
to be a pupil and continuator of great masters— for which non­
social conditions and a lack of petty vanity are needed.
784 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
Individualism is a modest and still unconscious form of the
“will to power” ; here it seems sufficient to the individual to get
free from an overpowering domination by society (whether that
of the state or of the church). He does not oppose them as a
person but only as an individual; he represents all individuals
against the totality. That means: he instinctively posits himself as
equal to all other individuals; what he gains in this struggle he
gains for himself not as a person but as a representative of indi­
viduals against the totality.
Socialism is merely a means of agitation employed by indi­
vidualism: it grasps that, to attain anything, one must organize one­
self to a collective action, to a “power.” But what it desires is not
a social order as the goal of the individual but a social order as a
means for making possible many individuals: this is the instinct of
socialists about which they frequently deceive themselves (— apart

from the fact that, in order to prevail, they frequently have to
deceive themselves). The preaching of altruistic morality in the
service of individual egoism: one of the most common lies of the
nineteenth century.
Anarchism, too, is merely a means of agitation employed by
socialism; by means of it, socialism arouses fear, by means of fear
it begins to fascinate and to terrorize: above all— it draws the
courageous, the daring to its side, even in the most spiritual matters.
All this notwithstanding: individualism is the most modest
stage of the will to power.
*
Once one has achieved a certain degree of independence, one
wants more: people arrange themselves according to their degree
of force: the individual no longer simply supposes himself the
equal of others, he seeks his equals— he distinguishes himself from
others. Individualism is followed by the formation of groups and
organs; related tendencies join together and become active as a
power; between these centers of power friction, war, recognition
of one another’s forces, reciprocation, approaches, regulation of
an exchange of services. Finally, an order of rank.
N .B.:120
1. Individuals liberate themselves;
2. they enter into struggle with one another, they come to an
agreement over “equality of rights” (— “justice” as an aim— );
3. once this is achieved, the actual inequalities of force produce an enhanced effect (because peace rules on the whole
and many small quanta of force now constitute differences
that formerly did not count). Now individuals organize them­
selves in groups; the groups struggle for privileges and pre­
dominance. Strife breaks out again in a milder form.
One desires freedom so long as one does not possess power.
Once one does possess it, one desires to overpower; if one can­
not do that (if one is still too weak to do so), one desires “justice”
i.e., equal power.

single creature constitutes the entire process in its entire course
(not merely as “inherited,” but the process itself— ), then the
single creature acquires a tremendously great significance. Instinct
speaks quite correctly here. Where this instinct weakens— where
the individual seeks a value for himself only in the service of others,
one can be certain that exhaustion and degeneration are present.
An altruistic disposition, genuine and without tartuffery, is an
instinct for creating at least a secondary value for oneself in the
service of other egoisms. Usually, however, altruism is only appar­
ent; a detour to the preservation of one’s own feeling of vitality
and value.
786 (Spring-Fall 1887)
History of Moralization and Dismoralization
First proposition: There are no moral actions whatsoever:
they are completely imaginary. Not only are they indemonstrable
(which Kant, e.g., admitted, and Christianity as well)— they are
altogether impossible. Through a psychological misunderstanding,
one has invented an antithesis to the motivating forces, and be­
lieves one has described another kind of force; one has imagined a
primum mobile that does not exist at all. According to the valua­
tion that evolved the antithesis “moral” and “unmoral” in general,
one has to say: there are only immoral intentions and actions.
Second proposition: This entire distinction “moral” and “im­
moral” proceeds from the idea that moral as well as immoral actions
are acts arising from free spontaneity— in short, that such a spon­
taneity exists, or in other words: that moral judgments in general
relate only to one species of intentions and actions, those that are
free. But this whole species of intentions and actions is purely
imaginary; the world to which alone the moral standard can be
applied does not exist at all:— there are neither moral nor im­
moral actions.
*
The psychological error out of which the antithetical concepts
“moral” and “immoral” arose is: “selfless,” “unegoistic,” “selfdenying”— all unreal, imaginary.
False dogmatism regarding the “ego” : it is taken in an atom­
istic sense, in a false antithesis to the “non-ego” ; at the same time,
pried out of becoming, as something that is a being. The false sub-

414

stantialization of the ego: (in the faith in individual immortality)
this is made into an article of faith, especially under the influence
of religio-moral training. After this artificial separation of the ego,
and the declaration that it exists in and for itself, one confronted
a value antithesis that seemed irrefutable: the single ego and the
tremendous non-ego. It seemed evident that the value of the single
ego coiild lie only in relating itself to the tremendous “non-ego”—•
being subject to it and existing for its sake.— Here the herd in­
stincts were decisive: nothing is so contrary to this instinct as the
sovereignty of the individual. But if the ego is conceived as some­
thing in and for itself, then its value must lie in self-negation.
Thus: 1. the false autonomy of the “individual,” as atom;
2. the herd valuation, which abhors the desire to remain
an atom and regards it as hostile;
3. as a result: the individual overcome by moving his goal;
4. now there seemed to be actions that were self-negating: one
wove a whole sphere of fantastic antitheses about them;
5. one asked: in what actions does man affirm himself most
strongly? Around these (sexuality, avarice, lust to rule, cruelty,
etc.) prohibition, hatred, and contempt were heaped: one believed
there were unselfish drives, one condemned all the selfish ones,
one demanded the unselfish;
6. as a result: what had one done? One had placed a prohibi­
tion upon all the strongest, most natural, indeed the only real drives
— henceforth, in order to find an action praiseworthy, one had to
deny the presence in it of such drives;— tremendous falsification
in psychologicis. Even any kind of “self-satisfaction” had first
to be made possible by misunderstanding and construing oneself
sub specie boni. Conversely: that species that derived its advantage
from depriving man of his self-satisfaction (the representatives of
the herd instinct; e.g., the priests and philosophers) became subtle
and psychologically astute, so as to demonstrate how nonetheless
selfishness ruled everywhere. Christian conclusion: "Everything
is sin; even our virtues. Absolute reprehensibility of man. The
unselfish action is not possible.” Original sin. In short: once man
had made of his instincts an antithesis to a purely imaginary world
of the good, he ended by despising himself as incapable of per­
forming actions that were “good.”
N.B. Christianity thus demonstrates an advance in the sharpen­
ing of psychological insight: La Rochefoucauld and Pascal. It

grasped the essential equivalence of human actions and their
equivalence of value in essentials (— all immoral).
*
Now one seriously set about the task of forming men in whom
selfishness was dead:— priests, saints. And if one doubted the
possibility of becoming “perfect,” one did not doubt that one
knew what is perfect.
The psychology of the saint, the priest, the “good m an”
naturally had to be purely phantasmagorical. One had declared
the real motives of actions bad: in order still to be able to act at all,
to prescribe actions, one had to describe as possible and as it were
sanctify actions that are utterly impossible. With the falseness of
one’s former slanders, one now honored and idealized.
Rage against the instincts of life as “holy,” as venerable.
Absolute chastity, absolute obedience, absolute poverty: the priestly
ideal. Alms, pity, sacrifice,121 denial of beauty, of reason, of sen­
suality, a morose eye cast on all strong qualities one possessed:
the lay ideal.
*
One advances: the slandered instincts, too, try to create a
right for themselves (e.g., Luther’s Reformation: coarsest form
of moral mendaciousness under the guise of “evangelical freedom” )
— one rebaptized them with holy names;
the slandered instincts try to prove themselves necessary for
the existence of the virtuous instincts; one must vivre, pour vivre
pour autrui:122 egoism as means to an end;
one goes further, one tries to grant both the egoistic and the
altruistic impulses a right to exist: equal rights for the one as for
the other (from the standpoint of utility);
one goes further, one seeks a higher utility in a preference of
the egoistic viewpoint over the altruistic: more useful in relation
to the happiness of the majority or the progress of mankind, etc.
Thus: a preponderance of the rights of egoism, but under the per­
spective of extreme altruism (“collective utility for mankind” );
one tries to reconcile the altruistic mode of action with naturalness, one seeks altruism in the foundations of life; one seeks egoism

and altruism as equally founded in the essence of life and nature;
one dreams of a disappearance of the antithesis in some future,
when, owing to continual adaptation, egoism will at the same time
be altruism;
finally, one grasps that altruistic actions are only a species of
egoistic actions— and that the degree to which one loves, spends
oneself, proves the degree of individual power and personality.
In short, that when one makes men more evil, one makes them
better— and that one cannot be one without being the other— At
this point the curtain rises on the dreadful forgery of the psychol­
ogy of man hitherto,

Consequences: there are only immoral intentions and actions;
— the so-called moral ones must be shown to be immoral.123 The
derivation of all affects from the one will to power: the same
essence. The concept of life:— in the apparent antithesis (of
“good” and “evil” ) degrees of power in instinct express them­
selves, temporary orders of rank under which certain instincts
are held in check or taken into service.— Justification of morality:
economical, etc.
♦
Against the second propostion. Determinism: attempt to
rescue the moral world by transporting it— into the unknown.
Determinism is only a modus of permitting ourselves to juggle
our evaluations away once they have no place in a mechanistically
conceived world. One must therefore attack determinism and
undermine it: and also dispute our right to a distinction between
a world in itself and a phenomenal world.

To restore a good conscience to the evil man—has this been
my unconscious endeavor? I mean, to the evil man in so far as he
is the strong man? (Dostoevsky's judgment on the criminals in
prison should be cited here.)

Our new “freedom.”— What a feeling of freedom there is in
feeling as we freed spirits do, that we are not harnessed to any
system of “purposes”! Likewise, that the concepts “reward” and
“punishment” do not reside in the essence of things! Likewise, that
the good and the evil action cannot be called good and evil in
themselves, but only in the perspective of what tends to preserve
certain types of human communities! Likewise, that our assess­
ments of pleasure and pain have no cosmic, let alone a meta­
physical, significance! (— that pessimism, the pessimism of Herr
von Hartmann, who claims to put the pleasure and displeasure of
existence itself on the scales, with his arbitrary incarceration in the
pre-Copernican prison and field of vision, would be something
retarded and regressive unless it is merely a bad joke of a Berliner.)
790 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
Once one is clear about the “why?” of one’s life, one can
let its How? take care of itself. It is itself a sign of disbelief in a
Why, in purpose and meaning, a sign of a lack of will, if the value
of pleasure and displeasure step into the foreground and hedonisticpessimistic theories get a hearing; and renunciation, resignation,
virtue, and “objectivity” may at least be a sign that what matters
most is beginning to be defective.

Up to now there has not yet been any German culture. It is
no objection to this statement that there have been great hermits
in Germany (e.g., Goethe); for these had their own culture. But

the rest of what was German as by their antithesis— a soft, marshy,
insecure ground upon which every step from other countries made
an “impression” and created a “form” : German culture was a
thing without character, an almost limitless compliance.
792 (1885)
Germany, rich in clever and well-informed scholars, has
lacked great souls, mighty spirits, to such an extent and for so
long that it seems to have forgotten what a great soul, a mighty
spirit, is; and today mediocre and quite ill-constituted men place
themselves in the market square almost with a good conscience
and without any embarrassment and praise themselves as great
men and reformers, as, e.g., Eugen Diihring does— indeed a
clever and well-informed scholar, but one who nevertheless
betrays with almost every word he says that he harbors a petty
soul and is tormented by narrow, envious feelings; also that what
drives him is not a mighty, overflowing, benevolent, spendthrift
spirit—but ambition! But to lust after honors in this age is even
more unworthy of a philosopher than it was in any previous age:
today, when the mob rules, when the mob bestows the honors!

body, as organization (Prussian officer coips, Jesuit order). To
what extent the artist is only a preliminary stage.

which art appears in man like a force of nature and disposes of him
whether he will or no: as the compulsion to have visions and as
a compulsion to an orgiastic state. Both conditions are rehearsed
in ordinary life, too, but weaker: in dream and in intoxication.
But the same antithesis obtains between dream and intoxica­
tion: both release artistic powers in us, but different ones: the
dream those of vision, association, poetry; intoxication those of
gesture, passion, song, dance.
799 (March-June 1888)
In the Dionysian intoxication there is sexuality and volup­
tuousness: they are not lacking in the Apollinian. There must also
be a difference in tempo in the two conditions— The extreme
calm in certain sensations of intoxication (more strictly: the
retardation of the feelings of time and space) likes to be reflected
in a vision of the calmest gestures and types of soul. The classical
style is essentially a representation of this calm, simplification,
abbreviation, concentration— the highest feeling of power is con­
centrated in the classical type. To react slowly; a great con­
sciousness; no feeling of struggle.
800 (March-June 1888)
The feeling of intoxication, in fact corresponding to an in­
crease in strength; strongest in the mating season: new organs,
new accomplishments, colors, forms; “becoming more beautiful” is
a consequence of enhanced strength.127 Becoming more beautiful
as the expression of a victorious will, of increased co-ordination,
of a harmonizing of all the strong desires, of an infallibly per­
pendicular stress. Logical and geometrical simplification is a
consequence of enhancement of strength: conversely the apprehen­
sion of such a simplification again enhances the feeling of
strength— High point of the development: the grand style.
Ugliness signifies the decadence of a type, contradiction and
lack of co-ordination among the inner desires— signifies a decline in
organizing strength, in “will,” to speak psychologically.
The condition of pleasure called intoxication is precisely an

ing m ore beautiful as a necessary consequence o f the enhancem ent o f

exalted feeling of power— The sensations of space and time are
altered: tremendous distances are surveyed and, as it were, for the
first time apprehended; the extension of vision over greater masses
and expanses; the refinement of the organs for the apprehension
of much that is extremely small and fleeting; divination, the power
of understanding with only the least assistance, at the slightest
suggestion: “intelligent” sensuality—; strength as a feeling of
dominion in the muscles, as suppleness and pleasure in movement,
as dance, as levity and presto; strength as pleasure in the proof of
strength, as bravado, adventure, fearlessness, indifference to life
or death— All these climactic moments of life mutually stimulate
one another; the world of images and ideas of the one suffices as
a suggestion for the others:— in this way* states finally merge into
one another though they might perhaps have good reason to
remain apart. For example: the feeling of religious intoxication
and sexual excitation (— two profound feelings, co-ordinated to
an almost amazing degree. What pleases all pious women, old
or young? Answer: a saint with beautiful legs, still young, still
an idiot). Cruelty in tragedy and sympathy (— also normally co­
ordinated— ) Spring, dance, music:— all competitions between the
sexes— and even that Faustian “infinity in the breast.”
Artists, if they are any good, are (physically as well) strong,
full of surplus energy, powerful animals, sensual; without a certain
overheating of the sexual system a Raphael is unthinkable—
Making music is another way of making children; chastity is
merely the economy of an artist— and in any event, even with
artists fruitfulness ceases when potency ceases— Artists should
see nothing as it is, but fuller, simpler, stronger: to that end,
their lives must contain a kind of youth and spring, a kind of
habitual intoxication.
801 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
The states in which we infuse a transfiguration and fullness
into things and poetize about them until they reflect back our
fullness and joy in life: sexuality; intoxication; feasting; spring;
victory over an enemy, mockery; bravado; cruelty; the ecstacy of
religious feeling. Three elements principally: sexuality, intoxica­
tion, cruelty— all belonging to the oldest festal joys of mankind,
all also preponderate in the early “artist.”
Conversely, when we encounter things that display this trans­

422

THE

WILL

TO P O W E R

figuration and fullness, the animal responds with an excitation of
those spheres in which all those pleasurable states are situated—
and a blending of these very delicate nuances of animal well­
being and desires constitutes the aesthetic state. The latter appears
only in natures capable of that bestowing and overflowing fullness
of bodily vigor; it is this that is always the primum mobile. The
sober, the weary, the exhausted, the dried-up (e.g., scholars) can
receive absolutely nothing from art, because they do not possess
the primary artistic force, the pressure of abundance: whoever can­
not give, also receives nothing.
“Perfection” : in these states (in the case of sexual love
especially) there is naively revealed what the deepest instinct
recognizes as higher, more desirable, more valuable in gen­
eral, the upward movement of its type; also toward what status
it really aspires. Perfection: that is the extraordinary expansion
of its feeling of power, riches, necessary overflowing of all
limits.
802 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Art reminds us of states of animal vigor; it is on the one
hand an excess and overflow of blooming physicality into the
world of images and desires; on the other, an excitation of the
animal functions through the images and desires of intensified life;
— an enhancement of the feeling of life, a stimulant to it.
How can even ugliness possess this power? In so far as it
still communicates something of the artist’s victorious energy which
has become master of this ugliness and awfulness; or in so far as
it mildly excites in us the pleasure of cruelty (under certain con­
ditions even a desire to harm ourselves, self-violation— and thus
the feeling of power over ourselves).
803 (1883-1888)
“Beauty” is for the artist something outside all orders of
rank, because in beauty opposites are tamed; the highest sign of
power, namely power over opposites; moreover, without tension;
— that violence is no longer needed; that everything follows, obeys,
so easily and so pleasantly— that is what delights the artist’s will
to power.

804 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Origin of the beautiful and ugly.12S— Biological value of the
beautiful and the ugly.— That which is instinctively repugnant to
us, aesthetically, is proved by mankind’s longest experience to be
harmful, dangerous, worthy of suspicion: the suddenly vocal
aesthetic instinct (e.g., in disgust) contains a judgment. To this
extent the beautiful stands within the general category of the
biological values of what is useful, beneficent, life-enhancing—but
in such a way that a host of stimuli that are only distantly associated
with, and remind us only faintly of, useful things and states give
us the feeling of the beautiful, Le., of the increase of the feeling
of power (— not merely things, therefore, but also the sensations
that accompany such things, or symbols of them).
Thus the beautiful and the ugly are recognized as relative
to our most fundamental values of preservation. It is senseless
to want to posit anything as beautiful or ugly apart from this. The
beautiful exists just as little as does the good, or the true. In every
case it is a question of the conditions of preservation of a certain
type of man: thus the herd man will experience the value feeling
of the beautiful in the presence of different things than will the
exceptional or over-man.
It is the perspective of the foreground, which concerns itself
only with immediate consequences, from which the value of the
beautiful (also of the good, also of the true) arises.
All instinctive judgments are shortsighted in regard to the
chain of consequences: they advise what is to be done immediately.
The understanding is essentially a brake upon immediate reactions
on the basis of instinctive judgments: it retards, it considers, it
looks further along the chain of consequences.
Judgments concerning beauty and ugliness are shortsighted
(— they are always opposed by the understanding— ) but per­
suasive in the highest degree; they appeal to our instincts where
they decide most quickly and pronounce their Yes and No before
the understanding can speak.
The most habitual affirmations of beauty excite and stimulate
each other; once the aesthetic drive is at work, a whole host of
other perfections, originating elsewhere, crystallize around “the

particular instance of beauty.” It is not possible to remain objective,
or to suspend the interpretive, additive, interpolating, poetizing
power (— the latter is the forging of the chain of affirmations of
beauty). The sight of a “beautiful woman”—
Thus 1. the judgment of beauty is shortsighted, it sees only
the immediate consequences;
2.
it lavishes upon the object that inspires it a magic con­
ditioned by the association of various beauty judgments— that are
quite alien to the nature of that object. To experience a thing as
beautiful means: to experience it necessarily wrongly— (which,
incidentally, is why marriage for love is, from the point of view of
society, the most unreasonable kind of marriage).
805 (1883-1888)
On the genesis of art.— That making perfect, seeing as per­
fect, which characterizes the cerebral system bursting with sexual
energy (evening with the beloved, the smallest chance occurrences
transfigured, life a succession of sublime things, “the misfortune of
the unfortunate lover worth more than anything else” ) : on the
other hand, everything perfect and beautiful works as an un­
conscious reminder of that enamored condition and its way of
seeing— every perfection, all the beauty of things, revives through
contiguity12811 this aphrodisiac bliss. (Physiologically: the creative
instinct of the artist and the distribution of semen in his blood— )
The demand for art and beauty is an indirect demand for the
ecstasies of sexuality communicated to the brain. The world
become perfect, through “love”—
806 (1883-1888)
Sensuality in its disguises: (1) as idealism (“Plato” ), peculiar
to youth, creating the same kind of concave image that the beloved
in particuar assumes, imposing an encrustation, magnification,
transfiguration, infinity upon everything— ; (2) in the religion of
love: “a handsome young man, a beautiful woman,” somehow
divine, a bridegroom, a bride of the soul— ; (3) in art, as the
“embellishing” power: as man sees woman and, as it were, makes
her a present of everything excellent, so the sensuality of the
artist puts into one object everything else that he honors and
“** Nietzsche uses the English term, as in Genealogy III, section 4,

esteems— in this way he perfects an object (“idealizes” it). Woman,
conscious of man’s feelings concerning women, assists his efforts at
idealization by adorning herself, walking beautifully, dancing,
expressing delicate thoughts: in the same way, she practices
modesty, reserve, distance— realizing instinctively that in this
way the idealizing capacity of the man will grow. (—^Given the
tremendous subtlety of woman’s instinct, modesty remains by no
means conscious hypocrisy: she divines that it is precisely an
actual naive modesty that most seduces a man and impels him to
overestimate her. Therefore woman is naive— from the subtlety of
her instinct, which advises her of the utility of innocence. A
deliberate closing of one’s eyes to oneself— Wherever dissembling
produces a stronger effect when it is unconscious, it becomes
unconscious.)
807 (Sumrrier-Fall 1888)
What a tremendous amount can be accomplished by that
intoxication which is called “love” but which is yet something other
than love!— But everyone has his own knowledge of this. The
muscular strength of a girl increases as soon as a man comes into
her vicinity; there are instruments to measure this. When the
sexes aire in yet closer contact* as, e.g., at dances and other social
events, this strength is augmented to such a degree that real feats
of strength are possible: in the end one scarcely believes one’s
own eyes— or one’s watch. In such cases, to be sure, we must
reckon with the fact that dancing in itself, like every other swift
movement, brings with it a kind of intoxication of the whole
vascular, nervous, and muscular system. So one has to reckon
with the combined effects of a twofold intoxication.— And how
wise it is at times to be a little tipsy!
There are realities that one may never admit to oneself; after
all, one is a woman; after all, one has a woman’s pudeurs—
Those young creatures dancing over there are obviously beyond all
reality: they are dancing with nothing but palpable ideals; what is
more, they even see ideals sitting around them: the mothers!—
Opportunity to quote Faust— They look incomparably better
when they are a little tipsy like that, these pretty creatures— oh,

their third intoxication: they believe in their tailors as they believe
in their God— and who would dissuade them from this faith?
This faith makes blessed! And self-admiration is healthy! Selfadmiration protects against colds. Has a pretty woman who knew
herself to be well dressed ever caught cold? Never! I am even
assuming that she was barely dressed.129
808 (March-June 1888)
Do you desire the most astonishing proof of how far the
transfiguring power of intoxication can go?— “Love” Is this
proof: that which is called love in all the languages and silences
of the world. In this case* intoxication has done with reality to
such a degree that in the consciousness of the lover the cause of
it is extinguished and something else seems to have taken its
place— a vibration and glittering of all the magic mirrors of
Circe—
Here it makes no difference whether one is man or animal;
even less whether one has spirit, goodness, integrity. If one is
subtle, one is fooled subtly; if one is coarse, one is fooled coarsely;
but love, and even the love of God, the saintly love of “redeemed
souls,’’ remains the same in its roots: a fever that has good
reason to transfigure itself, an intoxication that does well to lie
about itself— And in any case, one lies well when one loves, about
oneself and to oneself: one seems to oneself transfigured, stronger,
richer, more perfect, one is more perfect-— Here we discover
art as an organic function: we discover it in the most angelic
instinct* “love” ; we discover it as the greatest stimulus of life— art
thus sublimely expedient even when it lies-—
But we should do wrong if we stopped with its power to
lie: it does more than merely imagine; it even transposes values.
And it is not only that it transposes the feeling of values: the lover
is more valuable* is stronger. In animals this condition produces
new weapons, pigments, colors, and forms; above all, new move­
ments, new rhythms, new love calls and seductions. It is no
different with man. His whole economy is richer than before,

more powerful, more complete than in those who do not love.
The lover becomes a squanderer: he is rich enough for it. Now he
dares, becomes an adventurer, becomes an ass in magnanimity
and innocence; he believes in God again, he believes in virtue,
because he believes in love; and on the other hand, this happy
idiot grows wings and new capabilities, and even the door of art is
opened to him. If we subtracted all traces of this intestinal fever
from lyricism in sound and word, what would be left of lyrical
poetry and music?— L ’art pour I’art perhaps: the virtuoso croaking
of shivering frogs, despairing in their swamp— All the rest Was
created by love—
809 (March-June 1888}
All art exercises the power of suggestion over the muscles
and senses, which in the artistic temperament are originally active:
it always speaks only to artists— it speaks to this kind of a subtle
flexibility of the body. The concept “layman” is an error. The deaf
man is not a species of the man with good hearing.
All art works tonically, increases strength, inflames desire
(i.e., the feeling of strength), excites all the more subtle recollec­
tions of intoxication—there is a special memory that penetrates
such states: a distant and transitory world of sensations here
comes back.
The ugly, i.e., the contradiction to art, that which is excluded
from art, its No— every time decline, impoverishment of life,
impotence, disintegration, degeneration are suggested even faintly,
the aesthetic man reacts with his No. The effect of the ugly is
depressing: it is the expression of a depression. It takes away
strength, it impoverishes, it weighs down—
The ugly suggests ugly things; one can use one’s states of
health to test how variously an indisposition increases the capacity
for imagining ugly things. The selection of things, interests, and
questions changes. A state closely related to the ugly is encountered
in logic, too: heaviness, dimness. Mechanically speaking, equilib­
rium is lacking: the ugly limps, the ugly stumbles: antithesis to
the divine frivolity of the dancer.
The aesthetic state possesses a superabundance of means of
communication, together with an extreme receptivity for stimuli
and signs. It constitutes the high point of communication and

transmission between living creatures— it is the source of languages.
This is where languages originate: the languages of tone as well
as the languages of gestures and glances. The more complete
phenomenon is always the beginning: our faculties are subtilized
out of more complete faculties. But even today one still hears with
one’s muscles, one even reads with one’s muscles.
Every mature art has a host of conventions as its basis— in
so far as it is a language. Convention is the condition of great
art, not an obstacle—
Every enhancement of life enhances man’s power of com­
munication, as well as his power of understanding. Empathy with
the souls of others is originally nothing moral, but a physiological
susceptibility to suggestion: “sympathy,” or what is called “altru­
ism,” is merely a product of that psychomotor rapport which is
reckoned a part of spirituality (induction psycho-motrice, Charles
F6re thinks). One never communicates thoughts: one communi­
cates movements, mimic signs, which we then trace back to
thoughts.
810 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Compared with music all communication by words is shame­
less; words dilute and brutalize; words depersonalize; words make
the uncommon common.
811 (March-June 1888)
It is exceptional states that condition the artist—all of them
profoundly related to and interlaced with morbid phenomena—
so it seems impossible to be an artist and not to be sick.
Physiological states that are in the artist as it were molded
into a “personality” and that characterize men in general to some
degree:
1. intoxication: the feeling of enhanced power; the inner need
to make of things a reflex of one’s own fullness and perfection;
2. the extreme sharpness of certain senses, so they under­
stand a quite different sign language— and create one— the con­
dition that seems to be a part of many nervous disorders— ;
extreme mobility that turns into an extreme urge to communicate;
the desire to speak on the part of everything that knows how to
make signs— ; a need to get rid of oneself, as it were, through signs

book t h r e e :

Principles of A New Evaluation

429

and gestures; ability to speak of oneself through a hundred speech
media— an explosive condition. One must first think of this con­
dition as a compulsion and urge to get rid of the exuberance of
inner tension through muscular activity and movements of all
kinds; then as an involuntary co-ordination between this move­
ment and the processes within (images, thoughts, desires)— as a
kind of automatism of the whole muscular system impelled by
strong stimuli from within—•; inability to prevent reaction; the
system of inhibitions suspended, as it were. Every inner move­
ment (feeling, thought, affect) is accompanied by vascular changes
and consequently by changes in color, temperature, and secretion.
The suggestive power of music, its “suggestion mentale”;—
3.
the compulsion to imitate: an extreme irritability through
which a given example becomes contagious— a state is divined on
the basis of signs and immediately enacted— An image, rising up
within, immediately turns into a movement of the limbs— a certain
suspension of the will— (Schopenhauer!!!) A kind of deafness
and blindness towards the external world— the realm of admitted
stimuli is sharply defined.
This is what distinguishes the artist from laymen (those
susceptible to a rt): the latter reach the high; point of their
susceptibility when they receive; the former as they give— so that
an antagonism between these two gifts is not only natural but
desirable. The perspectives of these two states are opposite: to
demand of the artist that he should practice the perspective of the
audience (of the critic— ) means to demand that he should
impoverish himself and his creative power— It is the same here
as with the difference between the sexes: one ought not to demand
of the artist, who gives, that he should become a woman— that
he should receive.
Our aesthetics hitherto has been a woman’s aesthetics to the
extent that only the receivers of art have formulated their ex­
perience of “what is beautiful?” In all philosophy hitherto the
artist is lacking—
This, as the foregoing indicates, is a necessary mistake;
for the artist who began to understand himself would misunder­
stand himself: he ought not to look back, he ought not to look
at all, he ought to give.—
It is to the honor of an artist if he is unable to be a critic—
otherwise he is half and half, he is “modern.”

430

THE

WILL

TO P O W E R

812 {March-June 1888)
I set down here a list of psychological; states as signs of a
full and flourishing life that one is accustomed today to Condemn
as morbid. For by now we have learned better than to speak of
healthy and sick as of an antithesis: it is a question of degrees.
My claim in this matter is that what is today called “healthy”
represents a lower level than that which under favorable circum­
stances would be healthy—that we are relatively sick—
The artist belongs to a still stronger race. What would be
harmful and morbid in us* in him is nature------- But one objects
to us that it is precisely the impoverishment of the machine that
makes possible extravagant powers of understanding of every kind
of suggestion: witness our hysterical females.
An excess of sap and force can bring with it symptoms of
partial constraint, of sense hallucinations, Susceptibility to sugges­
tion, just as well as can impoverishment of life: the stimulus is
differently conditioned, the effect remains the same— But the after­
effect is not the same; the extreme exhaustion of all morbid natures
after their nervous eccentricities has nothing in common with the
states of the artist, who does not have to atone for his good
periods— He is rich enough for them: he is able to squander with­
out becoming poor.
As one may today consider “genius” as a form of neurosis,
so perhaps also the artistic power of suggestion— and indeed our
artists are painfully like hysterical females!!! But that is an objec­
tion to “today,” not to “artists.”
Inartistic states: those of objectivity, mirroring, suspended
will— (Schopenhauer’s scandalous misunderstanding when he took
art for a bridge to the denial of life)— Inartistic states: among
those who become impoverished, withdraw, grow pale, under
whose eyes life suffers:— the Christian.
813 (1888)
The modem artist, in his physiology next-of-kin to the hys­
teric, is also distinguished by this morbidity as a character. The
hysteric is false— he lies from love of lying, he is admirable in
every art of dissimulation— unless his morbid vanity plays a trick

book t h r e e :

on him. This vanity is like a continual fever that requires nar­
cotics and does not shrink from any self-deception, any farce, that
promises momentary relief. (Incapacity for pride and the continual
need for revenge for a deeply ingrained self-contempt— this is
almost the definition of this kind of vanity.)
The absurd irritability of his system, which turns all expe­
riences into crises and introduces the “dramatic” into the smallest
accidents of life, robs him of all calculability: he is no longer a
person, at most a rendezvous of persons and now this one, now
that one shoots forward with shameless assurance. Precisely for this
reason, he is great as an actor: all these poor will-less people
whom doctors study so closely astonish one with their virtuosity
in mimicry, transfiguration, assumption of almost any desired
character.
814 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
Artists are not men Of great passion, whatever they may like
to tell us and themselves. And this for two reasons: they lack any
sense of shame before themselves (they observe themselves while
they live; they spy on themselves, they are too inquisitive) and
they also lack any sense of shame before great passion (they
exploit it as artists). Secondly, however, their vampire, their talent,
grudges them as a rule that squandering of force which one calls
passion.— If one has a talent, one is also its victim: one lives
under the vampirism of One’s talent.
One does not get over a passion by representing it: rather,
it is over when one is able to represent it. (Goethe teaches other­
wise; but here it seems that he wanted to misunderstand himself—
from delicatezza,1S0)
815 (Summer-Fall 1888)
The rationale of life.— A relative chastity, a prudent caution
on principle regarding erotic matters, even in thought, can belong
to the grand rationale of life even in richly endowed and complete
natures. This principle applies especially to artists, it is part of their
best wisdom of life. Completely non-suspect voices have lent sup,3* D e lic a c y o f feelin g, tact— consideration fo r the w o m en w h o had

port to this opinion: I name Stendhal and Th. Gautier, also
Flaubert. The artist is perhaps necessarily a sensual man, generally
excitable, susceptible in every sense to stimuli, meeting the very
suggestion of a stimulus halfway even from afar. This notwith­
standing, he is on the average, under the pressure of his task, of
his will to mastery, actually moderate, often even chaste. His
dominant instinct demands this of him: it does not permit him to
expend himself in any casual way. The force that one expends in
artistic conception is the same as that expended in the sexual act:
there is only one kind of force. An artist betrays himself if he
succumbs here, if he squanders himself here: it betrays a lack of
instinct, of will in general; it can be a sign of decadence-—in any
case, it devalues his art to an incalculable degree.131
816 (March-June 1888)
Compared with the artist, the appearance of the scientific
man is actually a sign of a certain damming-up and lowering of
the level of life (•—but also of strengthening, severity, hardness,
will power),
To what extent falsity, indifference to truth and utility may be
signs of youth, of “childishness,” in an artist— Their habitual
manner, their unreasonableness, their ignorance about themselves,
their indifference to “eternal values,” their seriousness in “play”—
their lack of dignity; buffoon and god side by side; saint and
canaille— Imitation as an instinct, commanding.— Artists of
ascending life— artists of declining life: do they not belong to all
phases?— Yes!132
817 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
Would any link at all be missing in the chain of art and
science if woman, if the works of women were missing? Admitting
exceptions— they prove the rule— woman attains perfection in
everything that is not a work: in letters, in memoirs, even in the
most delicate handiwork, in short in everything that is not a

metier—precisely because in these things she perfects herself, be­
cause she here obeys the only artistic impulse she has— she wants
to please—
But what has woman to do with the passionate indifference
of the true artist, who assigns more importance to a sound, a
breath, a heyday!188 than to himself? who strains with every finger
to reach his innermost secrets? who accords no value to anything
that cannot become form (—that cannot surrender itself, make
itself public— ). Art as it is practiced by the artist-—do you not
grasp what it is: an attempt to assassinate all pttdeurs718i
Only in this century has woman ventured to turn to literature
(— vers la canaille plumiere ecrivassiere,135 in the words of old
M irabeau); she dabbles in writing, she dabbles in art, she is los­
ing her instincts. But why! if one may ask.
818 (Nov. 1 8 8 7 -M a m 1888)
One is an artist at the cost O f regarding that which all non­
artists call “form” as content, as “the matter itself.” To be sure,
then one belongs in a topsy-turvy world: for henceforth content
becomes something merely formal— our life included.
819 (1883-1888)
A sense for and a delight in nuances (— the real mark of
modernity), in that which is not general, runs counter to the
drive that delights and excels in grasping the typical: like the
Greek taste of the best period. There is an overpowering of the
fullness of life in it; measure becomes master; at bottom there is
that calm of the strong soul that moves slowly and feels repug­
nance toward what is too lively. The general rule, the law, is
honored and emphasized: the exception, conversely, is set aside,
the nuance obliterated. The firm, powerful, solid, the life that
reposes broad and majestic and conceals its strength— that is what
“pleases”; i.e., that corresponds to what one thinks of oneself.

In the main, I agree more with the artists than with any
philosopher hitherto: they have not lost the scent of life* they
have loved the things of “this world”— they have loved their senses.
To strive for “desensualization” : that seems to me a misunderstand­
ing or an illness or a cure, where it is not merely hypocrisy or
self-deception. I desire for myself and for all who live, may live,
without being tormented by a puritanical conscience, an evergreater spiritualization and multiplication of the senses; indeed,
we should be grateful to the senses for their subtlety, plenitude,
and power and offer them in return the best we have in the way
of spirit. What are priestly and metaphysical calumnies against
the senses to us! We no longer need these calumnies: it is a sign
that one has turned out well when, like Goethe, one clings with
ever-greater pleasure and warmth to the “things of this world” :—
for in this way he holds firmly to the great conception of man,
that man becomes the transfigurer of existence when he learns to
transfigure himself.1®8
821 (March-June 1888)
Pessimism in art?— The artist gradually comes to love for
their own sake the means that reveal a condition of intoxication:
extreme subtlety and splendor of color, definiteness of line, nuances
of tone: the distinct where otherwise, under normal conditions,
distinctness is lacking. All distinct things, all nuances, to the extent
that they recall these extreme enhancements of strength that intoxi­
cation produces, awaken this feeling of intoxication by association:
the effect of works of art is to excite the state that creates art—
intoxication.
What is essential in art remains its perfection of existence, its
production of perfection and plenitude; art is essentially affirma­
tion, blessing, deification of existence— W hat does a pessimistic
art signify? Is it not a contradiction— Yes.— Schopenhauer is
wrong when he says that certain works of art serve pessimism.
Tragedy does not teach “resignation”— To represent terrible and
questionable things is in itself an instinct for power arid magnifiM S not in N ietzsche’s handw riting— evid en tly dictated b y him — but

cence in an artist: he does not fear them— There is no such thing
as pessimistic art— Art affirms. Job affirms.— But Zola? But the
Goncourts?— The things they display are ugly: but that they dis­
play them comes from their pleasure in the ugly— It’s no good!
If you think otherwise, you’re deceiving yourselves.— How liberat­
ing is Dostoevsky!
822 (1888)
If my readers are sufficiently initiated into the idea that “the
good man” represents, in the total drama of life, a form of exhaus­
tion, they will respect the consistency of Christianity in conceiving
the good man as ugly. Christianity was right in this.
For a philosopher to say, “the good and the beautiful are
one,” is infamy; if he goes on to add, “also the true,” one ought
to thrash him. Truth is ugly.
We possess art lest we perish of the truth.

narrowness and cOrner-pefspectives; or as mockery of them. Flight

First: one seeks for oneself a less artistic public, which loves
unconditionally ( —and soon kneels down before the
person). The superstition of our century, the superstitious
belief in the “genius,” helps.
Second: one harangues the obscure instincts of the dissatis­
fied, ambitious, self-disguised spirits in a democratic age:
importance of poses.
Third; one transfers the procedures of one art to the other
arts, confounds the objectives of art with those of knowl­
edge or the church or racial interests (nationalism) or
philosophy— one pulls all the stops at once and awakens
the dark suspicion that one may be a god.
Fourth: one flatters women, sufferers, the indignant, one
makes narcotics and opiates dominant in art, too. One
tickles the cultured, readers of poets and ancient stories.
825 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The division into “public hall” and “private chamber”; in the
former one has to be a charlatan today, in the latter one is deter­
mined to be a virtuoso and nothing more! The specific “genius”
of our century spans this division, is great in both: the great
charlatanry of Victor Hugo and Richard Wagner, but coupled
with so much genuine virtuosity that they satisfied even the most
refined artistic connoisseurs. Hence their lack of greatness: their
perspective was continually changing, now directed to the coarsest
demands, now to the most refined.

Modern art as an art of tyrannizing------- A coarse and
strongly defined logic of delineation; motifs simplified to the point
of formulas; the formula tyrannizes. Within the delineations a
wild multiplicity, an overwhelming mass, before which the senses
become confused; brutality in color, material, desires* Examples:
Zola, Wagner; in a more spiritual order, Taine. Thus: logic, mass
and brutality.

psychologists, theatrical producers of this or that recollection or
theory. They enjoy our erudition, our philosophy. Like us, they
are full and overfull of general ideas. They like a form, not for
the sake of what it is, but for the sake of what it expresses. They
are sons of a scholarly, tormented, and reflective generation— a
thousand miles removed from the old masters, who did not read
and only thought of feasting their eyes.

The intuition of yet more distant, unexplored worlds; dis­

Romantic musicians relate what exotic books have made of

the Florentine and Venetian taste: in the end one contents one­

a makeshift substitute for a defective “reality.”

If one understands by artistic genius the greatest freedom

Offenbach has even more right to the name “genius” than Wagner.
Wagner is heavy and ponderous: nothing is more foreign to him

buffoon Offenbach achieves five or six times in almost every one
of his buffooneries.143 But perhaps one might understand some­

On our modern music.— The decay of melody is the same as
the decay of the “idea,” of dialectic, of freedom of the most spirit­
ual activity— a piece of clumsiness and constipation that is develop­
ing to new heights of daring and even to principles;— finally* one
has only the principles of one’s talents, one’s narrowmindedness
of a talent.
“Dramatic music” nonsense! It is simply bad music— “Feel­
ing,” “passion” as surrogates when one no longer knows how to
achieve an exalted spirituality and the happiness that attends it
(e.g., that of Voltaire). Technically, “feeling” and “passion” are
easier—they presuppose much poorer artists. Recourse to drama
betrays that an artist is more a master of false means than of
genuine means. We have dramatic painting, dramatic lyrics, etc.

musicians and give them a conscience; we lack, as a consequence,

a genuine conflict over “principles”— for as musicians we laugh at
Herbart’s velleities in this realm as much as we do at Schopen­
hauer’s. In fact, this results in a great difficulty: we no longer
know on what basis to found the concepts “model,” “mastery,”
“perfection”— we grope blindly in the realm of values with the
instinct of old love and admiration; we come close to believing
“what is good is what pleases us"—
It awakens my mistrust when Beethoven is everywhere quite
innocently described as a “classicist” : I would strictly maintain
that in the other arts one understands by a classicist an artist of
the opposite type of Beethoven’s. But when even the complete and
obvious disintegration of style in Wagner, his so-called dramatic
style, is taught and honored as “exemplary,” as “mastery,” as
"progress,” my impatience reaches its height. The dramatic style
in music, as Wagner understands it, is the renunciation of style in
general, on the presupposition that something else is a hundred
times more important than music, namely the drama. Wagner can
paint, he employs music for something other than music, he empha­
sizes poses, he is a poet; finally, he appealed to “beautiful feelings”
and “heaving bosoms” like all artists of the theater— and with
all this he won over the women and even those in need of culture:
but what is music to women and those in need of culture! They
have no conscience for art; they do not suffer when all the princi­
pal and most indispensable virtues of an art are trampled under foot
and mocked for the benefit of secondary objectives (as ancilla148
dramaturgica) . What is the point of extending the means of expres­
sion if that which expresses, art itself, has lost the law of its being!
The picturesque pomp and power of tones, the symbolism of
sound, rhythm, colors of harmony and disharmony, the suggestive
significance of music, the whole sensuality of music which Wagner
has brought into dominance— all this Wagner recognized in music,
drew out of it, developed. Victor Hugo did something similar to
language; but already today the French are asking themselves
whether, in Hugo’s case, it was not a corruption of language—
whether, with the increase of sensuality in language, reason, spirit­
uality, the profound obedience to law in language have not been de­
pressed? That the poets in France have become sculptors, that the
musicians in Germany have become actors and culture-mongers—
are these not signs of decadence?

Today we have a musical pessimism, even among the non­
musical. Who has not met him, who has not cursed him— the
wretched youth who tortures his piano into cries of despair, who
single-handed heaves forward the mud of the gloomiest gray-brown
harmonies? This identifies one as a pessimist— But whether this
also identifies one as a musician? I cannot be made to think so.
The Wagnerian pur sang140 is unmusical; he succumbs to the ele­
mental powers of music somewhat as a woman succumbs to the
will of her hypnotist— and in order to be able to do this, he must
not be made suspicious by a severe and subtle conscience in rebus
musicis et musicantibus.150 I said “somewhat as”— : but perhaps
we have more than a metaphor here. Consider the means for pro­
ducing effects that Wagner prefers to use (— and had for the most
part to invent for himself): they are strangely similar to those
with which a hypnotist achieves his effect (— his choice of tempo
and tonal color for his orchestra; the repellent avoidance of logic
and squareness in his rhythm; the lingering, soothing, mysterious,
hysterical quality of his “endless melody” ).— And is the condi­
tion to which the Lohengrin prelude, for example, reduces its hear­
ers, especially women, essentially different from a somnambulistic
trance?—
I heard an Italian woman who had just listened to the prelude
in question say, with those entranced eyes that Wagneriennes know
how to affect: “come si dorme con questa musical”1*1

Religion in music.— How much unadmitted and even un­
comprehended satisfaction of all religious needs is still to be found
in Wagnerian music! How much prayer, virtue, unction, “virginity,”
“redemption” speak through it!— That music may dispense with
words and concepts— oh what advantage she derives from that fact,
this cunning saint, who leads and seduces back to all that was foru*Ot pure blood.

merly believed!— Our intellectual conscience has no need to feel
ashamed—it remains outside— when some ancient instinct or other
drinks with trembling lips from forbidden cups— This is shrewd,
healthy and, in so far as it betrays shame at the satisfaction of the
religious instinct, even a good sign— Underhand Christianity: type
of the music of “Wagner’s final period.”
841 ( March-June 1888)152
I distinguish between courage in the face of people, courage in
the face of things, and courage in the face of paper. The latter
was, e.g., the courage of David Strauss. I distinguish further be­
tween courage before witnesses and courage without witnesses: the
courage of a Christian, of a believer in God in general, can never
be courage without witnesses— this fact alone degrades it. I dis­
tinguish, finally, courage rooted in temperament and courage rooted
in fear of fear: a particular instance of the latter type is moral
courage. There should also be added courage from despair.'
Wagner possessed this kind of courage. His situtaion regard­
ing music was, at bottom, desperate. He lacked the two things
needed to make a good musician: nature and culture, a predis­
position toward music and training and schooling in music. He
possessed courage: he made a principle of what he lacked— he
invented a style of music for himself. “Dramatic music,” as in­
vented by him, is the music he was capable of making—Wagner’s
limitations define this concept.
And he was misunderstood!— Was he misunderstood?—
Five-sixths of modern artists are in this position. Wagner is their
savior; five-sixths is in any case the “lowest estimate.” In eveiy
instance in which nature has shown herself inexorable and in
which on the other hand culture has remained accidental, tenta­
tive, dilettante, the artist turns instinctively— what am I saying?—
enthusiastically to Wagner: “half did he drag him, half he sank,”
as the poet says.153

cannot be measured by the “beautiful feelings” he arouses: leave
that idea to females. But according to the degree to which he
approaches the grand style, to which he is capable of the grand
style. This style has this in common with great passion, that it
disdains to please; that it forgets to persuade; that it commands;
that it wills— To become master of the chaos one is; to compel
one’s chaos to become form: to become logical, simple, unam­
biguous, mathematics, law— that is the grand ambition here.— It
repels; such men of force are no longer loved— a desert spreads
around them, a silence, a fear as in the presence of some great
sacrilege— All the arts know such aspirants to the grand style:
why are they lacking in music? No musician has yet built as that
architect did who created the Palazzo Pitti— Here lies a problem.
Does music perhaps belong to that culture in which the domain
of men of force of all kinds has ceased? Does the concept grand
style ultimately stand in contradiction to the soul of music— to
the “woman” in our music?—
I here touch upon a cardinal question: where does our entire
music belong? The ages of classical taste knew nothing to com­
pare with it: it began to blossom when the Renaissance world
had attained its evening, when “freedom” had departed from
morals and even from men:— is it part of its character to be
counter-Renaissance? Is it the sister of the Baroque style, since
it is in any case its contemporary? Is music, modern music, not
already decadence?—
Once before I pointed to this question: whether our music is
not a piece of counter-Renaissance in art? whether it is not nextof-kin to the Baroque style? whether it has not grown up in con­
tradiction to all classical taste, so that all ambitions to become
classical are forbidden to it by its nature?
The answer to this first-rank question of values would not
remain in doubt if the proper inferences had been drawn from the
fact that music achieved its greatest ripeness and fullness as roman­
ticism— once again as a movement of reaction against classicism.
Mozart— a delicate and amorous soul, but entirely eighteenth
century, even when he is serious,— Beethoven the first great
romantic, in the sense of the French conception of romanticism,
as Wagner is the last great romantic— both instinctive opponents
of classical taste, of severe style— to say nothing of “grand” style.

Romanticism: an ambiguous question, like everything modem.
The aesthetic states twofold.
The full and bestowing as opposed to the seeking, desiring.
844 ( 1885-1886)
A romantic is an artist whose great dissatisfaction with him­
self makes him creative— who looks away, looks back from him­
self and from his world.
845 ( 1885-1886)
Is art a consequence of dissatisfaction with reality? O r an
expression of gratitude for happiness enjoyed! In the former case,
romanticism; in the latter, aureole and dithyramb (in short, art of
apotheosis): Raphael, too, belongs here; he merely had the falsity
to deify what looked like the Christian interpretation of the world.
He was grateful for existence where it was not specifically Christian.
The moral interpretation makes the world unbearable. Chris­
tianity was the attempt to “overcome” the world by it; i.e., to
negate it. In praxi, such a murderous attempt of insanity— an
insane self-elevation of man above the world—resulted in making
man gloomy, small, and impoverished: only the most mediocre
and harmless type of man, the herd type, profited by it, was
advanced by it, if you like.
Homer as an artist of apotheosis', Rubens also. Music has not
yet had one.
The idealization of the man of great sacrilege (a sense of his
greatness) is Greek;154 depreciation, slandering, contempt for the
sinner is Judeo-Christian.

first sight, another distinction might seem more plausible— it is
far more obvious— namely the distinction whether the desire for
rigidity, eternity, “being” has been the cause of creation, or rather
the desire for destruction, for change, for becoming. But both
kinds of desire prove, when examined more closely, to be ambigu­
ous arid interpretable according to the scheme mentioned above,
which, I think, is to be preferred.
The desire for destruction, change, becoming can be the
expression of an overfull power pregnant with the future (my term
for this, as is known, is the word “Dionysian” ); but it can also
be the hatred of the ill-constituted, disinherited, underprivileged,
which destroys, has to destroy, because what exists, indeed exist­
ence itself, all being itself, enrages and provokes it.
“Eternalization,” on the other hand, can proceed from grati­
tude and love— an art of this origin will always be an art of
apotheosis, dithyrambic perhaps with Rubens, blissful with Hafiz,
bright and gracious with Goethe, and shedding a Homeric aureole
over all things— but it can also be that tyrannic will of a great
sufferer who would like to forge what is most personal, individual,
and narrow— most idiosyncratic— in his suffering, into a binding
law and compulsion, taking revenge on all things, as it were, by
impressing, forcing, and branding into them his image, the image
of his torture. The latter is romantic pessimism in its most expres­
sive form, whether as Schopenhauerian philosophy of will or as
Wagnerian music.155

perhaps whether moral prejudices are not playing their game here
and whether great moral loftiness is not perhaps in itself a contra­
diction of the classical?156— Whether the moral monsters must
not necessarily be romantics, in word and deed?— Precisely such
a preponderance of one virtue over the others (as in the case of
a moral monster) is hostile to the classical power of equilibrium:
supposing one possessed this loftiness and was nonetheless classi­
cal, then we could confidently infer that one also possessed im­
morality of the same level: possibly the case of Shakespeare
(assuming it was really Lord Bacon).157

esprit, hatred for the manifold, uncertain, rambling, for intimations,
as well as for the brief, pointed, pretty, good-natured. One should
not play with artistic formulas: one should remodel life so that
afterward it has to formulate itself.
It is an amusing comedy at which we have only now learned
to laugh, which we only now see: that the contemporaries of
Herder, Winckelmann, Goethe, and Hegel claimed to have redis­
covered the classical ideal— and at the same time Shakespeare!—
And the same generation had meanly repudiated the French classi­

To think through, without prejudice or indulgence, in what
soil a classical taste can grow. Hardening, simplification, strength­
ening, making man more evil: these belong together. Logicalpsychological simplification. Contempt for detail, complexity, the
uncertain.
The romantics in Germany do not protest against classicism,
but against reason, enlightenment, taste, the eighteenth century.
The sensibility of roman tic-Wagnerian music: antithesis of
classical sensibility.
The will to unity (because unity tyrannizes— namely over
the listener, spectator); but inability to tyrannize over oneself
concerning the main thing— namely in regard to the work itself
(omitting, shortening, clarifying, simplifying). Overwhelming
through masses (Wagner, Victor Hugo, Zola, Taine).

The nihilism of artists,— Nature cruel in her cheerfulness;
cynical in her sunrises. We are enemies of sentimental emotions.
We flee to where nature moves our senses and our imagination;
where we have nothing to love, where we are not reminded of the
moral semblances and delicacies of this northerly nature— and the
same is the case in the arts. We prefer that which no longer re­
minds us of “good and evil.” Our moralistic susceptibility to
stimuli and pain is, as it were, redeemed by a terrible and happy
nature, in the fatalism of the senses and forces. Life without good­
ness.
The benefit consists in the contemplation of nature’s magnifi­
cent indifference to good and evil.
No justice in history, no goodness in nature: that is why the
pessimist, if he is an artist, goes in historicis1™ to those places
where the absence of justice itself is revealed with splendid naivete,
where perfection comes into view— and also in nature, to those
places where her evil and indifferent character is not disguised,
where she exhibits the character of perfection— The nihilistic
artist betrays himself in willing and preferring cynical history,
cynical nature.
In historical matters*
Nietzsche’s repeated emphasis on the magnificent indifference of nature
invites comparison with the conclusion of Camus’ The Stranger; indeed this
whole section—and not only this section—may have left its mark on Camus.
Note also Nietzsche’s frequent use of the word “absurd.”

851 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
What is tragic?— On repeated occasions I have laid my
finger on Aristotle’s great misunderstanding in believing the tragic
affects to be two depressive affects, terror and pity. If he were
right, tragedy would be an art dangerous to life: one would have
to warn against it as notorious and a public danger. Art, in other
cases the great stimulant of life, an intoxication with life, a will to
life, would here, in the service of a declining movement and as it
were the handmaid of pessimism, become harmful to health
(— for that one is “purged” of these affects through their arousal,
as Aristotle seems to believe, is simply not true). Something that
habitually arouses terror or pity disorganizes, weakens, discour­
ages— and supposing Schopenhauer were right that one should
learn resignation from tragedy (i.e., a gentle renunciation of
happiness, hope, will to life), then this would be an art in which
art denies itself. Tragedy Would then signify a process of disinte­
gration: the instinct for life destroying itself through the instinct
for art. Christianity, nihilism, tragic art, physiological decadence—
these would go hand in hand, come into predominance at the
same time, assist one another forward—downward— Tragedy
would be a symptom of decline.
One can refute this theory in the most cold-blooded way:
namely, by measuring the effects of a tragic emotion with a
dynamometer. And one would discover as a result what ultimately
only the absolute mendaciousness of a systematizer could mis­
understand—that tragedy is a tonic. If Schopenhauer did not want
to grasp this, if he posited a general depression as the tragic con­
dition, if he suggested to the Greeks (— who to his annoyance did
not “resign themselves”— ) that they had not attained the highest
view of the world— that is parti pris, logic of a system, counter­
feit of a systematizer: one of those dreadful counterfeits that ruined
Schopenhauer’s whole psychology, step by step (— arbitrarily and
violently, he misunderstood genius, art itself, morality, pagan reli­
gion, beauty, knowledge, and more or less everything).

individual or of a people), whether and where the judgment “beau­
tiful” is applied. The feeling of plenitude, of dammed-up strength
(which permits one to meet with courage and good-humor much
that makes the weakling shudder)— the feeling of power applies
the judgment “beautiful” even to things and conditions that the
instinct of impotence could only find hateful and “ugly.” The nose
for what we could still barely deal with if it confronted us in the
flesh— as danger, problem, temptation— this determines even our
aesthetic Yes. ( “That is beautiful” is an affirmation.)
From this it appears that, broadly speaking, a preference for
questionable and terrifying things is a symptom of strength; while
a taste for the pretty and dainty belongs to the weak and delicate.
Pleasure in tragedy characterizes strong ages and natures: their
non plus ultra is perhaps the divina commedia. It is the heroic
spirits who say Yes to themselves in tragic cruelty: they are hard
enough to experience suffering as a pleasure.
Supposing, on the other hand, that the weak desire to enjoy
an art that is not meant for them; what Would they do to make
tragedy palatable for themselves? They would interpret their own
value feelings into it; e.g., the “triumph of the moral world-order”
or the doctrine of the “worthlessness of existence” or the invitation
to “resignation” (— or half-medicinal, half-moral discharges of
affects a la Aristotle).1®0 Finally: the art of the terrifying, in so
far as it excites the nerves, can be esteemed by the weak and
exhausted as a stimulus: that, for example, is the reason Wag­
nerian art is esteemed today. It is a sign of one’s feeling of power
and well-being how far one can acknowledge the terrifying and
questionable character of things; and whether one needs some
sort of “solution” at the end.
This type of artists' pessimism is precisely the opposite of that
religio-moral pessimism that suffers from the “corruption” of man
and the riddle of existence— and by all means craves a solution, or
at least a hope for a solution. The suffering, desperate, self­
mistrustful, in a word the sick, have at all times had need of
entrancing visions to endure life ( this is the origin of the concept
“blessedness” ). A related case: the artists of decadence, who
fundamentally have a nihilistic attitude toward life, take refuge
in the beauty of form— in those select things in which nature has
become perfect, in which she is indifferently great and beautiful—

also criticized in section 851.

(— “Love of beauty” can therefore be something other than the
ability to see the beautiful, create the beautiful; it can be an expres­
sion of the very inability to do so.)
Those imposing artists who let a harmony sound forth front
every conflict are those who bestow upon things their own power
and self-redemption: they express their innermost experience in
the symbolism of every work of art they produce— their creativity
is gratitude for their existence.
The profundity of the tragic artist lies in this, that his aesthetic
instinct surveys the more remote consequences, that he does not
halt shortsightedly at what is closest at hand, that he affirms the
large-scale economy which justifies the terrifying, the evil, the
questionable— and more than merely justifies them.

(i)
The conception of the work that one encounters in the back­
ground of this book is singularly gloomy and unpleasant: no type
of pessimism known hitherto seems to have attained to this degree
of malevolence. The antithesis of a real and an apparent world is
lacking here: there is only one world, and this is false, cruel,
contradictory, seductive, without meaning— A world thus con­
stituted is the real world. We have need of lies in order to conquer
this reality, this “truth,” that is, in order to live— That lies are
necessary in order to live is itself part of the terrifying and ques­
tionable character of existence.
Metaphysics, morality, religion, science— in this book these
things merit consideration only as various forms of lies: with their
help one can have faith in life. “Life ought to inspire confidence” :
the task thus imposed is tremendous. To solve it, man must be a
liar by nature, he must be above all an artist. And he is one:
metaphysics, religion, morality, science— all of them only products

fragmentary draft for a preface for the new edition of The Birth of Tragedy,

itself solely on the notebook in which these pages were filed. The internal
evidence for a date earlier than the preface actually published in 1886 seems
very strong, as that preface is vastly superior in form and content to the

piece of reality, truth, nature: how should he not also be a piece
of genius in lying!
That the character of existence is to be misunderstood—profoundest and supreme secret motive behind all that is virtue, science,
piety, artistry. Never to see many things, to see many things falsely,
to imagine many things: oh how shrewd one still is in circum­
stances in which one is furthest from thinking oneself shrewd!
Love, enthusiasm, “God”— So many subtleties of ultimate selfdeception, so many seductions to life, so much faith in life! In
those moments in which man was deceived, in which he duped
himself, in which he believes in life: oh how enraptured he feels!
What delight! What a feeling of power! How much artists’ triumph
in the feeling of power!— Man has once again become master of
“material”—master of truth!— And whenever man rejoices, he is
always the same in his rejoicing: he rejoices as an artist, he enjoys
himself as power, he enjoys the lie as his form of power.—

clearly, nihilism, counts as “truth.” But truth does not count as
the supreme value, even less as the supreme power. The will to
appearance, to illusion, to deception, to becoming and change
(to objectified deception) here counts as more profound, primeval,
“metaphysical” than the will to truth, to reality, to mere appear­
ance:— the last is itself merely a form of the will to illusion. In
the same way, pleasure counts as being more primeval than pain:
pain only as conditioned, as a consequence of the will to pleasure
(of the will to become, grow, shape, i.e., to create: in creation,
however, destruction is included). A highest state of affirmation
of existence is conceived from which the highest degree of pain
cannot be excluded: the tragic-Dionysian state.
(IV)
In this way, this book is even anti-pessimistic: that is, in the
sense that it teaches something that is stronger than pessimism,
“more divine” than truth: art. Nobody, it seems, would more seri­
ously propose a radical negation of life, a really active negation
even more than merely saying No to life, than the author of this
book. Except that he knows— he has experience of it, perhaps he
has experience of nothing else!— that art is worth more than truth.

tions 398, 462, 862, 1053; Beyond, sections 225 and 262; and the last three
pages of Chapter 10 of my Nietzsche.
Very few of Nietzsche’s notes deal with “breeding,” and the contents
of Book IV therefore bear little relation to this title. The same considera­
tion appiies to the second part of Book IV: “Dionysus.”
Nietzsche’s sister might have chosen a later draft instead of this one,
of March 17, 1887, which put down Zucht und Ziichtung as the title of
Book IV (this draft consists only of the four book titles, and does not
include any subdivisions). But most of the other drafts, being more de­
tailed, would have posed even greater problems.

I. ORDER OF RANK

1. The Doctrine of Order of Rank
854 (1884)
In the age of suffrage universel, i.e., when everyone may sit
in judgment on everyone and everything, I feel impelled to re­
establish order of rank.

855 (Spring-Fall 1887)
What determines rank, sets off rank, is only quanta of power,
and nothing else.

856 (1885-1886)
The will to power.— How those men would have to be con­
stituted who took upon themselves this revaluation. Order of rank
as order of power: war and danger the presupposition for a rank
to retain the conditions of its existence. The grandiose prototype:
man in nature— the weakest, shrewdest creature making himself
master, subjugating the stupider forces.

857 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
I distinguish between a type Of ascending life and another
type of decay, disintegration, weakness. Is it credible that the
question of the relative rank of these two types still needs to be
posed?

858 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
What determines your rank is the quantum of power you are:
the rest is cowardice.

Advantage of detachment from one’s age.— In a state of de­
tachment from both movements, individualistic and collectivistic
morality—for even the former does not recognize order of rank
and would grant one the same freedom as all. My ideas do not re­
volve around the degree of freedom that is granted to the one or to
the other or to all, but around the degree of power that the one
or the Other should exercise Over others or Over all, and to what
extent a sacrifice of freedom, even enslavement, provides the basis
for the emergence of a higher type. Put in the crudest form: how
could one sacrifice the development of mankind to help a higher
species than man to come into existence?—

860 (1884)
Of rank. The terrible consequence of “equality”— finally,
everyone believes he has a right to every problem. All order of
rank has vanished.

861 (1884)
A declaration of war oh the masses by higher men is needed!
Everywhere the mediocre are combining in order to make them­
selves master! Everything that makes soft and effeminate, that
serves the ends of the “people” or the “feminine,” works in favor
of suffrage universel, i.e., the dominion Of inferior men. But we
should take reprisal and bring this whole affair (which in Europe
commenced with Christianity) to light and to the bar of judgment.

862 (1884)
A doctrine is needed powerful enough to work as a breeding
agent: strengthening the strong, paralyzing and destructive for the
world-weary.1

The annihilation of the decaying races. Decay of Europe.—
The annihilation of slavish evaluations.— Dominion over the earth
as a means of producing a higher type.— The annihilation of the
tartuffery called “morality” (Christianity as a hysterical kind of
honesty in this: Augustine, Bunyan).— The annihilation of suf­
frage universel; i.e., the system through which the lowest natures
prescribe themselves as laws for the higher.— The annihilation of
mediocrity and its acceptance. (The onesided, individuals^peoples; to strive for fullness of nature through the pairing of
opposites: race mixture to this end).— The new courage— no
a priori truths (such truths were sought by those accustomed
to faith!), but a free subordination to a ruling idea that has its
time: e.g., time as a property of space, etc.

2. The Strong and the Weak

863 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
The concept “stronger and weaker man” reduces itself to the
idea that in the first case a great deal of force is inherited—he is
a summation— in the second, as yet little— (— inadequate in­
heritance, splintering of that which is inherited). Weakness can be
an inaugural phenomenon: “as yet little”; or a terminal phe­
nomenon: “no more.”
The starting point is where great force is, where force is to
be discharged. The mass, as the sum of the weak, reacts slowly;
defends itself against much for which it is too weak— of which it
can make no use; does not create, does not advance.
This in opposition to the theory that denies the strong indi­
vidual and believes “the mass does it.” It is the same difference as
between two separated generations: four or five generations may
lie between the active agent and the mass— a chronological differ­
ence.
The values of the weak prevail because the strong have taken
them over as devices of leadership.

460

THE WILL

TO P O W E R

864 (March-June 1888)
W ky the weak conquer. In summa: the sick and weak have
more sympathy, are “more humane”— : the sick and weak have
more spirit, are more changeable, various, entertaining—more ma­
licious: it was the sick who invented malice. (A morbid precocious­
ness is often found in the rickety, scrofulous and tubercular— .)
Esprit: quality of late races: Jews, Frenchmen, Chinese. (The antiSemites do not forgive the Jews for possessing “spirit”— and money.
Anti-Semites—another name for the! ‘‘underprivileged.”)
The sick and weak have had fascination on their side: they
are more interesting than the healthy: the fool and the saint— the
two most interesting kinds of man— closely related to them, the
“genius.” The great “adventurers and criminals” and all men, es­
pecially the most healthy, are sick at certain periods in their lives:
— the great emotions, the passions of power, love, revenge, are
accompanied by profound disturbances. And as for decadence, it
is represented in alihost every sense by every man who does not
die too soon:— thus he also knows from experience the instincts
that belong to it:— almost every man is decadent for half his
life.
Finally: woman! One-half of mankind is weak, typically sick,
changeable, inconstant— woman needs strength in order to cleave
to it; she needs a religion of weakness that glorifies being weak,
loving, and being humble as divine: or better, she makes the strong
weak—she rules when she succeeds in overcoming the strong.
Woman has always conspired with the types of decadence, the
priests, against the “powerful,” the “strong,” the men— . Woman
brings the children to the cult of piety, pity, love:— the mother
represents altruism convincingly.
Finally: increasing civilization, which necessarily brings with
it an increase in the morbid elements, in the neurotic-psychiatric
and criminal. An intermediary species arises: the artist, restrained
from crime by weakness of will and social timidity, and not yet ripe
for the madhouse, but reaching out inquisitively toward both
spheres with his antennae: this specific culture plant, the modern
artist, painter, musician, above all novelist, who describes his mode
of life with the very inappropriate word “naturalism”— Lunatics,
criminals, and “naturalists” are increasing: sign of a growing cul-

book f o u r :

461

ture rushing on precipitately— i.e., the refuse, the waste, gain im­
portance— the decline keeps pace.
Finally: the social hodgepodge, consequence of the Revolution,
the establishment of equal rights, of the superstition of “equal
men.” The bearers of the instincts of decline (of ressentiment, dis­
content, the drive to destroy, anarchism, and nihilism), including
the slave instincts, the instincts of cowardice, cunning, and canaille
in those orders that have long been kept down, mingle with the
blood of all classes: two, three generations later the race is no
longer recognizable—everything has become mob. From this there
results a collective instinct against selection, against privilege of
all kinds, that is so powerful and self-assured, hard, and cruel in
its operation, that the privileged themselves actually soon succumb
to it: whoever still wants to retain power flatters the mob, works
With the mob, must have the mob on its side—the “geniuses” above
all: they become heralds of those feelings with which one moves the
masses— the note of sympathy, even reverence, for all that has
lived a life of suffering, lowliness, contempt, persecution, sounds
above all other notes (types: Victor Hugo and Richard Wag­
ner).— The rise of the mob signifies once again the ascendancy of
the old values.
Such an extreme movement in respect of tempo and means as
our civilization represents, shifts men’s center of gravity: those men
who matter most, who have, as it were, the task of compensating
for the vast danger of such a morbid movement;— they will become
procrastinators par excellence, slow to adopt, reluctant to let go,
and relatively enduring in the midst of this tremendous change and
mixture of elements. In such circumstances, the center of gravity
necessarily shifts to the mediocre: against the dominion of the
mob and of the eccentric (both are usually united), mediocrity
consolidates itself as the guarantee and bearer of the future. Thus
emerges a new opponent for exceptional men— or a new seduction.
Provided they do not accommodate themselves to the mob and try
to flatter the instincts Of the “disinherited,” they will have to be
“mediocre” and “solid.” They know: mediocritas is also aurea2—
indeed, it alone disposes of money and gold (— of all that glitters—)
— And once more the old virtue, and the entire dated World of the
ideal in general, gains a body of gifted advocates.— Result:
9 Mediocrity is also gold.

mediocrity acquires spirit, wit, genius— it becomes entertaining, it

Result.— A high culture can stand only upon a broad base,
upon a strong and healthy consolidated mediocrity. Scicnce— and
even art— work in its service and are served by it. Science could
not wish for a better situation: it belongs as such to a mediocre
kind of man—it is out of place among the exceptional— it has
nothing aristocratic, and even less anything anarchistic, in its
instinct.
The power of the middle is, further, upheld by trade, above all
trade in money: the instinct of great financiers goes against every­
thing extreme— that is why the Jews are at present the most con­
serving power in our intensely threatened and insecure Europe.
They can have no use for revolution, socialism* or militarism: if
they desire and employ power, even over the revolutionary party,
this is only a consequence of the aforesaid and not a contradiction.
They need occasionally to arouse fear of other extreme tendencies—
by demonstrating how much power they have in their hands. But
their instinct itself is unswervingly conservative— and “mediocre”—
Wherever there is power, they know how to be powerful; but the
employment of their power is always in one direction. The honor­
able term for mediocre is, of course, the word "liberal.”
y+
Reflection.—- It is absurd to assume that this whole victory
of values is antibiological: one must try to explain it in terms of
an interest life has in preserving the; type “man” even through this
method of the dominance of the weak and underprivileged— :
otherwise, man would cease to exist?— Problem—------ The enhancement of the type fatal for the preservation of the
species? Why?
History shows: the strong races decimate one another: through
war, thirst for power, adventurousness; the strong affects: wasteful­
ness— (strength is no longer hoarded, spiritual disturbance arises
through excessive tension); their existence is costly; in brief—they
’ In the MS the following words are written in the margin before the
next paragraph: "The crafts, trade, agriculture, science, a large part of the
arts—all this can rest only bn a broad base, on a strongly and healthily con­
solidated mediocrity.” These notes were used in The Antichrist, section 57
(Portable Nietzsche, p. 646).

ruin one another; periods of profound exhaustion and torpor
supervene: all great ages are paid for— The strong are subsequently
weaker, more devoid of will, more absurd than the weak average.
They are races that squander. “Duration” as such has no
value: one might well prefer a shorter but more valuable existence
for the species.— It would remain to be proved that, even so, a
richer yield of value would be gained than in the case of the shorter
existence; i.e.; that man as summation of strength acquires a much
greater quantum of mastery over things if life is as it is— We
stand before a problem of economics—*----865 (Spring-Fall 1887)
An attitude that calls itself “idealism” and that will not allow
mediocrity to be mediocre, or woman to be woman!— No uni­
formity! Let us be clear how dearly a virtue is bought; and that
virtue is not something of average desirability, but a noble mad­
ness, a beautiful exception, with the privilege of strong feelings—
866 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
The need to show that as the consumption of man and man­
kind becomes more and more economical and the “machinery” of
interests and services is integrated ever more intricately, a counter­
movement is inevitable. I designate this as the secretion of a luxuiy
surplus of mankind: it aims to bring to light a stronger species, a
higher type that arises and preserves itself under different condi­
tions from those of the average man. My concept, my metaphor for
this type is, as one knows, the word “overman.”
On that first road which can now be completely surveyed,
arise adaptation, leveling, higher Chinadom, modesty in the instincts,
satisfaction in the dwarfing of mankind— a kind of stationary level
of mankind. Once we possess that common economic management
of the earth that will soon be inevitable, mankind will be able to
find its best meaning as a machine in the service of this economy—
as a tremendous clockwork, composed of ever smaller, ever more
subtly “adapted” gears; as an ever-growing superfluity of all
dominating and commanding elements; as a whole of tremendous
force, whose individual factors represent minimal forces, minimal
values.
In opposition to this dwarfing and adaptation of man to a

464

THE

WILL

TO P O W E R

specialized utility, a reverse movement is needed—the production
of a synthetic, summarizing, justifying man for whose existence
this transformation of mankind into a machine is a precondition, as
a base on which he can invent his higher form of being.
He needs the opposition of the masses, of the “leveled,” a
feeling of distance from them! he stands on them, he lives off them.
This higher form of aristocracy is that of the future.-*- Morally
speaking, this overall machinery* this solidarity of all gears, repre­
sents a maximum in the exploitation of man; but it presupposes
those on whose account this exploitation has meaning. Otherwise
it would really be nothing but an overall diminution, a value di­
minution of the type man—a regressive phenomenon in the grand
style.
It is clear, what I combat is economic optimism: as if increas­
ing expenditure of everybody must necessarily involve the in­
creasing welfare of everybody. The opposite seems to me to be
the case: expenditure of everybody amounts to a collective loss:
man is diminished— so one no longer knows what aim this tre­
mendous process has served. An aim? a new aim?— that is what
humanity needs.
867 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Insight into the increase of overall power: to calculate to
what extent even the decline of individuals, of classes, of ages, of
peoples is included in this growth.
Shifting of the center of gravity of a culture. The cost of
every great growth: who bears it! Why it must now be tremendous.
868 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
Overall view of the future European: the most intelligent
slave animals, very indutsrious, fundamentally very modest, in­
quisitive to excess, multifarious, pampered, weak of will— a cosmo­
politan chaos of affects and intelligence. How could a stronger
species raise itself out of him? A species with classical taste?
Classical taste: this means will to simplification, strengthening, to
visible happiness, to the terrible, the courage of psychological
nakedness (— simplification is a consequence of the will to strength­
ening; allowing happiness to become visible, also nakedness, a

book f o u r :

465

consequence of the will to be terrible— ). To fight upward out of
that chaos to this form— requires a compulsion: one must be faced
with the choice of perishing or prevailing. A dominating race can
grow up only out of terrible and violent beginnings. Problem:
where are the barbarians of the twentieth century? Obviously,
they will come into view and consolidate themselves only after
tremendous socialist crises— they will be the elements capable
o f the greatest severity toward themselves and able to gurantee
the most enduring will.
869 (1885-1886)
The most powerful and most dangerous passions of man, of
which he can most easily perish, have been outlawed so com­
pletely that the most powerful men themselves have become im­
possible or have had to feel evil—-“harmful and forbidden.” This
loss is considerable, but hitherto it has been unavoidable: now
that a host of counterforces has been reared by the temporary
suppression of those passions (of lust for power, pleasure in change
and deception), it is again possible to unloose them: they will
no longer possess their old savagery. We permit ourselves a
tame barbarism: just look at our artists and statesmen.
870 (1884)
The root of all evil: that the slavish morality of meekness,
chastity, selflessness, absolute obedience* has triumphed— ruling
natures were thus condemned (1) to hypocrisy, (1) to torments
of conscience— creative natures felt like rebels against God, un­
certain and inhibited by eternal values.
The barbarians showed that the ability for restraint was
not at home among them: they feared and slandered the passions
and drives of nature:— also the view of the ruling Caesars and
classes* On the other hand, the suspicion arose that all moderation
was weakness, or a sign of growing old and weary (— thus La
Rochefoucauld suspected that “virtue” was a pretty word among
those who could no longer take any pleasure in vice). Moderation
itself was represented as a matter of severity, self-conquest, asceti­
cism, as a fight with the devil, etc. The natural delight of aesthetic
natures in measure, the enjoyment of the beauty of measure, was

466

THE

WILL

TO P O W E R

overlooked or denied, because one desired an anti-eudaemonistic
morality.
The faith in the pleasure of moderation— that pleasure of
the rider on a fiery steed!— has been lacking hitherto.— The
mediocrity of weaker natures has been confused with the modera­
tion of the strong!
In summa: the best things have been slandered because the
weak or the immoderate swine have cast a bad light on them—
and the best men have remained hidden— and have often mis­
understood themselves.
871 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
The vicious and unbridled: their depressive influence on the
value of the desires. It was the dreadful barbarism of custom that,
especially in the Middle Ages, compelled the creation of a veritable
“league of virtue”— together with an equally dreadful exaggeration
of that which constitutes the value of man. Struggling “civilization”
(taming) needs every kind of irons and torture to maintain itself
against terribleness and beast-of-prey natures.
Here a confusion is quite natural, although its influence has
been fatal: that which men of power and will are able to demand
of themselves also provides a measure of that which they may
permit themselves. Such natures are the antithesis of the vicious
and unbridled: although they may on occasion do things that
would convict a lesser man of vice and immoderation.
Here the concept of the “equal value of men before God” is
extraordinarily harmful; one forbade actions and attitudes that
were in themselves among the prerogatives of the strongly con­
stituted— as if they were in themselves unworthy of men. One
brought the entire tendency of the strong into disrepute when one
erected the protective measures of the weakest (those who were
weakest also when confronting themselves) as a norm of value.
Confusion went so far that one branded the very virtuosi of
life (whose autonomy offered the sharpest antithesis to the vicious
and unbridled) with the most opprobrious names. Even now one
believes one must disapprove of a Cesare Borgia; that is simply
laughable. The church has excommunicated German emperors on
account of their vices: as if a monk or priest had any right to
join in a discussion about what a Frederick II may demand of him­

self. A Don Juan is sent to hell: that is very naive. Has it been
noticed that in heaven all interesting men are missing?— Just a
hint to the girls as to where they can best find their salvation.—
If one reflects with some consistency, and moreover with a deepened
insight into what a “great man” is, no doubt remains that the
church sends all “great men” to hell— it fights against all “great­
ness of man.”
872 (1884)
The rights a man arrogates to himself are related to the
duties he imposes upon himself, to the tasks to which he feels
equal. The great majority of men have no right to existence, but
are a misfortune to higher men.4
873 (1884)
Misunderstanding of egoism— on the part of common natures
who know nothing whatever of the pleasure of conquest and the
insatiability of great love, nor of the overflowing feeling of strength
that desires to overpower, to compel to itself, to lay to its heart—
the drive of the artist in relation to his material. Often it is merely
the penchant for activity that is looking for a field of action.
In ordinary “egoism” it is precisely the “non-ego,” the
profoundly average creature, the species man, who desires to
preserve himself: if this is perceived by rarer, subtler, and less
average men, it enrages them. For they judge: “we are nobler!
Our preservation is more important than that of those cattle!”
874 (1884)
The degeneration of the rulers and the ruling classes has
been the cause of the greastest mischief in history! Without the
Roman Caesars and Roman society, the insanity of Christianity
would never have come to power.

of the Jews, the Poles, the Russians, or any other peoples whom the Nazis
later decimated.

When lesser men begin to doubt whether higher men exist,
then the danger is great! And one ends by discovering that there
is virtue also among the lowly and subjugated, the poor in spirit,
and that before God men are equal—which has so far been the
non plus ultra of nonsense on earth! For ultimately, the higher men
measured themselves according to the standard of virtue of slaves
—found they were “proud,” etc., found all their higher qualities
reprehensible.
When Nero and Caracalla sat up there, the paradox arose:
“the lowest man is worth more than that man up there!” And the
way was prepared for an image of God that was as remote as
possible from the image of the most powerful— the god on the
cross!
875 (18,84)
The higher man and the herd man. When great men are
lacking, one makes demigods or whole gods out of the great
men of the past: the outbreak of religion demonstrates that m an
no longer delights man (— “no, nor woman neither,” with Ham let).
Or: one brings many men together into one heap as a parliament
and hopes they will be equally tyrannical.
“Tyrannization” is the quality of great men: they make lesser
men stupid.
876 (1888)
The best example of the degree to Which a plebeian agitator
of the mob is incapable of comprehending the concept “higher
nature” is provided by Buckle. The view he combats so passion­
ately— that “great men,” individuals, princes, statesmen, geniuses,
generals are the levers and causes of all great movements— is in­
stinctively misunderstood by him, as if it meant that what is
essential and valuable in such “higher men” were their capacity
for setting masses in motion: in short, their effect.
But the “higher nature” of the great man lies in being dif­
ferent, in incommunicability, in distance of rank, not in an effect
of any kind— even if he made the whole globe tremble.®
'T h e misunderstanding attacked here is widespread among those who
have attempted popular expositions of Nietzsche. Again and again, the view

The Revolution made Napoleon possible: that is its justification. For the sake of a similar prize one would have to desire
the anarchical collapse of our entire civilization. Napoleon made
nationalism possible: that is its excuse.9
The value of a man (apart from his morality or immorality,
naturally; for with these concepts the value of a man is not even
touched) does not reside in his utility; for it would continue to
exist even if there were no one to whom he could be of any use.
And why could not precisely that man who produced the most
disastrous effects be the pinnacle of the whole species of man:
so high, so superior that everything would perish from envy of
him?
878 (Spring-Fall 1887)
To appraise the value of a man according to how useful he
is to men, or how much he costs, or what harm he does them—
that is as much—or as little— as to appraise a work of art accord­
ing to the effects it produces. But in this way* the value of a man
in comparison with other men is not even touched upon. “Moral
evaluation,” in so far as it is a social evaluation, measures men
exclusively according to the effects they produce. A man with a
taste of his own, enclosed and concealed by his solitude, incom­
municable, reserved-—an unfathomed man, thus a man of a higher,
at any rate a different species: how should you be able to evaluate
him, since you cannot know him, cannot compare him?
Moral valuation has resulted in the greatest obtuseness of
judgment: the value of a man in himself is underrated, almost over­
looked, almost denied. Remnant of naive teleology: the value of
man only in relation to men.
he castigates has been attributed to him. In this connection, the sections
that immediately follow are also of great interest; especially 877-81 and
885-88, as well as 983-84.

Preoccupation with morality places a spirit in a low order of
rank: he lacks the instinct for privilege, the a parte, the feeling of
freedom of creative natures, of the "children of God” (or of the
devil— ). And it is all one whether he preaches current morality
or uses his ideal for a critique of current morality: he belongs to
the herd— even if it be as the herd’s supreme requirement, its
“shepherd.”
880 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Replacement of morality by the will to our goal, and conse­
quently to the means to it.
881 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
Order of rank:— What is mediocre in the typical man? That
he does not understand the necessity for the reverse side of things:
that he combats evils as if one could dispense with them; that he
will not take the one with the other— that he wants to erase and
extinguish the typical character of a thing, a condition, an age,
a person, approving of only one part of their qualities and wishing
to abolish the others. The “desirability” of the mediocre is what we
others combat: the ideal conceived as something in which nothing
harmful, evil, dangerous, questionable, destructive would remain.
Our insight is the opposite of this: that with every growth of man,
his other side must grow too; that the highest man, if such a
concept be allowed, would be the man who represented the anti­
thetical character of existence most strongly, as its glory and sole
justification— Commonplace men can represent only a tiny nook
and corner of this natural character: they perish when the multi­
plicity of elements and the tension of opposites, i.e., the pre­
conditions for greatness in man, increases. That man must grow
better and more evil is my formula for this inevitability—
Most men represent pieces and fragments of mari: one has
to add them up for a complete man to appear. Whole ages, whole
peoples are in this sense somewhat fragmentary; it is perhaps
part of the economy of human evolution that man should evolve
piece by piece. But that should not make one forget for a moment

that the real issue is the production of the synthetic man; that
lower men, the tremendous majority, are merely preludes and re­
hearsals out of whose medley the whole man appears here and
there, the milestone man who indicates how far humanity has
advanced so far. It does not advance in a single straight line;
often a type once achieved is lost again (■—with all the tensions
of the past three hundred years, for example* we have not yet
reattained the man of the Renaissance, and the man of the Renais­
sance, in turn, is inferior to the man of antiquity).7
882 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
One recognizes the superiority of the Greek man and the
Renaissance man—but one would like to have them without the
causes and conditions that made them possible.
883 (Spring-Fall 1887)
“Purification of taste” can only be the result of a strengthen­
ing of the type. Our society of today only represents culture; the

THE

WILL

TO POWER

by employing one against the other and reserving freedom for
itself.
885 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
I have grasped this much: if one had made the rise of great
and rare men dependent upon the approval of the many (assum­
ing that the latter knew what qualities belonged to greatness and
also at whose expense all greatness evolves)— well, there would
never have been a single significant man!—
That the course of things makes its way independently of
the approval of the great majority: that is why a few astonishing
things have insinuated themselves on the earth.
886 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The order of rank of human values.—
a. One should not evaluate a man according to individual
works. Epidermal actions. Nothing is rarer than a personal action.
A class, a rank, a race, an environment, an accident— anything
is more likely to be expressed in a work or act than is a “per­
sonality’’ ;[eine "Person" ].
b. One should not assume in any case that many men are
“personalities.” And then some are several personalities, most
are none. Wherever the average qualities preponderate, on which
the preservation of a type depends, being a personality would be
a waste, a luxury, it would be senseless to demand a “personality.”
They are bearers, tools of transmission.
c. The "personality,” a relatively isolated fact; considering
the far greater importance of continuation and averageness, almost
something antinatural. For the production of a personality one
needs early isolation, a compulsion to an existence of defense
and combat, something like an incarceration, a greater power of
self-definition; and above all a much lower impressionability than
that of the average man, whose humanity is contagious.
First question concerning order of rank: how solitary or how
gregarious one is. (In the latter case, one’s value resides in the
qualities that secure the survival of one’s herd, one’s type; in the
former, in that which distinguishes, isolates, defends one, and
makes one’s solitariness possible.)
Consequence: one should not evaluate the solitary type from

book fo u r

: Discipline and Breeding

473

the viewpoint of the gregarious, nor the gregarious from the view­
point of the solitary.
Viewed from a height, both are necessary; their antagonism
is also necessary— and nothing should be banished more thoroughly
than the “desirability” that some third thing might evolve out of
the two (“virtue” as hermaphroditism). That is as little “desirable”
as the approximation and reconciliation of the sexes. To evolve
further that which is typical, to make the gulf wider and wider-----Concept of degeneration in both cases: when the herd starts
to acquire the qualities of the solitary, and the latter the qualities
of the herd—in short, when they approximate each other. This
concept of degeneration has nothing to do with moral evaluation.
887 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Where one must seek the stronger natures.— The ruin and
degeneration of the solitary species is much greater and more ter­
rible; they have the instincts of the herd, the tradition of values,
against them; their instruments of defense, their protective in­
stincts, are from the beginning not sufficiently strong or certain
— chance must be very favorable to them if they are to prosper
(— they prosper most often in the lowest and socially most aban­
doned elements; if one looks for personality, that is where one
finds it much more certainly than in the middle classes!).
The strata and class struggle that aims at “equality of rights”
— once it is more or less over, the war against the solitary per­
sonality will begin. (In a certain sense, the latter can maintain and
develop himself most easily in a democratic society: namely, when
the coarser means of defense are no longer necessary and habits
of order, honesty, justice, and trust are part of the usual con­
ditions.)
The strongest must be bound most firmly, watched, laid in
chains, and guarded—if the instinct of the herd has its way. For
them a regime of self-control, ascetic detachment, or “duty” in
exhausting work in which one completely loses oneself.
888 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
I attempt an economic justification of virtue.— The task is
to make man as useful as possible and to approximate him, as
far as possible, to an infallible machine: to this end he must be

474

THE

WILL

TO P O W E R

equipped with the virtues of the machine (— he must learn to
experience the states in which he works in a mechanically useful
way as the supremely valuable states; hence it is necessary to
spoil the other states for him as much as possible, as highly danger­
ous and disreputable).
The first stumbling block is the boredom, the monotony, that
all mechanical activity brings with it. To learn to endure this—
and not only endure it— to learn to see boredom enveloped in a
higher charm: this has hitherto been the task of all higher school­
ing. To learn something that is of no concern to us, and to find
one’s “duty” precisely in this “objective” activity; to learn to value
pleasure and duty as altogether separate things— that is the in­
valuable task and achievement of higher schooling. This is why
the philologist has hitherto been the educator as such: because his
activity provides the model of sublime monotony in action; under
his banner the young man learns to “grind” : first prerequisite for
future efficiency in the fulfillment of mechanical duties (as civil
servant, husband, office slave, newspaper reader, and soldier).
Such an existence perhaps requires a philosophical justification and
transfiguration more than any other: agreeable feelings in general
must be relegated to a lower rank by some sort of infallible court
of appeal; “duty in itself,” perhaps even the pathos of reverence in
regard to everything disagreeable— and this demand speaking
imperatively from beyond any question of utility, amusement,
purpose— The mechanical form of existence as the highest, most
venerable form of existence, worshiping itself (— type: Kant as
a fanatic of the formal concept “thou shalt” ) .8
889 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
The economic valuation of ideals hitherto— i.e., selection of
certain affects and states, selected and reared at the expense of
others. The lawgiver (or the instinct of society) selects a number
of states and affects through whose operation a regularity in
performance is guaranteed (namely, a mechanical performance
as a consequence of the regular requirements of those affects and
states).
Supposing that these states and affects contain painful in­
9Cf. Twilight, “Skirmishes,” section 29 (Portable Nietzsche, p. 532),
where these ideas receive the definitive formulation.

book f o u r :

Discipline and Breeding

475

gradients, then a means must be found to overcome these painful
ingredients through a value-idea designed to make displeasure
seem valuable and therefore pleasurable in a higher sense. Re­
duced to a formula: "How can something disagreeable become
agreeable?" For example, when our obedience, our submission
to the law, attain honor through the strength, power, self-over­
coming they entail.0 As do our consideration for the community,
the neighbor, the fatherland, our “humanization,” our “altruism,”
“heroism,”
That one should like to do disagreeable things— that is the
object of ideals.
890 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The dwarfing of man must for a long time count as the
only goal; because a broad foundation has first to be created so
that a stronger species of man can stand upon it. (To what extent
every strengthened species of man hitherto has stood upon a level
of the lower--------- )
891 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Absurd and contemptible form of idealism that would not
have mediocrity mediocre and, instead of feeling a sense of triumph
at a state of exceptionalness, becomes indignant over cowardice,
falsity, pettiness, and wretchedness. One should not desire these
things to be different and should make the gulf wider*— One
should compel the higher kind of man to sever himself from the
others through the sacrifices he has to make to his state of being.
Chief viewpoint: establish distances, but create no antitheses.
Dissolve the intermediate forms and reduce their influence: chief
means of preserving distances.
892 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
How should one wish to spoil mediocrity for the mediocre!
As one will see, I do the opposite: every step away from it— so 1
teach—leads to immorality.10

Hatred for mediocrity is unworthy of a philosopher: it is
almost a question mark against his “right to philosophy.” Pre­
cisely because he is an exception he has to take the rule under his
protection, he has to keep the mediocre in good heart.
894 (Spring-Fall 1887)
What I fight against: that an exceptional type should make
war on the rule— instead of grasping that the continued existence
of the rule is the precondition for the value of the exception. For
example, the ladies who, instead of feeling their abnormal thirst
for scholarship as a distinction, want to disrupt the status of
woman in general.
895 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The increase of force despite the temporary decline of the
individual:
to establish a new level:
a method of assembling forces’ for the preservation of
small achievements, in opposition to uneconomic waste;
destructive nature temporarily subdued as an instrument
for this future economy;
preservation of the weak, because a tremendous number
of petty tasks have to be performed;
preservation of an attitude of mind that makes existence
still possible for the weak and suffering;
to implant solidarity as an instinct against the instinct of
fear and servility;
struggle against accident, also against the accident of “great
men.”
896 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Struggle against men justified on economic grounds. They
are dangerous, accidents, exceptions, tempests, strong enough to
call in question things slowly built and established. Explosives

should not merely be detonated harmlessly; where possible detona­
tion should be prevented: fundamental instinct of all civilized
society.
897 (Jan.-Fall 1888)
WhOver reflects upon the way in which the type man can be
raised to his greatest spendor and power will grasp first of all
that he must place himself outside morality; for morality has been
essentially directed to the opposite end: to obstruct or destroy
that spendid evolution wherever it has been going on. For such
an evolution does indeed consume so great a quantity of men in
its service that a reverse movement is only too natural: the weaker,
more delicate, intermediate existences need to take sides against
that gloriousness of life and strength; and to that end they have to
acquire a new valuation of themselves by virtue of which they
can condemn life in this highest plenitude, and where possible
destroy it. A tendency hostile to life is therefore characteristic of
morality, in so far as it wants to overpower the types of life.
898 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The strong of the future.— That which partly necessity,
partly chance has achieved here and there, the conditions for the
production of a stronger type, we are now able to comprehend
and consciously will: we are able to create the conditions under
which such an elevation is possible.
Until now, “education” has had in view the needs of society:
not the possible needs of the future, but the needs of the society
of the day. One desired to produce “tools” for it. Assuming the
wealth of force were greater, one could imagine forces being
subtracted, not to serve the needs of society but some future need.
Such a task would have to be posed the more it was grasped
to what extent the contemporary form of society was being so
powerfully transformed that at some future time it would be unable
to exist for its own sake alone, but only as a tool in the hands of
a stronger race.
The increasing dwarfing of man is precisely the driving force
that brings to mind the breeding of a stronger race— a race that
would be excessive precisely where the dwarfed species was weak

478

THE

WILL

TO P O W E R

and growing weaker (in will, responsibility, self-assurance, ability
to posit goals for oneself).
The means would be those history teaches: isolation through
interests in preservation that are the reverse of those which are
average today; habituation to reverse evaluations; distance as a
pathos; a free conscience in those things that today are most under­
valued and prohibited.
The homogenizing of European man is the great process that
cannot be obstructed: one should even hasten it. The necessity
to create a gulf, distance, order of rank, is given eo ipso— not the
necessity to retard this process.
As soon as it is established, this homogenizing species requires
a justification: it lies in serving a higher sovereign species that
stands upon the former and can raise itself to its task only by
doing this. Not merely a master race whose sole task is to rule,
but a race with its own sphere of life, with an excess of strength
for beauty, bravery, culture, manners to the highest peak of the
spirit; an affirming race that may grant itself every great luxury—
strong enough to have no need of the tyranny of the virtueimperative, rich enough to have no need of thrift and pedantry,
beyond good and evil; a hothouse for strange and choice plants.
899 (1885)
Our psychologists, whose glance lingers involuntarily on
symptoms of decadence alone, again and again induce us to
mistrust the spirit. One always sees only those effects of the spirit
that make men weak, delicate, and morbid; but now there are

I point to something new: certainly for such a democratic

who comes from the heights: a species of conquering and ruling
natures in search of material to mold. Prometheus was this kind
of barbarian,
901 (Spring-Fall 1887)™
Main consideration: not to see the task of the higher species
in leading the lower (as, e.g., Comte does), but the lower as a
base upon which higher species performs its own tasks— upon
which alone it can stand.
The conditions under which a strong and noble species main­
tains itself (regarding spiritual discipline) are the reverse of those
which govern the “industrial masses,” the shopkeepers a la Spencer.
That which is available only to the strongest and most fruit­
ful natures and makes their existence possible— leisure, adventure,
disbelief, even dissipation—would, if it were available to mediocre
natures, necessarily destroy them— and actually does. This is where
industriousness, rule, moderation, firm “conviction” have their
place— in short, the “herd virtues” : under them this intermediate
type of man grows perfect.

with him, just as he eats nothing he does not enjoy,

The happiness and self-contentment of the Lazzaroni18 or
the “bliss” of “beautiful souls” or the consumptive love of Herrnhuteristic17 pietists prove nothing regarding order of rank among
men. As a great educator, one would have to scourge such a race of
“blessed people” mercilessly into unhappiness. The danger of
dwarfing, of relaxation is present at once:— against Spinozistic or
Epicurean happiness and against all relaxation in contemplative
states. But if virtue is the means to such a happiness, very well,
then one has to become master over virtue, too*
912 (March-June 7555)
I absolutely cannot see how one can later make up for
having failed to go to a good school at the proper time. Such a
man does not know himself; he walks through life without having
learned to walk; his flabby muscles reveal themselves with every
step. Sometimes life is so merciful as to offer this hard schooling
once more later: sickness for years perhaps, that demands the
most extreme strength of will and self-sufficiency; or a sudden
calamity, affecting also one’s wife and child, that compels one to
a form of activity that restores energy to the slack fibers and
toughness to the will to live. The most desirable thing is still under
all circumstances a hard discipline at the proper time, i.e., at that
age at which it still makes one proud to see that much is de­
manded of one. For this is what distinguishes the hard school as
a good school from all others: that much is demanded; and sternly
demanded; that the good, even the exceptional, is demanded as
the norm; that praise is rare, that indulgence is nonexistent; that
blame is apportioned sharply, objectively, without regard for talent
or antecedents.
One needs such a school from every point of view: that

applies to the most physical as well as to the most spiritual matters;
it would be fatal to desire to draw a distinction here! The same
discipline makes both the good soldier and the good scholar; and
looked at more closely, there is no good scholar who does not
have the instincts of a good soldier in his makeup* To be able to
command and also proudly to obey; to stand in the ranks, but also
capable at any time of leading; to prefer danger to comfort; not
to weigh the permitted and the forbidden on a shopkeeper’s
scales; to be a foe more of the petty, sly, parasitic, than of the
evil.— What does one learn in a hard school? Obeying and com­
manding.

I also want to make asceticism natural again: in place of
the aim of denial, the aim of strengthening; a gymnastics of the
will; abstinence and periods of fasting of all kinds, in the most
spiritual realm, too; a casuistry of deeds in regard to the opinions
we have regarding our strengths; an experiment with adventures
and arbitrary dangers. (Diners chez Magny: nothing but spiri­
tual gourmets with indigestion.10) — One should even devise
tests for one’s strength in being able to keep one’s word.

1. asceticism: one has hardly the courage so far to display
its natural utility, its indispensability in the service of the education
of the will. Our absurd pedagogic world, before which the “useful
civil servant” hovers as a model, thinks it can get by with “in­
struction,” with brain drill; it has not the slightest idea that
something else is needed first—education of will power; one
devises tests for everything except for the main thing: whether
one can will, whether one may promise; the young man finishes
school without a single question, without any curiosity even, con­
cerning this supreme value-problem of his nature;
2. fasting: in every sense— even as a means of preserving
the delicacy of one's ability to enjoy all good things (e.g., occasion­
ally to stop reading, listening to music, being pleasant; one must
have fast days for one’s virtues, too);
3. the "monastery'V temporary isolation, accompanied by
strict refusal, e.g,, of letters; a kind of most profound self-reflection
and self-recovery that desires to avoid, not “temptations,” but
“duties” : an escape from the daily round; a detachment from
the tyranny of stimuli and influences that condemns us to spend our
strength in nothing but reactions and does not permit their accu­
mulation to the point of spontaneous activity (one should observe
our scholars from close up: they think only reactively; i.e,, they
have to read before they can think);
4. feasts: One has to be very coarse in order not to feel the
presence of Christians and Christian values as an oppression
beneath which all genuine festive feelings go to the devil. Feasts
include: pride, exuberance, wantonness; mockery of everything
serious and Philistine; a divine affirmation of oneself out of animal
plenitude and perfection— one and all states which the Christian
cannot honestly welcome. The feast is paganism par excellence;
5. courage confronted with one’s own nature: dressing up in
"moral" costumes,— That one has no need of moral formulas in
order to welcome an affect; standard: how far we can affirm what
is nature in us—how much or how little we need to have recourse
to morality;
6. death.— One must convert the stupid physiological fact
into a moral necessity. So to live that one can also will at the right
time to die!™*

To feel stronger—or in other words, joy— always presupposes
a comparison (but not necessarily with others, but with oneself in
the midst of a state of growth and without one’s first knowing
in how far one is making comparisons— ).
Artificial strengthening: whether by stimulating chemicals or
by stimulating errors (“delusions” ):
e.g., the feeling of security such as a Christian possesses; he
feels strong in being able to trust, to be patient and composed:
he owes this artificial strength to the illusion of being protected
by a god;
e.g., the feeling of superiority: as when the caliph of Morocco
is allowed to see only globes upon which his three united kingdoms
occupy four-fifths of the surface;
e.g., the feeling of uniqueness: as when the European imagines
that the march of culture takes place in Europe, and when he
seems to himself to be a kind of abridged world process; or when
the Christian makes all existence in general revolve around the
“salvation of man.”
— It is a question of where one feels the pressure, the con­
straint: according to where this is, a different feeling of being
stronger will be produced. A philosopher, e.g., feels in the midst
of the coolest, most transmontane abstraction acrobatics like a fish
in water, while colors and tones oppress him; to say nothing of the
dim desires— that which others call “the ideal.”

slowly; and by clinging tenaciously to what one has decided.
Everything else follows.
The sudden and the changeable: the two species of weakness.
Not to mistake oneself for one of them; to feel the distance—

Beware of the good-natured! Association with them makes

weapons of defense and offense that reside in one’s instincts. All
one’s inventiveness toward testing one’s strength of will— To see
the distinguishing feature in this, and not in knowledge, astuteness,

One must learn in time to command—just as much as to
obey. One must learn modesty, tact in modesty: that is, to confer
distinction and to honor by being modest; the same with trust—.
to confer distinction, to honor.

For what does one have to atone most? For one’s modesty;
for having failed to listen to one’s most personal requirements;
for having mistaken oneself; for having underestimated oneself;
for having lost a good ear for one’s instincts: this lack of reverence
for oneself revenges itself through every kind of deprivation:
health, friendship, well-being, pride, cheerfulness, freedom, firm­
ness, courage. One never afterward forgives oneself for this lack
of genuine egoism: one takes it for an objection, for a doubt about
a real ego.

I wish men would begin by respecting themselves: everything
else follows from that. To be sure, as soon as one does this one is
finished for others: for this is what they forgive last: “What? A
man who respects himself?”—
This is something different from the blind drive to love
oneself: nothing is more common, in the love of the sexes as well
as of that duality which is called “I,” than contempt for what
one loves:— fatalism in love.

The means by which a stronger species maintains itself.
To grant oneself the right to exceptional actions; as an ex­

To venture into states in which it is not permitted not to be
a barbarian.
To create control and certainty in regard to one’s strength
of will through asceticism of every kind.
Not to communicate oneself; silence; bewaring of charm.20
To learn obedience in such a way that it provides a test of
one’s self-support. Casuistry of honor taken to the greatest
extreme of subtlety.
Never to conclude “what is right for one is fair for another”—
but conversely!
To treat requital, the permission to give back, as a privilege
and a rare distinction.
To have no ambition to emulate the virtues of others.
922 (Spring-Fall 1887)
What means one has to employ with rude peoples, and that
“barbarous” means are not arbitrary and capricious, becomes

The warlike and the peaceful.— Are you a man with the
instincts of a warrior iii your system? If so, a second question
arises: are you by instinct a warrior of attack or a warrior of
defense? The remainder of mankind, all that is not warlike by
instinct, wants peace, wants concord, wants “freedom,” wants
“equal rights” : these are only different names and stages of the
same thing. To go where one has no need to defend oneself—

such men become dissatisfied with themselves if they are obliged
to offer resistance: [they want to]21 create conditions in which
there is no longer war of any kind. If the worst comes to the
worst, to submit, obey, acquiesce: anything is better than waging
war— thus, e.g., does a Christian’s instinct counsel him. In the case
of the bom warrior, there is something like armament in his
character, in his choice of states, in the development of every
quality: in the first type, it is the “weapon” that is developed best,
in the latter the armor.
The unarmed, the unarmored: what expedients and virtues
they need in order to endure— to triumph.

Marginal note on a niaiserie anglaise.22— “Do not unto others
what you would not have them do unto you.” That counts as
wisdom; that counts as prudence; that counts as the basis of
morality— as the “golden rule.” John Stuart Mill believes in it
(and what Englishman does not?) But this rule does not brook
the slightest attack. The calculation, “do nothing that ought not
to be done to you,” prohibits actions on account of their harm­
ful consequences: the concealed premise is that an action will
always be requited. But what if someone holding the Principe23
in his hand were to say: “It is precisely such actions that one
must perform, to prevent others from performing them first—
to deprive others of the chance to perform them on us”1
On the other hand: let us consider a Corsican whose honor
demands a vendetta. He does not want a bullet in his body either;

him from vindicating his honor— And in all decent actions, are
we not deliberately indifferent to the prospect of what may happen
to us? To avoid an action that might have harmful consequences
for us— that would mean a ban on decent actions in general.
Nonetheless, the rule is valuable because it betrays a type of
man: it is the instinct of the herd that finds its formula in this
rule—one is equal, one takes oneself for equal: as I to you,
thus you to me.— Here there is a real belief in an equivalence of
actions that in all actual circumstances simply does not exist. Not
every action can be returned: between actual “individuals” there
are no equal actions, consequently no “requital”— When I do
something, I am very far from thinking that anyone else can do
much the same: it belongs to me— One cannot pay me back, it
will always :be “another” action that is perpetrated against me.—
926 (NOV, 1887-March 1888)
Against John Stuart Mill.— I abhor his vulgarity, which
says: “What is right for one is fair for another” ; “what you would
not, etc., do not unto others”; which wants to establish all human
intercourse on the basis of mutual services, so that every action
appears as a kind of payment for something done to us. The
presupposition here is ignoble in the lowest sense: here an equiv­
alence of value between my actions and yours is presupposed; here
the most personal value of an action is simply annulled (that
which cannot be balanced or paid in any way— ).
“Reciprocity” is a piece of gross vulgarity; precisely that
something I do may not and could not be done by another, that
no balance is possible (— except in the most select sphere of
“my equals,” inter pares— ), that in a deeper sense one never
gives back, because one is something unique and does only
unique things— this fundamental conviction contains the cause of
aristocratic segregation from the masses, because the masses be­
lieve in “equality” and consequently in equivalence and “reci­
procity.”

The parochial narrowness of moral valuation with its “useful”

spective of society, which is able to survey only the close and
closest in regard to consequences.
The state and the politician already have need of a more
supra-moral attitude, because they have to reckon with a much
greater complexity of effects.
A world economy would also be possible with such distant
perspectives that all its individual demands might seem unjust and
arbitrary at the moment.
928 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
“Should one follow one's feelings?’’— That one should put
one’s life in danger, yielding to a generous feeling and under the
impulse o f a moment, that is of little value and does not even
characterize one. Everyone is equally capable of that—and in
this resolution, a criminal, a bandit, and a Corsican certainly excel
decent people.
A higher stage is: to overcome even this pressure within us
and to perform a heroic act not on impulse—-but coldly, raisonnable,
without being overwhelmed by stormy feelings of pleasure-— The
same applies to compassion: it must first be habitually sifted by
reason; otherwise it is just as dangerous as any other affect.
Blind indulgence of an affect, totally regardless o f whether it
be a generous and compassionate or a hostile affect, is the cause
of the greatest evils.
Greatness of character does not consist in not possessing
these affects— on the contrary, one possesses them to the highest
degree— but in having them under control. And even that without
any pleasure in this restraint, but merely because—

“To give one’s life for a cause”— a great effect. But there are
many things for which one would give one’s life: the affects one

or revenge— that one stakes one’s life on it does not make any
value difference. How many have sacrified their lives for pretty
girls— and, worse, even their health! If one has the temperament,
one instinctively chooses what is dangerous; e.g., adventures in
speculation if one is a philosopher; or in immorality if one is

virtuous. One kind of man will risk nothing, another wants risks.
Are we others despisers of life? On the contrary, we seek life raised
to a higher power, life lived in danger— 24 But that, to repeat it,
does not mean we want to be more virtuous than others. Pascal,
e.g., wanted to risk nothing25 and remained a Christian: perhaps
that was virtuous.-;- One always makes sacrifices.
930 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
How much advantage man sacrifices, how little “self-in­
terested” he is! All his affects and passions demand their rights—
and how remote from the prudent utility of self-interest is an
affect!
One does not desire “happiness” ; one must be English to
be able to believe that man always seeks his advantage.26 Our
desires want to violate things with a? protracted passion— their
accumulated strength seeks resistance.
931 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The affects are one and all useful, some directly, others
indirectly; in regard to utility it is quite impossible to fix any
scale of values—even though in economic terms the forces of
nature are one and all good, i.e., useful, and also the source of so
much terrible and irrevocable fatality. The most one could say is
that the most powerful affects are the most valuable, in as much
as there are no greater sources of strength.

Well-meaning, helpful, good-natured attitudes of mind have
not come to be honored on account of their usefulness, but
because they are states of richer souls that are capable of bestowing
and have their value in the feeling of the plenitude of life. Observe
the eyes of benefactors: what one sees is the antithesis of selfdenial, of hatred for the mot, of “Pascalism.”
933 (Spring-Fall 1887)
In Summa: domination of the passions, not their weakening or
extirpation!— The greater the dominating power of a will, the
more freedom may the passions be allowed.
The “great man” is great owing to the free play and scope
of his desires and to the yet greater power that knows how to
press these magnificent monsters into service.
The “good man” is at every stage of civilization the harmless
and the useful combined: a kind of mean; the expression of the
general consciousness of the kind of man whom one has no
reason to fear but whom one must nonetheless not despise.
Education: essentially the means of ruining the exceptions
for the good of the rule.27 Higher education:28 essentially the means
of directing taste against the exceptions for the good of the mediocre.
Only when a culture has an excess of powers at its disposal
can it also constitute a hothouse for the luxury cultivation of the
exception, the experiment, of danger, of the nuance:— this is the
tendency of every aristocratic culture.

the rule, the commonplace, the petty, good, upright, the average

Aristocracy. Herd-animal ideals— now culminating as the
highest value standard of “society” : attempt to give them a cosmic,
even a metaphysical value.— Against them I defend aristocracy.
A society that preserves a regard and delicatesse for freedom
must feel itself to be an exception and must confront a power from
which it distinguishes itself, toward which it is hostile, and on
which it looks down.
The more I relinquish my rights and level myself down, the
more I come under the dominion of the average and finally of
the majority. The presupposition inherent in an aristocratic society
for preserving a high degree of freedom among its members is
the extreme tension that arises from the presence of an antagonistic
drive in all its members: the will to dominate—

Augustin Thierry read in 1814 what De Montlosier had said

of indignation and commenced his work* That emigrant had said:
Race d’affranchis, race d’esclaves arracMs de nos mains, peuple
tributaire, peuple nouveau, licence vous fut octroyee d’itre libres,
et non pas a nous d ’etre nobles; pour nous tout est de droit, pour
vous tout est de grace, nous ne sommes point de votre communautt;
nous sommes un tout par nous-mSmes.32

How the aristocratic world increasingly bleeds itself and
makes itself weaker! Because of the nobility of its instincts it
throws away its privileges and because of the refinement of its
hyper-culture it takes an interest in the people, the weak, the
poor, the poetry of the petty, etc.
939 (1885-1886)
There is a noble and dangerous carelessness that permits a
profound inference and insight: the carelessness of the self-assured
and overrich soul that has never troubled about friends but
knows only hospitality, and practices, and knows how to practice,
“ ‘Tribe of freedmen, tribes of slaves torn from our hands, tributary
people, new people, license has been granted to you to be free, but not to
us to be noble; for us everything is a right; for you everything is a matter
of grace; we are not part of your community; we are entire by ourselves.”

only hospitality—heart and home open to anyone who cares to
enter, whether beggar or cripple or king. This is genuine geniality:
whoever has that, has a hundred “friends” but in all probability not
a single friend.

The teaching nieden agan 33 applies to men of overflowing
strength— not to the mediocre. The enkrateia34 and askesis35 is
only a stage toward the heights: the “golden nature” is higher.
“Thou shalt”— unconditional obedience in Stoics, in the
Christian and Arab orders, in the philosophy of Kant (it is im­
material whether to a superior or to a concept).
Higher than “thou shalt” is “I will” (the heroes); higher
than “I will” stands: “I am” (the gods of the Greeks),
The barbarian gods express nothing of the pleasure of re­
straint—are neither simple nor frivolous nor moderate.
941 (Summer-Fall 1883)
The meaning of our gardens and palaces (and to this extent
also the meaning of all desire for riches) is: to remove disorder
and vulgarity from sight and to build a home for nobility of soul.
The majority, to be sure, believe they will acquire higher
natures when those beautiful, peaceful objects have operated upon
them: hence the rush to go to Italy and on travels, etc.; all reading
and visits to theatres. They want to have themselves formed—
that is the meaning of their cultural activity! But the strong, the
mighty want to form and no longer to have anything foreign about
them!
Thus men also plunge into wild nature, not to find themselves
but to lose and forget themselves in it. “To be outside oneself*

— An ironic response to the “talented,” the belief in a
nobility by birth in moral matters too.
— Always to experience oneself as one who bestows honors,
while there are not many fit to honor one.
— Always disguised: the higher the type, the more a man
requires an incognito. If God existed, he would, merely on grounds
of decency, be obliged to show himself to the world only as a man.
—The ability for otium,41 the unconditional conviction that
although a craft in any sense does not dishonor, it certainly takes
away nobility. No “industriousness” in the bourgeois sense, how­
ever well we may know how to honor and reward it, or like those
insatiably cackling artists who act like hens, cackle and lay eggs
and cackle again.
— We protect artists and poets and those who are masters in
anything; but as natures that are of a higher kind than these, who
have only the ability to do something, merely “productive men,”
we do not confound ourselves with them.
— Pleasure in forms; taking under protection everything
formal, the conviction that politeness is one of the greatest virtues;
mistrust for letting oneself go in any way, including all freedom
o f press and thought, because under them the spirit grows com­
fortable and doltish and relaxes its limbs.
— Delight in women, as in a perhaps smaller but more deli­
cate and ethereal kind of creature. What joy to encounter creatures
who have only dancing, foolishness, and finery in their heads!
They have been the delight of every very tense and profound male
soul whose life was weighed down with great responsibilities.
— Pleasure in princes and priests, because they preserve the
belief in differences in human values even in the valuation of the
past, at least symbolically and on the whole even actually.
— Ability to keep silent: but not a word about that in the
presence of listeners.
— Endurance of protracted enmities: lack of easy recon­
cilability.

A question constantly keeps coming back to us, a seductive
and wicked question perhaps: may it be whispered into the ears

of those who have a right to such questionable questions, the
strongest souls of today, whose best control is over themselves: is
it not time, now that the type “herd animal” is being evolved more
and more in Europe, to make the experiment Of a fundamental,
artificial and conscious breeding of the opposite type and its
virtues? A nd would it not be a kind of goal, redemption, and
justification for the democratic movement itself if someone arrived
who could make use of it— by finally producing beside its new
and sublime development of slavery (— that is what European
democracy must become ultimately) a higher kind of dominating
and Caesarian spirits who would stand upon it, maintain themselves
by it, and elevate themselves through it? To new, hitherto impos­
sible prospects, to their own prospects? To their own tasks?
955 (1885)
To view the contemporary European makes me very hopeful:
an audacious ruling race is developing on the basis of an extremely
intelligent herd mass. It will not be long before the movement for
the cultivation of the latter will no longer have the foreground all
to itself.
956 (7555)
The same conditions that hasten the evolution of the herd
animal also hasten the evolution of the leader animal.
957 (1885)
Inexorably, hesitantly, terrible as fate, the great task and
question is approaching: how shall the earth as a whole be gov­
erned? And to what end shall “man” as a whole— and no longer as.
a people, a race—be raised and trained?
Law-giving moralities are the principal means of fashioning
man according to the pleasure of a creative and profound will,
provided that such an artist’s will of the first rank has the power
in its hands and can make its creative will prevail through long
periods of time, in the form of laws, religions, and customs. Such
men of great creativity, the really great men according to my under­
standing, will be sought in vain today and probably for a long

time to come: they are lacking; until, after much disappointment,
one must begin to comprehend why they are lacking and that
nothing stands more malignantly in the way of their rise and evolu­
tion, today and for a long time to come, than what in Europe
today is called simply “morality”— as if there were no other
morality and could be no other—the aforementioned herd-animal
morality which is striving with all its power44 for a universal
green-pasture happiness on earth, namely for security, absence of
danger, comfort, the easy life, and ultimately, “if all goes well,”
hopes to do away with any kind of shepherd or bellwhether. The
two doctrines it preaches most often are: '‘equal rights” and
“sympathy With all that suffers”— and it takes suffering itself to be
something that must absolutely be abolished. That such “ideas”
as these are still modem gives one a bad opinion of modernity.
Whoever has thought profoundly about where and how the
plant man has hitherto grown most vigorously must conclude that
this has happened under the reverse conditions: that the danger­
ousness o f his situation must grow to tremendous proportions,
that his power of invention and dissembling must struggle up be­
neath protracted oppression and compulsion, that his will to live
must be enhanced to an unconditional will to power and to over­
power, and that danger, severity, violence, danger in the street as
well as in the heart, inequality of rights, concealment, stoicism, the
art of experiment, devilry of all kinds, in short the opposite of all
the herd thinks desirable, are necessary for the elevation of the type
man. A morality with such reverse intentions, which desires to
train men for the heights, not for comfort and mediocrity, a
morality with the intention of training a ruling caste— the future
masters of the earth— must, if it is to be taught, appear in as­
sociation with the prevailing moral laws, in the guise of their
terms and forms. That for this, however, many transitional means
of deception must be devised, and that, because the lifetime of a
single man signifies virtually nothing in relation to the accomplish­
ment of such protracted tasks and aims, the very first thing to be
done is the rearing of a new kind of man, in whom the duration
of the necessary will and the necessary instinct will be guaranteed
through many generations— a new master type and caste— all this

this point—and this note was evidently dictated (it is in another hand) and

is as obvious as is the protracted and not easily expressible etcetera
of this idea.
To prepare a reversal of values for a certain strong kind of
man of the highest spirituality and strength of will and to this
end slowly and cautiously to unfetter a host of instincts now kept
in check and calumniated— whoever reflects on this becomes one
of us, the free spirits— to be sure, a different kind of “free spirit”
from those before us; for the latter wanted approximately the op­
posite of what we do. To us, it seems to me, belong above all the
pessimists of Europe, the poets and thinkers of an enraged idealism,
in so far as their discontent with all existence involved them at
least by logical necessity in a discontent with present-day man;
also certain insatiably ambitious artists who unhesitatingly and
unconditionally fight for the special rights of higher men and against
the “herd animal” and who, by means of the seductions of art, lull
to sleep all herd instincts and herd cautiousness in Choice spirits;
thirdly and finally all those critics and historians who courageously
carry forward the happily-begun discovery of the world of anti­
quity—it is the work of the new Columbus, the German spirit
(for we still stand at the beginning of this conquest). For in the
world of antiquity there reigned a different, more lordly morality
than today; and the man of antiquity, raised in this morality, was a
stronger and deeper man than the man of today— he alone has
hitherto been “the man that has turned out well.” But the seductive
power that antiquity exercises on such well-turned-out, i.e., strong
and enterprising, souls is the most subtle and effective of all anti­
democratic and anti-Christian influences even today, as at the
time of the Renaissance.

From now on there will be more favorable preconditions for
more comprehensive forms of dominion, whose like has never
yet existed. And even this is not the most important thing; the
possibility has been established for the production of international
racial unions whose task will be to rear a master race, the future
“masters of the earth” ;— a new, tremendous aristocracy, based on
the severest self-legislation, in which the will of philosophical men
of power and artist-tyrants will be made to endure for millenia—
a higher kind of man who, thanks to their superiority in will,
knowledge, riches, and influence, employ democratic Europe as
their most pliant and supple instrument for getting hold of the
destinies of the earth, so as to work as artists upon “man” himself.

962 (1885)
A great man— a man whom nature has constructed and in­
vented in the grand style—what is he?
First: there is a long logic in all of his activity, hard to survey
because of its length, and consequently misleading; he has the
ability to extend his will across great stretches of his life and to
despise and reject everything petty about him, including even
the fairest, “divinest” things in the world.
Secondly: he is colder, harder, less hesitating, and without
fear of “opinion”; he lacks the virtues that accompany respect
and “respectability,” and altogether everything that is part of the
“virtue of the herd.” If he cannot lead, he goes alone; then it
can happen that he may snarl at some things he meets on his way.
Third: he wants no “sympathetic” heart, but servants, tools;
in his intercourse with men he is always intent on making some­
thing out of them. He knows he is incommunicable: he finds it
tasteless to be familiar; and when one thinks he is, he usually is
not. When not speaking to himself, he wears a mask. He rather
lies than tells the truth: it requires more spirit and will.*7 There is
a solitude within him that is inaccessible to praise or blame, his
own justice that is beyond appeal.
963 (Spring-Fall 1887)
The great man is necessarily a skeptic48 (which is not to say
that he has to appear to be one), provided that greatness consists in
this: to will something great and the means to it. Freedom from
any kind of conviction is part of the strengh of his will. Thus
it accords with that “englightened despotism” exercised by every
great passion. Such a passion takes the intellect into its service*,
it has the courage even for unholy means; it removes scruples;
it permits itself convictions, it even needs them, but it does not
submit to them. The need for faith, for anything unconditional
i1The theme of the mask and the need for masks is more fully developed
in Beyond Good and Evil. For the many relevant passages see the index to
my translation (New York: Vintage Books, 1966).

in Yes and No, is a proof of weakness; all weakness is weakness
of will. The man of faith, the believer, is necessarily a small type
of man. Hence “freedom of spirit,” i.e., unbelief as an instincl
[is a precondition of greatness. ]ia
964 (1884)
The great man feels his power over a people, his temporary
coincidence with a people or a millenium; this enlargement in his
experience of himself as causa and voluntas is misunderstood as
“altruism”; it drives him to seek means of communication: all
great men are inventive in such means. They want to embed
themselves in great communities; they want to give a single form
to the multifarious and disordered; chaos stimulates them.
Misunderstanding of love. There is a slavish love that submits
and gives itself; that idealizes, and deceives itself— there is a
divine love that despises and loves, and reshapes and elevates the
beloved.
To gain that tremendous energy of greatness in order to
shape the man of the future through breeding and, on the other
hand, the annihilation of millions of failures, and not to perish
of the suffering one creates, though nothing like it has ever
existed!—
965 (1884)
The revolution, confusion, and distress of peoples is, in my
view, inferior to the distress of great individuals during their
development. One must not let oneself be deceived: the many
distresses of all the small constitute a sum only in the feelings of
powerful human beings.— To think of oneself in moments of
great danger, to derive advantage from the disadvantage of many:
this can be, in the case of a very high degree of deviation, a sign
of a great character who manages to master his compassionate
and just impulses.
966 (1884)
In contrast to the animals, man has cultivated an abundance
"T he words I have placed in brackets were added by the German
editors.

book fo u r :

507

of contrary drives and impulses within himself: thanks to this
synthesis, he is master of the earth.— Moralities are the expression
of locally limited orders of rank in his multifarious world of
drives, so man should not perish through their contradictions.
Thus a drive as master, its opposite weakened, refined, as the
impulse that provides the stimulus for the activity of the chief
drive.
The highest man would have the greatest multiplicity of
drives, in the relatively greatest strength that can be endured.
Indeed, where the plant “man” shows himself strongest one finds
instincts that conflict powerfully (e.g., in Shakespeare), but are
controlled.
967 (1885)
Whether one does not have the right to account all great
men evil? This cannot be shown in a pure state in all individual
cases. Often they have been capable of masterly dissimulation
and assumed the outward forms and gestures of great virtues.
Often they honored virtue seriously and with a passionate hard­
ness against themselves, but out of cruelty: seen from a distance,
this is deceptive. Many misunderstood themselves; not infrequently
a great task calls forth great qualities, e.g., justice. The essential
point is: the greatest perhaps also possess great virtues, but in
that case also their opposites. I believe that it is precisely through
the presence of opposites and the feelings they occasion that the
great man, the bow with the great tension, develops.
968 (1886-1887)
In great men, the specific qualities of life— injustice, false­
hood, exploitation— are at their greatest. But in so far as they
have had an overwhelming effect, their essence has been most
misunderstood and interpreted as goodness. Type: Carlyle as
interpreter.80
“ Cutting remarks about Carlyle are also found in The Gay Science,
section 97 (“Garrulity from inner satisfaction with noise and confused
feelings; e.g., in Carlyle”); in Beyond Good and Evil, section 252; in Twi­
light, “Skirmishes,” sections 1 and 12 (he is also mentioned in section 44);
in The Antichrist, section 54; and in sections 27, 312, 343, 455, 747 above.

969 (Spring-Fall 1887)
In general, every thing is worth as much as one has paid for
i t This does not hold, to be sure, if one takes the individual in
isolation; the great capabilities of the individual are utterly out
of proportion to what he himself has done, sacrificed, and suffered
for them. But if one considers his family history, one discovers
the history of a tremendous storing up and capital accumulation
of strength through all kinds of renunciation, struggle, work, and
prevailing. It is because the great man has cost so much, and not
because he appears as a miracle and gift of heaven and “chance,”
that he has become great: “heredity” a false concept. One’s
forebears have paid the price for what one is.

970 (1883-1888)
Danger in modesty.— To adapt ourselves too early to the
tasks, societies, everyday life and everyday work, in which chance
has placed us, at a time when neither our strength nor our goal
has yet entered our consciousness with the force of law; the alltoo-early certainty of conscience, comfortableness, sociability thus
achieved, this premature resignation that insinuates itself into our
feelings as a release from inner and outer unrest, pampers and
holds one back in the most dangerous fashion. To learn to feel
respect after the fashion of “those like us,1’ as if we ourselves had
no measure in us and no right to determine values; the effort to
evaluate as others do, against the inner voice of our taste, which is
also a form of conscience, becomes a terrible, subtle constraint:
if there is not finally an explosion, with a sudden bursting asunder
of all the bonds of love and morality, then such a spirit becomes
withered, petty, effeminate, and factual.
The opposite is bad enough, but better nonetheless: to suffer
from one’s environment, from its praise as well as from its blame,
wounded by it and festering inwardly without betraying the fact;
to defend oneself with involuntary mistrust against its love, to
learn silence, perhaps concealing it behind speech,51 to create for
oneself nooks and undiscoverable solitudes for moments of relief,

of tears, of sublime consolation—until one is finally strong enough
to say, “what do I have to do with you?" and to go one’s own way.
971 (Nov. 1887-March 1888)
Men who are destinies, who by bearing themselves bear
destinies, the whole species of heroic bearers of burdens: oh how
they would like to rest from themselves for once! how they thirst
for strong hearts and necks, so as to be free from what oppresses
them, at least for a few hours! And how vainly they thirst!— They
wait; they look at everything that passes: no one approaches them
with as much as a thousandth part of their suffering02 and passion,53
no one divines in what way they are waiting— At length, at length
they learn their first piece of worldly prudence—not to wait any
more; and soon another one: to be genial, to be modest, from now
on to endure everyone, to endure everything—in short, to endure
even a little more than they have endured so far.

6. The Highest Man as Legislator
of the Future
972M (1884)
Legislators of the future.— After having tried in vain for a
long time to attach a definite concept to the word “philosopher”—
for I found many contradictory characteristics— I recognized at
last that there are two distinct kinds of philosopher:
1. those who want to ascertain a complex fact of evaluations
(logical or m oral);
2. those who are legislators of such evaluations.
The former try to master the world of the present or the
past by concentrating and abridging the multiplicity of events
through signs: their aim is to make previous events surveyable,

comprehensible, graspable, and usable— they assist the task of
man to employ all past things for the benefit of his future.
The latter, however, are commanders; they say: “Thus it shall
be!” They alone determine the “whither” and the “wherefore,”
what is useful and what constitutes utility for men; they dispose of
the preparatory work of scientific men, and all knowledge is for
them only a means for creation. This second kind of philosopher
rarely prospers; and their situation and danger is indeed fearful.
How often they have deliberately blindfolded themselves simply so
as not to have to behold the narrow ledge that separates them from
a plunge into the abyss; e.g., Plato, when he convinced himself
that the “good” as he desired it was not the good of Plato but
the “good in itself,” the eternal treasure that some man, named
Plato, had chanced to discover on his way! This same will to
blindness dominates the founders of religions in a much coarser
form: their “thou shalt” must not by any means sound in their ears
like “I will”— they dare to fulfill their task only as the command
of a god; only as an “inspiration” is their value legislation a
bearable burden under which their conscience is not crushed.
As soon as these two means of comfort, that of Plato and that
of Mohammed, have fallen away and no thinker can relieve his
conscience with the hypothesis of a “god” or “eternal values,” the
claim of the legislator of new values rises to a new fearfulness
never yet attained. From then on, those elect on whom the
suspicion of having such a duty begins to dawn, try to see if
they cannot, “at the right moment,” elude it, as their greatest
danger, through some kind of detour; for example, by convincing
themselves that the task has already been accomplished, or cannot
be accomplished, or that their shoulders are not strong enough for
such burdens, or that they are already overburdened with other,
more immediate tasks, or that even this new, distant duty is a
seduction and temptation, drawing them away from all other duties,
a sickness, a kind of madness. Many may indeed succeed in
eluding it: history is full of the traces of men who have eluded
this task, and of their bad consciences. Usually, however, there
came to these men of fate that redeeming hour, that autumnal
hour of ripeness, in which they had to do what they did not even
“want” to do— and the deed of which they had hitherto been most
afraid fell easily and unsought from the tree, as an involuntary
deed, almost as a gift.—

973 (1885)
The human horizon.— One can conceive philosophers as
those who make the most extreme efforts to test how far man could
elevate himself— Plato especially: how far his strength will reach.
But they do it as individuals; perhaps the instinct of the Caesars,
of founders of states, etc., was greater, as they pondered how far
man might be driven in his evolution and under “favorable con­
ditions.” But they had an insufficient understanding of the nature
of favorable circumstances. Great question: where has the plant
“man” hitherto grown up most magnificently? For this question
the study of comparative history is necessary.
974 (Fall 1888)
A fact, a work is eloquent in a new way for every age and
every new type of man. History always enunciates new truths.
975 (1885-1886)
To remain objective, hard, firm, severe in carrying through
an idea—artists succeed best in this; but when one needs men
for this (as teachers, statesmen, etc., do), then the repose and
coldness and hardness soon vanish. With natures like Caesar
and Napoleon, one gets some notion of “disinterested” work on
their marble, whatever the cost in men. On this road lies the future
of the highest men: to bear the greatest responsibility and not
collapse under it.— Hitherto, the delusions of inspiration were
almost always needed in, order not to lose one’s faith in one’s right
and one’s hand.
976 (1884)
Why the philosopher rarely turns out well. His requirements
include qualities that usually destroy a man:
1. a tremendous multiplicity of qualities; he must be a brief
abstract of man, of all man’s higher and lower desires:
danger from antitheses, also from disgust at himself;
2. he must be inquisitive in the most various directions:
danger of going to pieces;

512

THE

3. he must be just and fair in the highest sense, but pro­
found in love, hate (and injustice), too;
4. he must be not only a spectator, but also a legislator:
judge and judged (to the extent that he is a brief abstract
of the w orld);
5. extremely multifarious, yet firm and hard. Supple.
977 (7555)
The really royal calling of the philosopher (as expressed by
Alcuin the Anglo-Saxon): prava corrigere, et recta corroborare,
et sancta sublimare
978 (1885)
The new philosopher can arise only in conjunction with a
ruling caste, as its highest spiritualization. Great politics, rule over
the earth, are at hand; complete lack of the principles that are
needed.
979 (1885)
Fundamental thought: the new values must first be created—
we shall not be spared this task! For us the philosopher must be
a legislator. New types, (How the highest types hitherto [e.g.,
Greeks] were reared: to will this type of “chance” consciously.)
980™ (1885)
Assuming one thinks of a philosopher as a great educator,
powerful enough to draw up to his lonely height a long chain
of generations, then one must also grant him the uncanny privi­
leges of the great educator. An educator never says what he
himself thinks, but always only what he thinks of a thing in
relation to the requirements of those he educates. He must not
be detected in this dissimulation; it is part of his mastery that one
believes in his honesty. He must be capable of employing every
means of discipline:57 some he can drive toward the heights only
55To correct what is wrong, and strengthen the right, and raise what
is holy.

with the whips of scorn; others, who are slugglish, irresolute,
cowardly, vain, perhaps only with exaggerated praise. Such an
educator is beyond good and evil; but no one must know it.
981 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Not to make men “better,” not to preach morality to them
in any form, as if “morality in itself,” or any ideal kind of man,
were given; but to create conditions that require stronger men
who for their part need, and consequently will have, a morality
(more clearly: a physical-spiritual discipline) that makes them
strong!
Not to allow oneself to be misled by blue eyes or heaving
bosoms: greatness of soul38 has nothing romantic about it. And
unfortunately nothing at all amiable.
982 (1884)
One must learn from war: (1) to associate death with the
interests for which one fights— that makes us venerable; (2 ) one

self force and cunning in war.

Greatness of soul is inseparable from greatness of spirit.60
For it involves independence; but in the absence of spiritual
greatness, independence ought not to be allowed, it causes mischief,
even through its desire to do good and practice “justice.” Small
spirits must obey— hence cannot possess greatness.
985 (1885)
The higher philosophical man, who has solitude not because
he wishes to be alone but because he is something that finds no
equals: what dangers and new sufferings have been reserved for
him precisely today, when one has unlearned belief in order of
rank and consequently does not know how to honor and under­
stand this solitude! Formerly the sage almost sanctified himself
in the mind of the crowd by going apart in this way— today the
hermit sees himself surrounded as if by a cloud of gloomy doubts
and suspicions. And not merely on the part of the envious and
Christianity, translated by E. B. Ashton (Chicago, Henry Regnery, 1961),
the end of the section on uSelf-Identification with the Opponent0; and Kaufmann, “Jaspers* Relation to Nietzsche,” in From Shakespeare to Existen­
tialism (Garden City: Doubleday Anchor Books, 1960, p. 300). In a
nutshell: for Jaspers this phrase represents one of “the most amazing at­
tempts to bring together again into a higher unity what [Nietzsche] has
first separated and opposed to each other , . . Nietzsche imagines—without
any power of vision and unrealizably—the synthesis of the ultimate opposi­
tion.” For me the same phrase represents “the very heart of Nietzsche’s
vision of the overman. Being capable of both sympathy and hardness, of
loving and ruling, not using claws though having them . . .”
00Seelengrdsse nicht zu trennen von geistiger Grosse. This is one of
the occasional passages in which it is tempting to translate Geist and geistig
as intellect and intellectual; for these would come closer to Nietzsche’s mean­
ing here. It is important to realize that when Nietzsche uses these terms he
generally means neither spirit alone nor intellect alone but also mind, wit,
and esprit, But if we used spirit in one passage, wit in another, intellect in
a third, and mind elsewhere, something of considerable importance would
be lost. It seems better to ask the reader to kep in mind what Geist means,
and that “spirit” always stands for Geist.'
This whole matter, of course, transcends philological niceties; what is
at stake is one of the most crucial points of Nietzsche’s philosophy: he was
not an irrationalist. And all the men he most admired were, without excep­
tion, great intellects—but not merely great intellects. Cf. sections 876 ff
above.

wretched: he must sense misunderstanding, neglect, and super­
ficiality even in all benevolence shown him. He knows that
crafty cunning of narrow-minded pity that feels itself good and
holy when it tries to “save” him from himself, perhaps by means
of more comfortable situations or more orderly, more reliable
company— indeed, he will have to admire the unconscious instinct
of destruction with which all the spiritually mediocre go to work
against him, with a perfect faith in their right to do so!
It is necessary for these men of incomprehensible loneliness to
wrap themselves vigorously and boldly in the cloak of external,
spatial solitude, too: that is part of their prudence. Even cunning
and disguise are needed today if such a man is to preserve him­
self, to keep himself aloft, in the midst of the dangerous, downdragging currents of the age. Every attempt to endure in the
present, to endure the present, every approach to the men and
aims of today, he will have to atone as if it were his own special
sin; and he may marvel at the concealed wisdom of his nature that,
after every such attempt, at once draws him back to himself by
means of sickness and bad accidents.

The most difficult and highest form of man will succeed most
rarely: thus the history of philosophy reveals a superabundance of
failures, of accidents, and an extremely slow advance; whole mil­

continuity is broken again and again. It is an appalling history—
the history of the highest man, the sage.—

What is most harmed is precisely the memory of the great,
for the semi-failures and the failures misunderstand them and
vanquish them by means of “successes,” Every time “an influence”
shows itself, a mob crowds upon the scene; the chatter of the
petty and the poor in spirit is a terrible torment for the ears of
those who remember with a shudder that the destiny of humanity
depends upon the attainment of its highest type.
From my childhood I have pondered the cpnditions for the
existence of the sage, and I will not conceal my joyous conviction
that he is again becoming possible in Europe— perhaps only for
a short time.
988 (1885)
We new philosophers, however, not only do we start by
describing the actual order of rank and differences in the value
of men, we also desire precisely the opposite of an assimilation,
an equalization:63 we teach estrangement in every sense, we open
up gulfs such as have never existed before, we desire that man
should become more evil than he has ever been before. In the
meantime, we are still strangers to and from one another. We
have many reasons to be hermits and to put on masks— we shall
therefore be poor at looking for those like us. We shall live alone
and probably suffer the torments of all seven solitudes. But if we
should come across one another, one may wager that we mistake
or mutually deceive one another.

I forgot to say that such philosophers are cheerful and that
they like to sit in the abyss below a perfectly clear sky: they need
different means from other men for enduring life; for they suffer
differently (namely, as much from the profundity of their con­

It is a comfort to me to know that above the steam and
filth of human lowlands there is a higher, brighter humanity, very
small in number (for everything outstanding is by its nature ra re ):
one belongs to it, not because one is more talented or more virtuous
or more heroic or more loving than the men below, but—because
one is colder, brighter, more far-seeing, more solitary; because
one endures, prefers, demands solitude as happiness, as privilege,
indeed as a condition of existence; because one lives among
clouds and lightning as among one’s own kind, but equally
among rays of sunlight, drops of dew, fiakes of snow, and every­
thing that necessarily comes from the heights and, when it moves,
moves eternally only in the direction from above to below.
Aspirations toward the heights are not ours.— Heroes, martyrs,
geniuses and enthusiasts are not still, patient, subtle, cold, slow

How do men attain great strength and a great task? AU the
virtues and efficiency of body and soul are acquired laboriously
and little by little, through much industry, self-constraint, limi­

labors, the same renunciations; but there are men who are the heirs
and masters of this slowly-acquired manifold treasure of virtue and
efficiency—because, through fortunate and reasonable marriages,
and also through fortunate accidents, the acquired arid stored-up
energies of many generations have not been squandered and dis­

there appears a man, a monster of energy, who demands a monster

To him that has turned out well, who does my heart good,
carved from wood that is hard, gentle, and fragrant— in whom even
the nose takes pleasure—this book is dedicated.
He enjoys the taste of what is wholesome for him;
his pleasure in anything ceases when the bounds of the whole­
some are crossed;
he divines the remedies for partial injuries; he has illnesses
as great stimulants of his life;
he knows how to exploit ill chances;
he grows stronger through the accidents that threaten to
destroy him;
he instinctively gathers from all that he sees, hears, experi­
ences, what advances his main concern— he follows a principle
of selection— he allows much to fall through;
he reacts with the slowness bred by a long caution and a
deliberate pride—he tests a stimulus for its origin and its intentions,
he does not submit;
he is always in his own company, whether he deals with
books, men, or landscapes;
he honors by choosing, by admitting, by trusting.

Around 1876 I was terrified to see all I had desired hitherto
compromised, as I grasped which way Wagner was going now;

identity of needs, by gratitude, by his irreplaceability and the
absolute privation I saw before me.
At the same time I seemed to myself irrevocably incarcerated
in my philology and teaching—in an accident and makeshift of

my life: I no longer knew how to extricate myself, and was weary,
spent, used up.
At the same time I grasped that my instinct went into the oppo­
site direction from Schopenhauer’s: toward a justification of life,
even at its most terrible, ambiguous, and mendacious; for this I had
the formula "Dionysian ”
Against the theory that an “in-itself of things” must neces­
sarily be good, blessed, true, and one, Schopenhauer’s interpre­
tation of the “in-itself” as will was an essential step; but he did
not understand how to deify this will: he remained entangled in
the moral-Christian ideal. Schopenhauer was still so much subject
to the dominion of Christian values that, as soon as the thing-initself was no longer “God” for him, he had to see it as bad,
stupid, and absolutely reprehensible. He failed to grasp that there
can be an infinite variety of ways of being different, even of being
god,98

Moral values have hitherto been the highest values: would
anybody call this in question?— If we remove these values from

over many, so they are pressed into service when they are needed?
—whether one is a problem or a solution?— whether perfect with a

or avoids it? whether one is imperfect through being “too early”
or “too late”? whether by nature one says Yes or No or is a
peacock’s tail of many colors? whether one is sufficiently proud
not to be ashamed even of one’s vanity? whether one is still capable
of a bite of conscience? (— this species is becoming rare: formerly
the conscience had too much to chew: now it seems to have lost
its teeth)?71 whether one is still capable of a “duty”? (— there are
those who would lose their whole joy in living if their duty were
taken from them—especially the womanly, the bom subjects.)

It is only a question of strength: to have all the morbid
traits of the century, but to balance them through a superabundant,
recuperative strength. The strong man.
1015 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
On the strength of the nineteenth century.— We are more
medieval than the eighteenth century; not merely more curious
about or easily stimulated by the strange and rare. We have revolted
against the Revolution— We have emancipated ourselves from
fear of reason, the ghost that haunted the eighteenth century: we
again dare to be absurd, childish, lyrical—in one word: “we are
musicians.” We are as little afraid of the ridiculous as of the
absurd. The devil finds that the tolerance of God works in his
favor: even more, he is interesting as one who has been mis­
understood and slandered from of old—we rescue the honor of
the devil.
We no longer separate the great from the terrible. We
include together the good things, in their complexity, and the
worst things: we have overcome the absurd “desirability” of
former days (which desired increase of the good without increase
of the evil). Cowardice before the ideal of the Renaissance has
receded— we even dare to aspire to its mores. Intolerance toward
the priest and the church has come to an end at the same time;
“it is immoral to believe in God”— but precisely this seems
to us the best justification of such faith.
We have granted all these things their rights. We are not
afraid of the reverse side of “good things” (— we seek them: we
are brave and curious enough); e.g., of Hellenism, of morality,
of reason, of good taste (we compute the losses one sustains
with all such precious things: one almost makes oneself poor
with such a precious thing— ), Just as little do we conceal from
ourselves the reverse side of bad things.

What does us honor.— If anything does us honor, it is this:

things that have at all times been despised and left aside—on the
other hand, we let “beautiful feelings” go cheap.
Is there a more dangerous aberration than contempt for the
body? As if it did not condemn all spirituality to become sickly
— to the vapeurs of “idealism” !
Whatever Christians and idealists have devised has neither
rhyme nor reason: we are more radical. We have discovered
the “smallest world” as that which is decisive everywhere.72
The way our streets are paved, good air in our room,73 food
— we grasp their value; we have taken all the necessities of exist­
ence seriously and despise all “beautiful-soulism” as a kind of
“levity and frivolity.”— What was formerly most despised has
been brought to the front.
1017 (Spring-Fall 1887)
In place of the “natural man” of Rousseau, the nineteenth
century has discovered a truer image of “man”— it has had the
courage to do so.— On the whole, the Christian concept “man”
has thus been reinstated. What one has not had the courage for is
to call this “man in himself” good and to see in him the guarantee
of the future. Neither has one dared to grasp that an increase
in the terribleness of man is an accompaniment of every increase
in culture; in this, one is still subject to the Christian ideal and
takes its side against paganism, also against the Renaissance
concept of virtu. But the key to culture is not to be found in this
way: and in praxi one retains the falsification of history in favor of
the “good man” (as if he alone constituted the progress of man)
and the socialist ideal (i.e., the residue of Christianity and of
Rousseau in the de-Christianized world).
The struggle against the eighteenth century: its supreme over­
coming by Goethe and Napoleon. Schopenhauer, too, struggles
against it; but he involutarily steps back into the seventeenth
century—he is a modern Pascal, with Pascalian value judgments
without Christianity. Schopenhauer was not strong enough for

On the pessimism of strength.— In the inner psychic economy
of the primitive man, fear of evil predominates. What is evil?
Three things: chance, the uncertain, the sudden. How does primi­
tive man fight against evil?— He conceives it as reason, as power,
even as a person. In this way he establishes the possibility of
entering into a kind of treaty with it and in general to exercise
influence over it in advance— to forestall it.
— Another expedient is to assert that its malice and harm­
fulness is merely appearance: one interprets the consequences of
chance, of the uncertain and sudden as well meant, as meaningful,

follows: “1018: 86-87.” As usual, it bases its information on 1911, where
we are told on p. 494 that 1018 comes from “N XLII, 77”—and on p. 480,

—A third means: one interprets the bad above all as “de­
served” : one justifies evil as punishment.
— In summa one submits to it: the whole religio-moral inter­
pretation is only a form of submission to evil.— The faith that a
good meaning lies in evil means to abandon the struggle against it.
Now the whole history of culture represents a diminution of
this fear of chance, the uncertain, the sudden. For culture means
learning to calculate, to think causally, to forestall, to believe in
necessity. With the increase of culture, man can do without that
primitive form of submission to ills (called religion or morality),
that “justification of evil.” Now he makes war on “ills”— he
abolishes them. Indeed, a state is possible in which the sense of
security and belief in law and calculability enter consciousness
in the form of satiety and disgust— while the delight in chance,
the uncertain and sudden becomes titillating.
Let us dwell a moment on this symptom of highest culture—
I call it the pessimism of strength. Man no longer needs a “justifi­
cation of ills”; “justification” is precisely what he abhors: he
enjoys ills pur, cru; he finds senseless ills the most interesting. If
he formerly had need of a god, he now takes delight in a world
disorder without God, a world of chance, to whose essence belong
the terrible, the ambiguous, the seductive.
In such a state it is precisely the good that needs “justifying,”
i.e., it must be founded in evil and danger or involve some great
stupidity: then it still pleases. Animality no longer arouses horror;
esprit and happy exuberance70 in favor of the animal in man
is in such ages the most triumphant form of spirituality. Man is
now strong enough to be ashamed of any faith in God: he may
again play the advocatus diabolL If he in praxi advocates the
preservation of virtue, he does it for reasons that recognize in
virtue a subtlety, a cunning, a form of lust for gain and power.
This pessimism of strength also ends in a theodicy, i.e., in an
absolute affirmation of the world— but for the very reasons that
formerly led one to deny it— and in this fashion to a conception of
this world as the actually-achieved highest possible ideal.

the pessimism of sensibility (excessive irritability with a
preponderance of unpleasurable feelings);
the pessimism of “unfree will” (in other words: a lack of
strength in resisting stimuli);
the pessimism of doubt (a distaste for everything firm, for
all grasping and touching).
The psychological states proper to these can all be observed
in the madhouse, even if in a somewhat exaggerated form. Also
“nihilism” (the penetrating feeling of—“nothingness” ).
But where does the moral pessimism of Pascal belong? the
metaphysical pessimism of the Vedanta philosophy? the social
pessimism of the anarchists (or of Shelley)? the pessimism of
sympathy (like that of Leo Tolstoy, Alfred de Vigny)?
Are all these not likewise phenomena of decay and sickness?—
To give excessive weight to moral values or to fictions of the
“beyond” or to social distress or to suffering in general: every
such exaggeration of a narrow viewpoint is in itself already a sign
of sickness. Likewise the preponderance of No over Yes!
What must not be confused with all this: pleasure in saying
No and doing No out of a tremendous strength and tension
derived from saying Yes—peculiar to all rich and powerful men
and ages. A luxury, as it were; also a form of bravery that opposes
the terrible; a sympathetic feeling for the terrible and questionable
because one is, among other things, terrible and questionable:
the Dionysian in will, spirit, taste.

against his “nature,” his “good man,” his belief in the dominion
of feeling— against the softening, weakening, moralization of man:
an ideal bom of hatred for aristocratic culture; in praxi, the
dominion of the feelings of unbridled ressentiment, devised as
a banner for the struggle (— the morality of guilt feelings of the
Christian, the morality of ressentiment a posture of the mob).
4. My struggle against romanticism, in which Christian ideals
and the ideals of Rousseau unite, but compounded with a nostalgia
for the old days of priestly-aristocratic culture, for virtu, for the
“strong human being”— something extremely hybrid; a false and
impersonated strong humanity that values extreme states in general
and sees in them a symptom of strength (“cult of passion” ; an
imitation of the most expressive forms, furore espressivo, not
out of plenitude but out of a lack).— (W hat in the nineteenth

From the pressure of plenitude, from the tension of forces
that continually increase in us and do not yet know how to discharge
themselves, there arises a condition like that preceding a storm:
the nature we constitute becomes dark. This, too, is “pessimism”—
A doctrine that puts an end to such a condition by command­
ing something or other— a revaluation of values by virtue of which
the accumulated forces are shown a way, a whither, so they explode
into lightning flashes and deeds— certainly does not need to be
a doctrine of happiness: by releasing force that had been com­
pressed and dammed to the point of torment it brings happiness.

it is with him that the realm of evil is most comprehensive. The
basest man will see the realm of evil (i.e., of that which is for­
bidden and hostile to him) everywhere.

Not “happiness follows virtue”— but the more powerful man
first designates his happy state as virtue.
Evil actions belong to the powerful and virtuous: bad, base
ones to the subjected.
" At this point the MS has the phrase: “(the realm of evil becomes ever
smaller—) ” There seems to be no good reason for omitting this, but though
the words are printed in the notes of 1911, p. 514, all editions, including
Schlechta’s, leave them out.

The most powerful man, the creator, would have to be the
most evil, in as much as he carries his ideal against the ideals of
other men and remakes them in his own image. Evil here means:
hard, painful, enforced.
Such men as Napoleon must come again and again and con­
firm the belief in the autocracy of the individual: but he himself
was corrupted by the means he had to employ and lost noblesse
of character. If he had had to prevail among a different kind of
man he could have employed other means; and it would thus not
seem to be a necessity for a Caesar to become bad,
1027 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Man is beast and superbeast;82 the higher man is inhuman and
superhuman: these belong together. With every increase of great­
ness and height in man, there is also an increase in depth and
terribleness: one ought not to desire the one without the other—
or rather: the more radically one desires the one, the more
radically one achieves precisely the other.
1028 (Spring-Fall 1887)
Terribleness is part of greatness: let us not deceive ourselves.

I have presented such terrible images to knowledge that any
“Epicurean delight” is out of the question. Only Dionysian joy is
sufficient: / have been the first to discover the tragic.85 The Greeks,
thanks to their moralistic superficiality, misunderstood it. Even
**Untier und Vbertier. Cf. the note to section 877 above, for a passage
in which Nictzsche calls Napoleon “this synthesis of the inhuman and
superhuman"— Unmensch und Ubermensch, Ubertier is strictly analagous to
Vbermensch, overman, and is a coinage. Under is an established German
word and means monster, beast.
“ This may sound so mad that few if any readers will understand
what Nietzsche means. Plato’s and Aristotle’s approaches to tragedy were
moralistic, and they failed to understand tragedy; so did Schopenhauer and,
in various ways, others who wrote about it. Nietzsche’s suggestion, first
offered in The Birth of Tragedy, at the very end of section 7, is that tragedy
is born of an insight into the utter terror and absurdity of existence and
of a despair so profound that only the sublime beauty of the great tragedies
can engender a “Dionysian joy . . . sufficient1’ to save man.

resignation is not a lesson of tragedy, but a misunderstanding of
it! Yearning for nothingness is a denial of tragic wisdom, its
opposite!

A full and powerful soul not only copes with painful, even
terrible losses, deprivations, robberies, insults; it emerges from
such hells with a greater fullness and powerfulness; and, most
essential of all, with a new increase in the blissfulness of love. I
believe that he who has divined something of the most basic
conditions for this growth in love will understand what Dante
meant when he wrote over the gate of his Inferno: “I, too, was
created by eternal love.”84

To explore the whole sphere of the modem soul, to have sat
in its every nook—my ambition, my torture, and my happiness.

The first question is by no means whether we are content
with ourselves, but whether we are content with anything at all.86
If we affirm one single moment, we thus affirm not only ourselves
but all existence.87 For nothing is self-sufficient, neither in us our­
selves nor in things; and if our soul has trembled with happiness
and sounded like a harp string just once, all eternity was needed
“ It is doubtful that this section really helps us to “understand what
Dante meant,” or that it is very well considered; after all, it is a mere note
and was not embodied in a book. But the point seems to be that there is
an ultimate connection between the most terrible suffering and the best love.

The affirmative affects: pride, joy, health, love of the sexes,
enmity and war, reverence, beautiful gestures and manners,88
strong will, the discipline of high spirituality, will to power,
gratitude toward earth and life— everything that is rich and
desires to bestow and that replenishes and gilds and immortalizes

We few or many who again dare to live in a dismoralized world,
we pagans in faith: we are probably also the first to grasp what
a pagan faith is:— to have to imagine higher creatures than man,
but beyond good and evil; to have to consider all being higher
as also being immoral. We believe in Olympus— and not in the
“Crucified.”
1035 (Spring-Fall 1887; rev. Spring-Fall 1888)
Latter-day man has employed his power of idealization in
regard to a god chiefly to make the god more and more moral.
What does that signify?—Nothing good, a diminution of the
strength of man.
For in itself the opposite would be possible; and there are
indications of this. God conceived as an emancipation from
morality, taking into himself the whole fullness of life’s antitheses
and, in a divine torment, redeeming and justifying them: God
as the beyond and above of the wretched loafers* morality of
“good and evil.”

Let us remove supreme goodness from the concept of God:
it is unworthy of a god. Let us also remove supreme wisdom:
it is the vanity of philosophers that is to be blamed for this mad
notion of God as a monster of wisdom: he had to be as like them

So many strange things have passed before me in those time­
less moments that fall into one’s life as if from the moon, when
one no longer has any idea how old one is or how young one will

There are some one cannot imagine without a certain halcyon and

tickled by some sunray of happiness; exuberant and encouraged
even by misery—for misery preserves the happy man; fixing a

is the ideal of a heavy, hundredweight spirit— a spirit of gravity.

humanity left not to die of thirst in the drought.
1041 (1888)
M y new path to a " Y e s — Philosophy, as I have hitherto
understood and lived it, is a voluntary quest for even the most
detested and notorious03 sides of existence. From the long ex­
perience I gained from such a wandering through ice and wilder­
ness, I learned to view differently all that had hitherto philoso­
phized: the hidden history of philosophy, the psychology of its
great names, came to light for me. “How much truth can a spirit
endure, how much truth does a spirit dare?”— this became for
me the real standard of value,04 Error is cowardice— every achieve­
ment of knowledge is a consequence of courage, of severity toward
oneself, of cleanliness toward oneself— Such an experimental
philosophy as I live anticipates experimentally even the possibilities
of the most fundamental nihilism; but this does not mean that
it must halt at a negation, a No, a will to negation. It wants rather
to cross over to the opposite of this— to a Dionysian affirmation of
the world as it is, without subtraction, exception, or selection— it
wants the eternal circulation:— the same things, the same logic
and illogic of entanglements. The highest state a philosopher can
attain: to stand in a Dionysian relationship to existence— my for­
mula for this is amor fati,95
It is part of this state to perceive not merely the necessity
of those sides of existence hitherto denied, but their desirability;
and not their desirability merely in relation to the sides hitherto
affirmed (perhaps as their complement or precondition), but for
“ The reading of these two words “detested” and “notorious” is un­
certain.

their own sake, as the more powerful, more fruitful, tru er sides of
existence, in which its will finds clearer expression.
It is also part of this state to depreciate that side of existence
which alone has been affirmed hitherto; to perceive the origin of
this valuation and how little a Dionysian value standard for
existence is obliged to it: I pulled up and perceived what it really
was that here affirmed (on one hand, the instinct of the suffering;
on the other the instinct of the herd; and thirdly, the instinct of the
majority against the exceptions— ).
Thus I guessed to what extent a stronger type of man would
necessarily have to conceive the elevation and enhancement of
man as taking place in another direction: higher beings, beyond
good and evil, beyond those values which cannot deny their origin
in the sphere of suffering, the herd, and the majority—I sought in
history the beginnings of this construction of reverse ideals (the
concepts “pagan,” “classical,” “noble” newly discovered and
expounded— ).

hearts1’— cannot possibly imagine and ought not to imagine:
they are sensualists in the best faith, because they accord the
senses a more fundamental value than to that fine sieve, that
thinning and reducing machine, or whatever we may call what
in the language of the people is named “spirit.” The strength and
power of the senses— this is the essential thing in a well-consti­
tuted and complete man: the splendid “animal” must be given
first— what could any “humanization” matter otherwise!

have worked so that it appears as it does (durable and changing
slowly) , we want to go on building— and not criticize it away
as false!
3. Our valuations are a part of this building; they em­
phasize and underline. Of what significance is it if entire religions
say: “all is bad and false and evil”! This condemnation of the
entire process can only be a judgment of the ill-constituted!
4. To be sure, the ill-constituted can be the greatest sufferers
and the most subtle? The contented could be of little value?
5. One must understand the artistic basic phenomenon that
is called “life”— the building spirit that builds under the most
unfavorable conditions: in the slowest manner------ A demonstra­

serves itself.

Dionysus: sensuality and cruelty. Transitoriness could be

1050 (March-June 1888)
The word "Dionysian” means: an urge to unity, a reaching
out beyond personality, the everyday, society, reality, across the
abyss of transitoriness: a passionate-painful overflowing into
darker, fuller, more floating states; an ecstatic affirmation of the
total character of life as that which remains the same, just as
powerful, just as blissful, through all change; the great pantheistic
sharing of joy and sorrow that sanctifies and calls good even
the most terrible and questionable qualities of life; the eternal will
to procreation, to fruitfulness, to recurrence; the feeling of the
necessary unity of creation and destruction.
The world "Apollinian” means: the urge to perfect selfsufficiency, to the typical “individual,” to all that simplifies, disstinguishes, makes strong, clear, unambiguous, typical: freedom
under the law.
The further development of art is as necessarily tied to the
antagonism between these two natural artistic powers as the
further development of man is to that between the sexes. Plenitude
of power and moderation, the highest form of self-affirmation in
a cool, noble, severe beauty: the Apollinianism of the Hellenic will.
This antithesis of the Dionysian and the Apollinian within the
Greek soul is one of the great riddles to which I felt myself
drawn when considering the nature of the Greeks. Fundamentally
I was concerned with nothing except to guess why precisely
Greek Apollinianism had to grow out of a Dionysian subsoil;

540

why the Dionysian Greek needed to become Apollinian; that is,
to break his will to the terrible, multifarious, uncertain, frightful,
upon a will to measure, to simplicity, to submission to rule and
concept. The immoderate, disorderly Asiatic lies at his roots:
the bravery of the Greek consists in his struggle with his Asiaticism;
beauty is not given to him, as little as is logic or the naturalness
of customs— it is conquered, willed, won by struggle— it is his
victory,96
1051 (1885)
The highest and most illustrious human joys, in which exist­
ence celebrates its own transfiguration, come, as is reasonable,
only to the rarest and best-constituted men; and even to these
only when they themselves and their ancestors have lived long,
preparatory lives directed to this goal, and not even in the
knowledge of this goal Then an overflowing wealth of the most
multifarious forces and the most dextrous power of “free willing”
and lordly command dwell amicably together in one man; the
spirit is then as much at home in the senses as the senses are
at home in the spirit; and whatever takes place in the spirit must
enkindle a subtle extraordinary happiness and play in the senses.
And also the other way around! Consider this reverse process in
the case of Hafiz; even Goethe, however much more faintly,
gives us an idea of this occurrence. It is probable that with such
perfect and well-constituted men the most sensual functions are
finally transfigured by a symbol-intoxication of the highest spiri­
tuality: they experience a kind of deification of the body in them­
selves and are as distant as possible from the ascetic philosophy of
the proposition “God is a spirit”— and this shows clearly that
MNietzsche first introduced the contrast o f the Dionysian and A pollinian
in The Birth of Tragedy, his first book. In his later works there are relatively
few references to the Apollinian, and the D ionysian comes to be contrasted
m ore and m ore with the C hristian, as in section 1,052 below. The spirit o f
these two juxtapositions is not at all the sam e, and the conception of the
D ionysian changes accordingly. In the fo rm er contrast, neither elem ent is
given preference: note, e.g., the penultim ate paragraph o f section 1,050. In
the later contrast, Nietzsche uses Dionysus as the sym bol o f his own w orld
view.
These reflections on The Birth of Tragedy— apparently in connection
with the section on that book in Ecce Homo— help o u r understanding o f
N ietzsche’s first work.

the ascetic is the “ill-constituted man,” who calls good only a
something-in-itself, and indeed a something that judges and con­
demns— and also calls it “God.”
From that height of joy where man feels himself to be
altogether a deified form and a self-justification of nature, down
to the joy of healthy peasants and healthy half-human animals,
this whole, long, tremendous light and color scale of happiness,
the Greeks, not without the grateful shudder of him who is
initiated into a mystery, not without much caution and pious
silence, called by the divine name: Dionysus.— What do any
latter-day men, the children of a fragmentary, multifarious, sick,
strange age, know of the range of Greek happiness; what could
they know of it! Whence would the slaves of “modem ideas”
derive a right to Dionysian festivals!
When the Greek body and the Greek soul “bloomed,” and
not in conditions of morbid exaltation and madness, there arose
that mysterious symbol of the highest world-affirmation and trans­
figuration of existence that has yet been attained on earth. Here
we have a standard by which everything that has grown up since
is found too short, too poor, too narrow. One only needs to
pronounce the word “Dionysus” in the presence of the best latterday names and things, in the presence of Goethe perhaps, or
Beethoven, or Shakespeare, or Raphael— at once we feel that
our best things and moments have been judged. Dionysus is a
judge!— Have I been understood?
There can be no doubt that the Greeks sought to interpret
the ultimate mysteries “of the destiny of the soul” and everything
they knew concerning education and purification, above all con­
cerning the immovable order of rank and inequality of value
between man and man, on the basis of their Dionysian experi­
ences: here is the great depth, the great silence, in all matters
Greek— one does not know the Greeks as long as this hidden
subterranean entrance lies blocked. Importunate scholar’s eyes
will never see anything in these things, however much scholarship
still has to be employed in this excavation. Even the noble zeal of
such friends of antiquity as Goethe and Winckelmann here has
something unpermitted, even immodest about it.

through something supra-Christian, and not merely to put it

Dionysian; to rediscover the South in one and to spread out
above one a bright, glittering, mysterious southern sky; to re­
conquer southern health and hidden powerfulness of soul; step
by step to become more comprehensive, more supranational, more
European, more Near Eastern, finally more Greek— for the Greek
was the first great union and synthesis of everything Near Eastern,
and on that account the inception of the European soul, the dis­

Must its highest representative not be an apology for and deifica­
tion of life? The type of a well-constituted and ecstatically over­
flowing spirit! The type of a spirit09 that takes into itself and
redeems the contradictions and questionable aspects of existence!
It is here I set the Dionysus of the Greeks: the religious
affirmation of life, life whole and not denied or in part; (typical

thesis. It is not a difference in regard to their martyrdom—it is a
difference in the meaning of it. Life itself, its eternal fruitfulness
and recurrence, creates torment, destruction, the will to annihila­
tion. In the other case, suffering—the “Crucified as the innocent
one”— counts as an objection to this life, as a formula for its
condemnation.— One will see that the problem is that of the
meaning of suffering: whether a Christian meaning or a tragic
meaning. In the former case, it is supposed to be the path to a
holy existence; in the latter case, being is counted as holy enough
to justify even a monstrous amount of suffering. The tragic man
affirms even the harshest suffering: he is sufficiently strong, rich,
and capable of deifying to do so. The Christian denies even the
happiest lot on earth: he is sufficiently weak, poor, disinherited
to suffer from life in whatever form he meets it. The god on the
cross is a curse on101 life, a signpost to seek redemption from
life; Dionysus cut to pieces is a promise of life: it will be eternally
reborn and return again from destruction.102

In the MS the definite article, needed in G erm an before “life,” is

In sum : this section is in m any ways typical o f the whole book. It
was written in extreme haste, and it would be an understatem ent to say th at
it was not polished for publication; but for all that it is rem arkable— as a
docum ent that aids ou r understanding of Nietzsche, as a prose passage, and
for the ideas it expresses.

Prevention of reduction to mediocrity. Rather destruction!

A pessimistic teaching and way of thinking, an ecstatic
nihilism, can under certain conditions be indispensable precisely
to the philosopher— as a mighty pressure and hammer with which
he breaks and removes degenerate and decaying races to make
way for a new order of life, or to implant into that which is
degenerate and desires to die a longing for the end.

The two greatest philosophical points of view (devised by
Germans):
a) that of becoming, of development
b) that according to the value of existence (but the
wretched form of German pessimism must first be
overcome!)—both brought together my me in a de­
cisive way.

ceived as a tool, as the father of pleasure; there is no cumulative
consciousness of displeasure); the enjoyment of all kinds of un­
certainty, experimentalism, as a counterweight to this extreme
fatalism; abolition of the concept of necessity; abolition of the
“will”; abolition of “knowledge-in-itself.”
Greatest elevation of the consciousness of strength in man,
as he creates the overman.
1061 ( 1887-1888)
The two most extreme modes of thought— the mechanistic
and the Platonic—are reconciled in the eternal recurrence: both
as ideals.
1062 (1885)
If the world had a goal, it must have been reached. If there
were for it some unintended final state, this also must have been
reached. If it were in any way capable of a pausing and becoming
fixed, of “being,” if in the whole course of its becoming it possessed
even for a moment this capability of “being,” then all becoming
would long since have come to an end, along with all thinking,
all “spirit.” The fact of “spirit” as a form of becoming proves
that the world has no goal, no final state, and is incapable of
being.
The old habit, however, of associating a goal with every
event and a guiding, creative God with the world, is so power­
ful that it requires an effort for a thinker not to fall into thinking
of the very aimlessness of the world as intended. This notion—
that the world intentionally avoids a goal and even knows artifices
for keeping itself from entering into a circular course— must occur
to all those who would like to force on the world the ability for
eternal novelty, i.e., on a finite, definite, unchangeable force of
constant size, such as the world is, the miraculous power of infinite
novelty in its forms and states. The world, even if it is no longer
a god, is still supposed to be capable of the divine power of
creation, the power of infinite transformations; it is supposed to
consciously prevent itself from returning to any of its old forms;
it is supposed to possess not only the intention but the means of
avoiding any repetition; to that end, it is supposed to control every
one of its movements at every moment so as to escape goals, final

book f o u r :

states, repetitions— and whatever else may follow from such an
unforgiveably insane way of thinking and desiring. It is still the
old religious way of thinking and desiring, a kind of longing to
believe that in some way the world is after all like the old beloved,
infinite, boundlessly creative God—that in some way “the old
God still lives”— that longing of Spinoza which was expressed in the
words “deus sive natura”m (he even felt “natura sive deus”).
What, then, is the law and belief with which the decisive
change, the recently attained preponderance of the scientific spirit
over the religious, God-inventing spirit, is most clearly formulated?
Is it not: the world, as force, may not be thought of as unlimited,
for it cannot be so thought of; we forbid ourselves the concept of
an infinite force as incompatible with the concept “force,” Thus
—the world also lacks the capacity for eternal novelty.
1063 ( 1886-1887)
The law of the conservation of energy demands eternal recur­
rence.
1064 (1885)
That a state of equilibrium is never reached proves that it
is not possible. But in an indefinite space it would have to have
been reached. Likewise in a spherical space. The shape of space
must be the cause of eternal movement, and ultimately of all
“imperfection.”
That “force” and “rest,” “remaining the same,” contradict
one another. The measure of force (as magnitude) as fixed, but
its essence in flux.106
“Timelessness” to be rejected. At any precise moment of a
force, the absolute conditionality of a new distribution of all its
forces is given: it cannot stand still. “Change” belongs to the
essence, therefore also temporality: with this, however, the neces­
sity of change has only been posited once more conceptually.

all things so as not to take them too seriously and to live at peace
among them. To me, on the contrary, everything seems far too
valuable to be so fleeting: I seek an eternity for everything: ought
one to pour the most precious salves and wines into the sea?—
My consolation is that everything that has been is eternal: the
sea will cast it up again,

The new w o r ld - c o n c e p tio n The world exists; it is not
something that becomes, not something that passes away. Or
rather: it becomes, it passes away, but it has never begun to
become and never ceased from passing away— it maintains itself
in both.— It lives on itself: its excrements are its food.
We need not worry for a moment about the hypothesis of a
created world. The concept “create” is today completely indefin­
able,107 unrealizable; merely a word, a rudimentary survival from
the ages of superstition; one can explain nothing with a mere
word. The last attempt to conceive a world that had a beginning
has lately been made several times with the aid of logical pro­
cedures— generally, as one may divine, with an ulterior theological
motive.
Lately one has sought several times to find a contradiction in
the concept “temporal infinity of the world in the past” (regressus
in infinitum): one has even found it, although at the cost of
confusing the head with the tail. Nothing can prevent me from
reckoning backward from this moment and saying “I shall never
reach the end”; just as I can reckon forward from the same
moment into the infinite. Only if I made the mistake— I shall
guard against it—of equating this correct concept of a regressus
in infinitum with an utterly unrealizable concept of a finite progressus up to this present, only if I suppose that the direction (forward
or backward) is logically a matter of indifference, would I take
the head— this moment— for the tail: I shall leave that to you,
my dear Herr Diihring!—
I have come across this idea in earlier thinkers: every time
it was determined by other ulterior considerations (— mostly
theological, in favor of the creator spiritus). If the world could in
any way become rigid, dry, dead, nothing, or if it could reach a

state of equilibrium, or if it had any kind of goal that involved
duration, immutability, the once-and-for-all (in short, speaking
metaphysically: if becoming could resolve itself into being or
into nothingness), then this state must have been reached. But it
has not been reached: from which it follows—
This is the sole certainty we have in our hands to serve as a
corrective to a great host of world hypotheses possible in themseves. If, e.g., the mechanistic theory cannot avoid the conse­
quence, drawn for it by William Thomson,108 of leading to a final
state, then the mechanistic theory stands refuted.
If the world may be thought of as a certain definite quantity
of force and as a certain definite number of centers of force— and
every other representation remains indefinite and therefore useless
— it follows that, in the great dice game of existence, it must pass
through a calculable number of combinations. In infinite time,
every possible combination would at some time or another be
realized; more: it would be realized an infinite number of times.
And since between every combination and its next recurrence all
other possible combinations would have to take place, and each
of these combinations conditions the entire sequence of combina­
tions in the same series, a circular movement of absolutely identical
series is thus demonstrated: the world as a circular movement that
has already repeated itself infinitely often and plays its game
in infinitum.
This conception is not simply a mechanistic conception; for
if it were that, it would not condition an infinite recurrence of
identical cases, but a final state. Because the world has not reached
this, mechanistic theory must be considered an imperfect and
merely provisional hypothesis.

it to you in my mirror? This world: a monster of energy, without
beginning, without end; a firm, iron magnitude of force that does
not grow bigger or smaller, that does not expend itself but only
transforms itself; as a whole, of unalterable size, a household with­
out expenses or losses, but likewise without increase or income;
enclosed by “nothingness” as by a boundary; not something blurry
or wasted, not something endlessly extended, but set in a definite
space as a definite force, and not a space that might be “empty”
here or there, but rather as force throughout, as a play of forces
and waves of forces, at the same time one and many, increasing
here and at the same time decreasing there; a sea of forces flow­
ing and rushing together, eternally changing, eternally flooding
back, with tremendous years of recurrence, with an ebb and a
flood of its forms; out of the simplest forms striving toward the
most complex, out of the stillest, most rigid, coldest forms toward
the hottest, most turbulent, most self-contradictory, and then
again returning home to the simple out of this abundance, out of
the play of contradictions back to the joy of concord, still affirm­
ing itself in this uniformity of its courses and its years, blessing
itself as that which must return eternally, as a becoming that knows
no satiety, no disgust, no weariness: this, my Dionysian world of
the eternally self-creating, the eternally self-destroying, this mystery
world of the twofold voluptuous delight, my “beyond good and
evil,” without goal, unless the joy of the circle is itself a goal;
without will, unless a ring feels good will toward itself— do you
want a name for this world? A solution for all its riddles? A light

besides! And you yourselves are also this will to power— and

Commentary on the

FACSIMILES
In the Bibliography o f m y *Nietzsche (Princeton, N . J., Princeton U ni­
versity Press, 1950), which was om itted in the paperback edition (N ew
Y ork, M eridian Books, 1956), I stated:
“A ny w ork on Nietzsche m ight seem merely provisional, pending
the publication of all hitherto suppressed words and sentences. Such
an inference, however, would be unw arranted. T he principles which
guided G ast and F ra u Forster-N ietzsche in making omissions are
very plain— from their published Nietzsche interpretations, fro m the
explanations w hich accom pany some o f the omissions (W M [Der
Wille zur Macht]) , from the context, and from the nature of those cen­
sored passages which have been published from tim e to tim e; e.g., by
HofmiUer and Podach. Some unkind comm ents on F rau Forster-N ietz­
sche, R ichard W agner, anti-Semitism, the G erm an Reich, and C hristi­
anity were suppressed; but there is no reason w hatever fo r believing
th at the hitherto withheld m aterial includes anything o f significance
that would have corroborated F rau Forster^Nietzsche’s version o f her
brother's thought. It is therefore quite unlikely th at future editions
o f Nietzsche’s works will necesitate any radical revision of an interpre­
tation which does justice to the m aterial so far published” (p. 385).
In spite o f the attention K arl Schlechta’s edition o f Nietzsche’s w orks
received in the popular press, and notw ithstanding uninform ed and mis­
leading reviews of Podach’s last two works in some leading A m erican
philosophical periodicals, nothing th at has been brought to light from
Nietzsche’s m anuscripts from 1950 until 1966 is o f any philosophical
im portance. I have dealt in detail with this m atter in an article o n “N ietz­
sche in the Light o f H is Suppressed M anuscripts,” in Journal of the History
of Philosophy, O ctober 1964 (11*2), pp. 205-225, which will be included
in a forthcom ing third revised edition o f m y Nietzsche. There is no need
fo r covering the sam e ground here. But I present the selections from N ietz­
sche’s notebooks that have become know n as The Will to Power, w ithout
feeling apologetic about not having spent years studying the m anuscripts in
W eimar. Let others do that; let philological cleanliness flourish! B ut I
doubt that the results will be philosophically rewarding. F o r all m y interest
in Nietzsche, I still believe as firmly as ever th at the books he finished are
his legacy, and that his notebooks are o f secondary interest— as I explained
in section I of the second chapter o f m y Nietzsche. F a r from feeling any
keen desire to know everything he ever Jotted down, I feel m ore nearly
like an intruder when I scrutinize a m anuscript page, trying to decipher

some note that was never intended to be read by anyone else, much less
to be published.
To do a decent job on notes that have long been in print is one thing—
many of them are extremely interesting, but the way in which they have
been published so far is open to many objections. I am offering a trans­
lation with notes that are intended to clarify both the nature of this
material and hundreds of particular points. But going out of one’s way to
dredge up a few more personal remarks that have not been published
so far is not a job that appeals to me. Nietzsche’s view of Wagner,
Germans, anti-Semites, and Christians are on record in his books; The
Will to Power contains much similar material, and so do the notes not
incorporated in The Wilt to Power but included in the Grossoktav edition
and the Musarion edition of his works. There is no need to spice this
Volume with a few allegedly sensational revelations, alia tedesca (to use a
phrase from Ecce Homo, second chapter, first section), in the manner
that has become popular in Germany.
Nevertheless, I am including in this volume (preceding the text)
several facsimile pages. In The Will to Power there was some indication
that in a few places something had been omitted, or that a section consisted
of an excerpt from a longer note. In these cases I requested photostats of
the manuscript pages from the Goethe-Schiller Archiv in Weimar, in East
Germany, where the manuscripts that were formerly in the Nietzsche
Archiv are now housed. After some correspondence, Professor Hahn, the
Director, graciously sent me eight photostats, with permission to publish
them—but this permission does not cover reproduction elsewhere.
These are not typical pages, nor pages picked at random: Each was
requested because there was evidence that the previously printed texts
were inadequate. These pages contain some material that has never been
published before, either in German or in English; they also show the
German editors at their arbitrary worst and—perhaps most important—
they give the reader some idea of the appearance of the manuscripts.
Those able to read some German may discover to their surprise how little
they can decipher of these pages, and how difficult it is in places to decide
in what order these notes should be printed. By way of contrast, Nietz­
sche’s letters and finished manuscripts are often quite beautiful and, in
general, not particularly difficult to read.
In keeping with what I have said, I shall not transcribe or translate
these pages in full. Instead I shall offer a detailed but brief analysis of
each page.
The Roman numerals below refer to the reproduced facsimile pages
in the present volume. The alphabetic letters in parentheses do not appear on
the facsimile pages but are given below to facilitate dicussion of lines
within the facsimile pages.

Analysis of Facsimile Pages I-III
The first three pages are consecutive ones (46-48) from a notebook
identified in the archives as W II, 1, Nr. 157. Approximate date: SpringFall, 1887.

a p p e n d ix

553

I: The first seven lines (a) were published as the beginning of section
124 and are translated in the first seven lines of our edition.
The following six lines (b), assigned a different number by Nietzsche
himself have not been published to date.
The last eight lines (c), again set off by a different number by Nietz­
sche himself, constitute section 736, entire.
IT: The first line (“The problem of civilization spirit everything”) was
not published.
A horizontal line across the page clearly divides what follows into two
separate notes, of which the second has a title of its own. Yet Nietzsche
assigned the number 80 to both—the same number he placed over the first
seven lines on the preceding page, which were published as the beginning of
section 124.
The German editors published lines 2-5 (d) as the continuation and
conclusion of section 124 (the final paragraph in the present volume). Lines
6-10 (e), which comprise a separate paragraph in Nietzsche’s MS, were
omitted in the editions of 1906 and 1911, and in all subsequent editions.
However this omission is not indicated in the editorial apparatus, 1911,
p. 500. In the first edition of 1901, on the other hand, section 36 contains
everything to which Nietzsche had assigned the number 80; the first seven
lines on the preceding page, followed by all of the material on this page,
excepting only the first line (which Nietzsche apparently did not mean to
include)* and the final sentence of the second paragraph, of which it was
duly said in the editorial apparatus (p, 531): “A short sentence has been
omitted here,” A translation of the material not included in section 124
will be found in my note on that section.
The material below the horizontal line (f) was published as section
117. In 1911, p. 500, it is duly noted that the editors added five words at
the end of this section (to clarify the meaning); but Schlechta follows the
printed text, as usual, and not the MS.
Ill: The first eight lines (g), set off from what follows by a horizontal
line across the page, were printed as section 883 (1901, section 439)*
The next seven lines (h), not published in the edition of 1901, were
published as section 612; and the immediately following two lines (i),
though set off by another horizontal line and crossed out along with the
last four lines on the page, were also published—as the conclusion of section
612.
The final four lines (j) were printed by Nietzsche himself, as the
beginning of section 24 of “Skirmishes,” in Twilight of the Idols (Portable
Nietzsche, p. 529).
The editorial notes at the end of 1911 offer no comments on either
section 883 or section 612.
A note on Schlechta's handling of this material:
In vol. HI, Schlechta prints some of this material on pp. 531 /, in the
following sequence: (a) and (d) as one note; (c); (f)—deviating from the
MS as noted above; (h) and (i) as one note; and finally (g).
In sum: the way the notes on these three pages have been published
is a mess; but as long as we keep in mind that we are dealing with mere

554

THE

WILL

notes, the arrangement is hardly very important, and even Nietzsche
scholars did not lose much by the "suppression” of (b) and (e). For that
matter, (e) was actually published in 1901, with the exception of one
very dispensable sentence; and all of this material is included in my note on
section 124.
Discovery: (b), published here for the first time, contains one re­
markable aphorism, entitled “On the Genealogy of Christianity —It re­
quires more courage and strength of character to turn back than to go on.
To turn back without [?] cowardice is more difficult than to go on with
[?] cowardice**

Facsimile Pages IV and V
These are consecutive pages (15-16) from a notebook identified in the
archives as W II, 2, Nr. 158. Approximate date: Spring-Fall, 1887.
IV: The first seven lines (k), which form a unit and were assigned
number 279 by Nietzsche, have not been published until now.
The rest of the material (1) on that page, which was assigned number
280 by Nietzsche, was printed as section 172, along with its continuation
on the next page,
V: but a little less than two lines (m ), beginning at the end of line
7 and ending with the second word of line 9, were deleted in print; and
in 1911, p. 502, it is duly noted that “one sentence has been omitted here.”
It is not stated that a few words, added by Nietzsche in the lower righthand corner, were also omitted, perhaps because they could not be de­
ciphered with any assurance. The same comments apply to the correspond­
ing section (119) in the edition of 1901.
(k) and (m) contain a few words that are extremely hard to de­
cipher, but the over-all meaning is clear enough, and these “suppressed”
passages add nothing of interest to what Nietzsche said in The Antichrist,
In the following translations “• . indicates that I' cannot read the writing
with any certainty.

4.22) And one has believed this I ! !

(m ): In the whole history of the spirit there is no more brazen kind
of lie, no more premeditated . . .

Facsimile Pages V I and V II
In the note on section 815 (1911, p. 512) we read: “A second part of this
aphorism, dealing with Richard Wagner, has been omitted.” Schlechta,
who follows the printed versions without indicating any omission, as is
his general practice, lends this section special emphasis by placing it at

555

a p p e n d ix

the end of his edition, leaving the last half of the page on which it ends
blank, and then printing section 256, which comprises only two lines, on
the facing page, centered.
VI is from Mp XVI, 3, Nr. 232, p. 17 (inside). Approximate date:
Summer-Fall 1888. This is no mere note but a carefully written page with
a great many corrections. What is crossed out is made illegible—this pro­
cedure was characteristic of Nietzsche—and the corrections are written very
clearly, though the writing is very small because this material had
to be
squeezed between lines. Because of its smallness, some of it is not easy to
read, especially in facsimile; but all of it can be deciphered with practical
certainty.
The first nine and a half lines were printed as section 815 (section
367 in the edition of 1901); what follows has never been published so far.
A complete translation follows, after a description of facsimile page VII.
VII is identified by the archives as W II, 4, Nr. 160, p. 19, and appears
to be a draft for the second part of VI, with which it agrees literally in
large part.

Translation of the Suppressed Second Part of Section 815
I take the most disagreeable case, the case of Wagner— Wagner, under
the spell of his incredibly pathological sexuality, which was the curse of
his life, knew only too well what an artist forfeits when he loses his free­
dom, his respect for himself. He is condemned to be an actor. His very
art becomes for him a constant attempt to escape, a means of self-oblivion,
of self-narcosis—it eventually changes and determines the character of his
art. Such an “unfree” man requires a hashish world, strange, heavy, envelop­
ing vapors, every kind of exoticism and symbolism of the ideal, merely in
order to be rid for once of his own reality—he requires Wagnerian music.—
A certain catholicity of the ideal above all is almost sufficient proof in the
case of an artist of self-contempt, of “morass” : the case of Baudelaire in
France, the case of Edgar Allan Poe in America, the case of Wagner in
Germany.— Need I still add that Wagner also owes his success to his
sensuality? that his music attracts the lowest instincts to him, to Wagner?
that this holy conceptual vapor of the ideal, of three-eighths Catholicism,
is one more art of seduction? (it permits one to expose oneself to the
magic, ignorant, innocent, Christian— ) Who would risk the word, the
proper word, for the ardeurs of the Tristan music? I put on gloves when
I read the score of Tristan,— Wagnerianism, which keeps spreading, is a
relatively light epidemic of sensuality that “does not realize this”; against
Wagnerian music every caution seems appropriate to me.

Compared with VI, which I have translated, the draft offers nothing of
great interest. In the final version respect (Achtung: the word is emphasized
by Nietzsche and therefore easy to locate, also in my translation) has
been written above another word that has been crossed out: with the help

of the draft, we can tell that the word Nietzsche crossed out was "reverence”
(Ehrfurcht). Indeed, in the draft Nietzsche crossed out Achtung to substi­
tute Ehrfurckt. In the end, he returned to “respect/* There would be no
point here to a more detailed comparison.

Facsimile Page VIII
Identified by the Archive as W II, 7, Nr. 163, p. 136. Approximate date:
1884. Lines 8-12 were printed as section 834 (section 61 in the edition of
1901). In the edition of 1911, but not in that of 1901, we find the comment
(p. 512): ‘Taken from a note about Richard Wagner.”
The last seven lines on this page were evidently put down at a later
time; they comprise a separate note, and they are singularly difficult to
decipher.
A partial translation of the note from which section 834 was ex*
cerpted follows: *\ . ” indicates that I cannot decipher the writing with
any certainty.
TRANSLATION

The impact of Wagner’s art is deep; it is above all heavy, immensely
heavy: why is this? The depth and above all heavy, immensely heavy
impact of Wagner’s art does not really belong to the music of Wagner:
it is Wagner’s general pathos with which his art overpowers; it is the
tremendous persuasive power of his edifice, it is his holding his1 breath,
of his extreme feeling that refuses to let go, it is the frightening length
of his pathos by virtue of which he triumphs and always will triumph.—
Whether with such a pathos one is a “genius”? Or even could be one?—
[At this point, section 834 follows, ending with a dash. Then the note
proceeds:] Another question . .
whether Wagner, precisely because he
had such pathos, is German? is a German? Or does . . »
COMMENT

These are clearly hasty jottings that do not add up to an aphorism. If
anyone wants to know what the later Nietzsche “really” thought of Wagner,
he should begin by reading The Case of Wagner and Nietzsche contra
Wagner, Next, he should look up the passages on Wagner in Nietzsche’s
other late works. Only then should one turn to Nietzsche’s posthumously
published notes and correspondence. Whoever has done all this, is not
likely to feel any anxiety or indignation because he knows that there are
still a few jottings in Nietzsche’s notebooks that have not yet been published.
There are many topics with which Nietzsche never dealt as fully in
his books as he did with Wagner, or with Christianity, or with the Germans:
for example, but by no means only, some philosophical problems. And

Michael Curschmann of the German Department at Princeton University,

the editors had no reason to suppress interesting notes on the theory of
knowledge, or on determinism, or on aesthetics. It is this material that
makes The Will to Power important,
The palpable intent of the philosopher's sister to present The Will
to Power as the systematic work that Nietzsche did not live to finish, was
absurd. But the semi-systematic arrangement that allows us to read, one
after another, a lot of notes that deal with related topics, jotted down
over a period of time, may have the very opposite effect of that intended
by her—at least when the material is presented in the manner attempted
in the present volume. So far from finding any final system, we look into
a vast studio, full of sketches, drafts, abandoned attempts, and unfinished
dreams. And in the end we should be less tempted than ever to mistake a
random quotation for an ultimate position. This is not to say that Nietz­
sche never arrived at any conclusions. He did, but to know what they were
one has to read his books.

INDEX

The German editors’ arrangement of Nietzsche’s notes is far from ideal,
and their table of contents is apt to give the false impression that those
interested in morality, for example, need to turn only to sections 253-405.
Any systematic arrangement of these notes would leave much to be desired;
but the Index should help to give readers a more adequate idea of the con­
tents of this volume.
Most of the work on this Index was done by Andrew Neal Sears in
June, 1966, the month he graduated from Princeton University with high
honors in philosophy. He made use of the work already done by Stephen
R. Watson, and of a name index started some years ago by Stephen Brown,
now M.D. It is a pleasure to express my gratitude to all three of them, and
also to Princeton’s excellent program of undergraduate research assistantships.
I supervised the work and at various stages made hundreds of additions.

Figures refer to sections, not to pages. E refers to
the Editor’s Introduction; EC to the editor’s com­
ments “On the Editions of The Will to Power99; N
to Nietzsche’s Preface; n to the editor’s notes. For
references to Nietzsche’s works see Nietzsche.

F riedrich N ietzsch e was born in 1844 in Rocken (Saxony), G er­
many. He studied classical philology at the universities of Bonn and
Leipzig, and in 1869 was appointed to the chair of classical philology
at the University of Basel, Switzerland. Ill health led him to resign
his professorship ten years later. His works include The Birth of
Tragedy, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Beyond G ood and Evil, On the
Genealogy of Morals, The Case of Wagner, Twilight of the Idols, The
Antichrist, Nietzsche contra Wagner. and Ecce Homo. He died in
1900. The Will to Power, a selection from his notebooks, was published
posthumously.
W alter K aufm ann was bom in Freiburg, Germ any, in 1921, came

to the United States in 1939, and studied at Williams College and
H arvard University. In 1947 he joined the faculty of Princeton U ni­
versity, where he is now Professor of Philosophy. He has held many
visiting professorships, including Fulbright grants at Heidelberg and
Jerusalem. His books include Critique of Religion and Philosophy,
From Shakespeare to Existentialism, The Faith o f a Heretic, Cain and
Other Poems, Hegel, and Tragedy and Philosophy, as well as verse
translations of Goethe’s Faust and Twenty German Poets. The third
edition, revised, of Professor K aufm ann’s critical study Nietzsche:
Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist is available in Vintage Books
(V -436). He has translated all of the books by Nietzsche listed in the
biographical note about Nietzsche above. The following appear in
Vintage Books: Beyond Good and Evil (V -337); The Will to Power
(V -437); and, in one volume, The Birth o f Tragedy and The Case o f
Wagner (V -369); On the Genealogy of Morals and Ecce H om o
(V -401).
R. J, H ollingdale is an English writer, best known for his book
Nietzsche: The Man and His Philosophy.

A

Nietzsche's notebooks, kept by him during his most produc­
tive years, offer a fascinating glimpse into the workshop and
mind of a great thinker, and compare favorably with the
notebooks of Gide and Kafka, Camus and W ittgenstein. The
W ill to Power, compiled from the notebooks, is one of the
most famous books of the past hundred years, b ut few have
studied it. Here, at last, is the first critical edition in any
language.
Down through the Nazi period The W ill to Power was
often mistakenly considered to be Nietzsche's crowning sys­
tem atic labor; since W orld W ar II it has frequently been
denigrated, just as fallaciously, as being not worth reading.
In fact, it represents a stunning selection from Nietzsche’s
notebooks, in a topical arrangem ent th at enables the reader
to find w hat Nietzsche wrote on nihilism, art, morality, re­
ligion, the theory of knowledge, and whatever else inter­
ested him. But no previous edition-even in the original
German—shows which notes Nietzsche utilized subse­
quently in his works, and which sections are not paralleled
in the finished books. Nor has any previous edition furnished
a comm entary or index.
W alter Kaufmann, in collaboration with R. J. Hollingdale,
brings to this volume his unsurpassed skills as a Nietzsche
translator and scholar. Professor Kaufmann has included the
approxim ate date of each note. His running footnote com­
mentary offers the information needed to follow Nietzsche's
train of thought, and indicates, among other things, which
notes w ere eventually superseded by later formulations, and
where all German editions, including the very latest, depart
from the manuscripts. The comprehensive index serves to
guide the reader to the extraordinary riches of this book.

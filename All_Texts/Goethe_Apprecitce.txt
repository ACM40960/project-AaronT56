Translator's Preface
TO THE FIRST EDITION OF MEISTER'S APPRENTICESHIP: WHETHER for it be that the quantity of genius
among ourselves and the French, and the number of works more lasting than brass produced by it, have of late
been so considerable as to make us independent of additional supplies; or that, in our ancient aristocracy of
intellect, we disdain to be assisted by the Germans, whom, by a species of second−sight, we have discovered,
before knowing any thing about them, to be a tumid, dreaming, extravagant, insane race of mortals; certain it is,
that hitherto our literary intercourse with that nation has been very slight and precarious. After a brief period of
not too judicious cordiality, the acquaintance on our part was altogether dropped: nor, in the few years since we
partially resumed it, have our feelings of affection or esteem been materially increased. Our translators are
unfortunate in their selection or execution, or the public is tasteless and absurd in its demands; for, with scarcely
more than one or two exceptions, the best works of Germany have lain neglected, or worse than neglected, and
the Germans are yet utterly unknown to us. Kotzebue still lives in our minds as the representative of a nation that
despises him; Schiller is chiefly known to us by the monstrous production of his boyhood; and Klopstock by a
hacked and mangled image of his "Messias," in which a beautiful poem is distorted into a theosophic rhapsody,
and the brother of Virgil and Racine ranks little higher than the author of Meditations among the Tombs.
But of all these people there is none that has been more unjustly dealt with than Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
For half a century the admiration, we might almost say the idol of his countrymen, to us he is still a stranger. His
name, long echoed and reëchoed through reviews and magazines, has become familiar to our ears: but it is a
sound and nothing more; it excites no definite idea in almost any mind. To such as know him by the faint and
Translator's Preface

garbled version of his "Werther," Goethe figures as a sort of poetic Heraclitus; some woe−begone hypochondriac,
whose eyes are overflowing with perpetual tears, whose long life has been spent in melting into ecstasy at the
sight of waterfalls, and clouds, and the moral sublime, or dissolving into hysterical wailings over hapless
love−stories and the miseries of human life. They are not aware that Goethe smiles at this performance of his
youth; or that the German Werther, with all his faults, is a very different person from his English namesake; that
his Sorrows are in the original recorded in a tone of strength and sarcastic emphasis, of which the other offers no
vestige, and intermingled with touches of powerful thought, glimpses of a philosophy deep as it is bitter, which
our sagacious translator has seen proper wholly to omit. Others again, who have fallen in with Retzsch's
"Outlines" and the extracts from "Faust," consider Goethe as a wild mystic, a dealer in demonology and
osteology, who draws attention by the aid of skeletons and evil spirits, whose excellence it is to be extravagant,
whose chief aim it is to do what no one but himself has tried. The tyro in German may tell us that the charm of
"Faust" is altogether unconnected with its preternatural import; that the work delineates the fate of human
enthusiasm struggling against doubts and errors from within, against scepticism, contempt and selfishness from
without; and that the witchcraft and magic, intended merely as a shadowy frame for so complex and mysterious a
picture of the moral world and the human soul, are introduced for the purpose not so much of being trembled at as
laughed at. The voice of the tyro is not listened to; our indolence takes part with our ignorance; "Faust" continues
to be called a monster; and Goethe is regarded as a man of "some genius," which he has perverted to produce all
manner of misfashioned prodigies; things false, abortive, formless, Gorgons and Hydras and Chimaras dire.
Now, it must no doubt be granted, that so long as our invaluable constitution is preserved in its pristine purity, the
British nation may exist in a state of comparative prosperity with very inadequate ideas of Goethe: but, at the
same time, the present arrangement is an evil in its kind; slight, it is true, and easy to be borne, yet still more easy
to be remedied, and which therefore ought to have been remedied ere now. Minds like Goethe's are the common
property of all nations; and, for many reasons, all should have correct impressions of them.
It is partly with the view of doing something to supply this want, that "Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre" is now
presented to the English public. Written in its Author's forty−fifth year, embracing hints or disquisitions on almost
every leading point in life and literature, it affords us a more distinct view of his matured genius, his manner of
thought and favourite subjects, than any of his other works. Nor is it Goethe alone whom it portrays; the
prevailing taste of Germany is likewise indicated by it. Since the year 1795, when it first appeared at Berlin,
numerous editions of "Meister" have been printed: critics of all ranks, and some of them dissenting widely from
its doctrines, have loaded it with encomiums; its songs and poems are familiar to every German ear; the people
read it, and speak of it, with an admiration approaching in many cases to enthusiasm.
That it will be equally successful in England, I am far indeed from anticipating. Apart from the above
considerations, from the curiosity, intelligent or idle, which it may awaken, the number of admiring, or even
approving judges it will find can scarcely fail of being very limited. To the great mass of readers, who read to
drive away the tedium of mental vacancy, employing the crude phantasmagoria of a modern novel, as their
grandfathers employed tobacco and diluted brandy, "Wilhelm Meister" will appear beyond endurance weary, flat,
stale and unprofitable. Those, in particular, who take delight in "King Cambyses' vein." and open "Meister" with
the thought of "Werther" in their minds, will soon pause in utter dismay, and their paroxysm of dismay will pass
by degrees into unspeakable contempt. Of romance interest there is next to none in "Meister"; the characters are
samples to judge of, rather than persons to love or hate; the incidents are contrived for other objects than moving
or affrighting us; the hero is a milksop, whom, with all his gifts, it takes an effort to avoid despising. The author
himself, far from "doing it in a passion," wears a face of the most still indifference throughout the whole affair;
often it is even wrinkled by a slight sardonic grin. For the friends of the sublime, then, for those who cannot do
without heroical sentiments and "moving accidents by flood and field," there is nothing here that can be of any
service.
Nor among readers of a far higher character can it be expected that many will take the praiseworthy pains of
Germans, reverential of their favourite author, and anxious to hunt out his most elusive charms. Few among us

will disturb themselves about the allegories and typical allusions of the work; will stop to inquire whether it
includes a remote emblem of human culture, or includes no such matter; whether this is a light airy sketch of the
development of man in all his endowments and faculties, gradually proceeding from the first rude exhibitions of
puppets and mountebanks, through the perfection of poetic and dramatic art, up to the unfolding of the principle
of religion, and the greatest of all arts, the art of life,−or is nothing more than a bungled piece of patch−work,
presenting in the shape of a novel much that should have been suppressed entirely, or at least given out by way of
lecture. Whether the characters do or do not represent distinct classes of men, including various stages of human
nature, from the gay material vivacity of Philina to the severe moral grandeur of the Uncle and the splendid
accomplishment of Lothario, will to most of us be of small importance: and the everlasting disquisitions about
plays and players, and politeness and activity, and art and nature, will weary many a mind that knows not and
heeds not whether they are true or false. Yet every man's judgment is, in this free country, a lamp to himself;
whoever is displeased will censure; and many, it is to be feared, will insist on judging "Meister" by the common
rule, and what is worse, condemning it, let Schlegel bawl as loudly as he pleases. "To judge," says he, "of this
book,−new and peculiar as it is, and only to be understood and learned from itself,−by our common notion of the
novel, a notion pieced together and produced out of custom and belief, out of accidental and arbitrary
requisitions,−is as if a child should grasp at the moon and stars, and insist on packing them into its toy−box," 5
Unhappily, the most of us have boxes; and some of them are very small!
Yet, independently of these its more recondite and dubious qualities, there are beauties in "Meister" which cannot
but secure it some degree of favour at the hands of many. The philosophical discussions it contains; its keen
glances into life and art; the minute and skilful delineation of men; the lively genuine exhibition of the scenes they
move in; the occasional touches of eloquence and tenderness, and even of poetry, the very essence of poetry; the
quantity of thought and knowledge embodied in a style so rich in general felicities, of which, at least, the new and
sometimes exquisitely happy metaphors have been preserved,−cannot wholly escape an observing reader, even on
the most cursory perusal. To those who have formed for themselves a picture of the world, who have drawn out,
from the thousand variable circumstances of their being, a philosophy of life, it will be interesting and instructive
to see how man and his concerns are represented in the first of European minds: to those who have penetrated to
the limits of their own conceptions, and wrestled with thoughts and feelings too high for them, it will be pleasing
and profitable to see the horizon of their certainties widened, or at least separated with a firmer line from the
impalpable obscure which surrounds it on every side. Such persons I can fearlessly invite to study "Meister."
Across the disfigurement of a translation, they will not fail to discern indubitable traces of the greatest genius in
our times. And the longer they study, they are likely to discern them the more distinctly. New charms will
successively arise to view; and of the many apparent blemishes, while a few superficial ones may be confirmed,
the greater and more important part will vanish, or even change from dark to bright. For, if I mistake not, it is with
"Meister" as with every work of real and abiding excellence, the first glance is the least favourable. A picture of
Raphael, a Greek statue, a play of Sophocles or Shakspeare, appears insignificant to the unpractised eye; and not
till after long and patient and intense examination, do we begin to descry the earnest features of that beauty, which
has its foundation in the deepest nature of man, and will continue to be pleasing through all ages.
If this appear excessive praise, as applied in any sense to "Meister," the curious sceptic is desired to read and
weigh the whole performance, with all its references, relations, purposes; and to pronounce his verdict after he has
clearly seized and appreciated them all. Or if a more faint conviction will suffice, let him turn to the picture of
Wilhelm's states of mind in the end of the first Book, and the beginning of the second; the eulogies of commerce
and poesy, which follow; the description of Hamlet; the character of histrionic life in Serlo and Aurelia; that of
sedate and lofty manhood in the Uncle and Lothario. But above all, let him turn to the history of Mignon. This
mysterious child, at first neglected by the reader, gradually forced on his attention, at length overpowers him with
an emotion more deep and thrilling than any poet since the days of Shakspeare has succeeded in producing. The
daughter of enthusiasm, rapture, passion and despair, she is of the earth, but not earthly. When she glides before
us through the light mazes of her fairy dance, or twangs her cithern to the notes of her homesick verses, or whirls
her tambourine and hurries round us like an antique Manad, we could almost fancy her a spirit; so pure is she, so
full of fervour, so disengaged from the clay of this world. And when all the fearful particulars of her story are at
Translator's Preface

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
length laid together, and we behold in connected order the image of her hapless existence, there is, in those dim
recollections, those feelings so simple, so impassioned and unspeakable, consuming the closely−shrouded,
woe−struck, yet ethereal spirit of the poor creature, something which searches into the inmost recesses of the soul.
It is not tears which her fate calls forth; but a feeling far too deep for tears. The very fire of heaven seems
miserably quenched among the obstructions of this earth. Her little heart, so noble and so helpless, perishes before
the smallest of its many beauties is unfolded; and all its loves and thoughts and longings do but add another pang
to death, and sink to silence utter and eternal. It is as if the gloomy porch of Dis, and his pale kingdoms, were
realised and set before us, and we heard the ineffectual wail of infants reverberating from within their
prison−walls forever.Continu" audita voces, vagitus et ingens,Infantumque anima flentes in limine primo:Quos
dulcis vita exsortes, et ab ubere raptos,Abstulit atra dies, et funere mersit acerbo.This history of Mignon runs like
a thread of gold through the tissue of the narrative, connecting with the heart much that were else addressed only
to the head: Philosophy and eloquence might have done the rest; but this is poetry in the highest meaning of the
word. It must be fore the power of producing such creations and emotions, that Goethe is by many of his
countrymen ranked at the side of Homer and Shakspeare, as one of the only three men of genius that have ever
lived.
But my business here is not to judge of "Meister" or its Author, it is only to prepare others for judging it; and for
this purpose the most that I had room to say is said. All I ask in the name of this illustrious foreigner is, that the
court which tries him be pure, and the jury instructed in the cause; that the work be not condemned for wanting
what it was not meant to have, and by persons nowise called to pass sentence on it.
Respecting my own humble share in the adventure, it is scarcely necessary to say anything. Fidelity is all the
merit I have aimed at: to convey the Author's sentiments, as he himself expressed them; to follow the original, in
all the variations of its style, has been my constant endeavour. In many points, both literary and moral, I may have
wished devoutly that he had not written as he has done; but to alter anything was not in my commission. The
literary and moral persuasions of a man like Goethe are objects of a rational curiosity; and the duty of a translator
is simple and distinct. Accordingly, except a few phrases and sentences, not in all amounting to a page, which I
have dropped as evidently unfit for the English taste, I have studied to present the work exactly as it stands in
German. That my success has been indifferent, I already know too well. In rendering the ideas of Goethe, often so
subtle, so capriciously expressive, the meaning was not always easy to seize, or to convey with adequate effect.
There were thin tints of style, shades of ridicule or tenderness or solemnity, resting over large spaces, and so
slight as almost to be evanescent: some of these I may have failed to see; to many of them I could do no justice.
Nor, even in plainer matters, can I pride myself in having always imitated his colloquial familiarity without falling
into sentences bald and rugged, into idioms harsh or foreign; or in having copied the flowing oratory of other
passages, without at times exaggerating or defacing the swelling cadences and phrases of my original. But what
work, from the translating of a German novel to the writing of an epic, was ever as the workman wished and
meant it? This version of "Meister", with whatever faults it may have, I honestly present to my countrymen: if,
while it makes any portion of them more familiar with the richest, most gifted of living minds, it increase their
knowledge, or even afford them a transient amusement, they will excuse its errors, and I shall be far more than
paid for all my labour.

Chapter I
THE PLAY was late in breaking up: old Barbara went more than once to the window, and listened for the sound
of carriages. She was waiting for Mariana, her pretty mistress, who had that night, in the afterpiece, been acting
the part of a young officer, to the no small delight of the public. Barbara's impatience was greater than it used to
be, when she had nothing but a frugal supper to present: on this occasion, Mariana was to be surprised with a
packet, which Norberg, a young and wealthy merchant, had sent by the post, to show that, in absence, he still
thought of his love.
As an old servant, as confidante, counsellor, manager and housekeeper, Barbara assumed the privilege of opening
seals; and this evening she the less had been able to restrain her curiosity, as the favour of the open−handed
gallant was more a matter of anxiety with herself than with her mistress. On breaking up the packet, she had
found, with unfeigned satisfaction, that it held a piece of fine muslin and some ribbons of the newest fashion for
Mariana; with a quantity of calico, two or three neckerchiefs, and a moderate rouleau of money, for herself. Her
esteem for the absent Norberg was of course unbounded: she meditated only how she might best present him to
the mind of Mariana, best bring to her recollection what she owed him, and what he had a right to expect from her
fidelity and thankfulness.
The muslin, with the ribbons half unrolled, to set it off by their colours, lay like a Christmas−present on the small
table; the position of the lights increased the glitter of the gift; all was in order, when the old woman heard
Mariana's step on the stairs, and hastened to meet her. But what was her disappointment, when the little female
officer, without deigning to regard her caresses, rushed past her with unusual speed and agitation; threw her hat
and sword upon the table, and walked hastily up and down, bestowing not a look on the lights, or any portion of
the apparatus!

"What ails thee, my darling?" exclaimed the astonished Barbara; "for Heaven's sake, what is the matter? Look
here, my pretty child! See what a present! And who could have sent it but thy kindest of friends? Norberg has
given thee the muslin to make a nightgown of: he will soon be here himself; he seems to be fonder and more
generous than ever."
Barbara went to the table, that she might exhibit the memorials with which Norberg had likewise honoured her,
when Mariana, turning away from the presents, exclaimed with vehemence:
"Off! off! Not a word of all this tonight! I have yielded to thee; thou hast willed it; be it so! When Norberg comes,
I am his, am thine, am any one's; make of me what thou pleasest: but till then I will be my own; and, if thou hadst
a thousand tongues, thou shouldst never talk me from my purpose. All, all that is my own will I give up to him
who loves me; whom I love. No sour faces! I will abandon myself to this affection, as if it were to last forever."
The old damsel had abundance of objections and serious considerations to allege; in the progress of the dialogue,
she was growing bitter and keen, when Mariana sprang at her, and seized her by the breast. The old damsel
laughed aloud. "I must have a care," she cried, "that you don't get into pantaloons again, if I mean to be sure of my
life! Come, doff you! The girl will beg my pardon for the foolish things the boy is doing to me. Off with the
frock! Off with them all! The dress beseems you not; it is dangerous for you, I observe; the epaulets make you too
bold."
Thus speaking she had laid hands upon her mistress; Mariana pushed her off, exclaiming, "Not so fast. I expect a
visit tonight."
"Visit!" rejoined Barbara; "you surely do not look for Meister, the young, soft−hearted, callow merchant's son?"
"Just for him," replied Mariana.
"Generosity appears to be growing your ruling passion," said the old woman with a grin; "you connect yourself
with minors and moneyless people, as if they were the chosen of the earth. Doubtless it is charming to be
worshipped as a benefactress."
"Jeer as thou pleasest. I love him! I love him! With what rapture do I now, for the first time, speak the word! This
is the passion which I have mimicked so often, when I knew not what it meant. Yes! I will throw myself about his
neck; I will clasp him as if I could hold him forever. I will show him all my love; will enjoy all his in its whole
extent."
"Moderate yourself," said the old dame coolly; "moderate yourself! A single word will interrupt your rapture:
Norberg is coming! Coming in a fortnight! Here is the letter that arrived with the packet."
"And, though the morrow were to rob me of my friend, I would conceal it from myself and him. A fortnight! An
age! Within a fortnight, what may not happen, what may not alter?"
Here Wilhelm entered. We need not say how fast she flew to meet him; with what rapture he clasped the red
uniform, and pressed the beautiful wearer of it to his bosom. It is not for us to describe the blessedness of two
lovers. Old Barbara went grumbling away: we shall retire with her, and leave the happy two alone.

with him, and meant to forbid him these daily visits to the playhouse. "Though I myself often go with pleasure to

the theatre," she continued, "I could almost detest it entirely, when I think that our fireside peace is broken by
your excessive passion for that amusement. Your father is ever repeating: What is the use of it? How can any one
waste his time so?"
"He has already told me this," said Wilhelm; "and perhaps I answered him too hastily; but, for Heaven's sake,
mother, is nothing then of use but what immediately puts money in our purse; but what procures us some property
that we can lay our hands on? Had we not, for instance, room enough in the old house; and was it indispensable to
build a new one? Does not my father every year expend a large part of his profit in ornamenting his chambers?
Are not these silk carpets, this English furniture, likewise of no use? Might we not content ourselves with worse?
For my own part, I confess, these striped walls, these hundred times repeated flowers, and knots, and baskets, and
figures, produce a really disagreeable effect upon me. At best, they but remind me of the front curtain of our
theatre. But what a different thing it is to sit and look at that! There, if you must wait for a while, you are always
sure that it will rise at last, and disclose to you a thousand curious objects, to entertain, to instruct and to exalt
you."
"But you go to excess with it," said the mother; "your father wishes to be entertained in the evenings as well as
you; besides, he thinks it dissipates your attention; and when he grows ill−humoured on the subject, it is I that
must bear the blame. How often have I been upbraided with that miserable puppet−show, which I was unlucky
enough to provide for you at Christmas, twelve years ago! It was the first thing that put these plays into your
head."
"O, do not blame the poor puppets; do not repent of your love and motherly care! It was the only happy hour I had
enjoyed in the new empty house. I never can forget that hour; I see it still before me; I recollect how surprised I
was when, after we had got our customary presents, you made us seat ourselves before the door that leads to the
other room. The door opened; but not as formerly, to let us pass and repass; the entrance was occupied by an
unexpected show. Within it rose a porch, concealed by a mysterious curtain. All of us were standing at a distance;
our eagerness to see what glittering or jingling article lay hid behind the half−transparent veil was mounting
higher and higher, when you bade us each sit down upon his stool and wait with patience.
"At length all of us were seated and silent: a whistle gave the signal; the curtain rolled aloft, and showed us the
interior of the Temple, painted in deep red colours. The high−priest Samuel appeared with Jonathan, and their
strange alternating voices seemed to me the most striking thing on earth. Shortly after entered Saul, overwhelmed
with confusion at the impertinence of that heavy−limbed warrior, who had defied him and all his people. But how
glad was I when the little dapper son of Jesse, with his crook and shepherd's pouch and sling, came hopping forth
and said: 'Dread king and sovereign lord! let no one's heart sink down because of this; if your Majesty will grant
me leave, I will go out to battle with this blustering giant.' Here ended the first act; leaving the spectators more
curious than ever to see what farther would happen, each praying that the music might soon be done. At last the
curtain rose again. David devoted the flesh of the monster to the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field; the
Philistine scorned and bullied him, stamped mightily with both his feet, and at length fell like a mass of clay,
affording a splendid termination to the piece. And then the virgins sang: 'Saul hath slain his thousands, but David
his ten thousands!' The giant's head was borne before his little victor, who received the King's beautiful daughter
to wife. Yet withal, I remember, I was vexed at the dwarfish statue of this lucky prince; for the great Goliath and
the small David had both been formed, according to the common notion, with a due regard to their figures and
proportions. I pray you, mother, tell me what has now become of those puppets? I promised to show them to a
friend, whom I was lately entertaining with a history of all this child's work."
"I can easily conceive," said the mother, "how these things should stick so firmly in your mind: I well remember
what an interest you took in them; how you stole the little book from me, and learned the whole piece by heart. I
first noticed it one evening when you had made a Goliath and a David of wax; you set them both to declaim
against each other, and at length gave a deadly stab to the giant, fixing his shapeless head, stuck upon a large pin
with a wax handle, in little David's hand. I then felt such a motherly contentment at your fine recitation and good

memory, that I resolved to give you up the whole wooden troop to your own disposal. I did not then foresee that it
would cause me so many heavy hours."
"Do not repent of it," said Wilhelm; "this little sport has often made us happy." So saying, he got the keys; made
haste to find the puppets; and, for a moment, was transported back into those times when they almost seemed to
him alive, when he felt as if he himself could give them life by the cunning of his voice and the movements of his
hands. He took them to his room, and locked them up with care.

Chapter III
IF the first love is indeed, as I hear it everywhere maintained to be, the most delicious feeling which the heart of
man, before it or after, can experience,−then our hero must be reckoned doubly happy, as permitted to enjoy the
pleasure of this chosen period in all its fulness. Few men are so peculiarly favoured; by far the greater part are led
by the feelings of their youth into nothing but a school of hardship, where, after a stinted and checkered season of
enjoyment, they are at length constrained to renounce their dearest wishes, and to learn forever to dispense with
what once hovered before them as the highest happiness of existence.
Wilhelm's passion for that charming girl now soared aloft on the wings of imagination: after a short acquaintance,
he had gained her affections; he found himself in possession of a being whom with all his heart he not only loved,
but honoured: for she had first appeared before him in the flattering light of theatric pomp, and his passion for the
stage combined itself with his earliest love for woman. His youth allowed him to enjoy rich pleasures, which the
activity of his fancy exalted and maintained. The situation of his mistress, too, gave a turn to her conduct, which
greatly enlivened his emotions. The fear, lest her lover might, before the time, detect the real state in which she
stood, diffused over all her conduct an interesting tinge of anxiety and bashfulness; her attachment to the youth
was deep; her inquietude itself appeared but to augment her tenderness; she was the loveliest of creatures while
beside him.
When the first tumult of joy had passed, and our friend began to look back upon his life and its concerns,
everything appeared new to him; his duties seemed holier, his inclinations keener, his knowledge clearer, his
talents stronger, his purposes more decided. Accordingly, he soon fell upon a plan to avoid the reproaches of his
father, to still the cares of his mother, and at the same time to enjoy Mariana's love without disturbance. Through
the day he punctually transacted his business, commonly forbore attending the theatre, strove to be entertaining at
table in the evening; and when all were asleep, he glided softly out into the garden, and hastened, wrapt up in his
mantle, with all the feelings of Leander in his bosom, to meet his mistress without delay.
"What is this you bring?" inquired Mariana, as he entered one evening, with a bundle, which Barbara, in hopes it
might turn out to be some valuable present, fixed her eyes upon with great attention. "You will never guess," said
Wilhelm.
Great was the surprise of Mariana, great the scorn of Barbara, when the napkin being loosened gave to view a
perplexed multitude of span−long puppets. Mariana laughed aloud, as Wilhelm set himself to disentangle the
confusion of the wires, and show her each figure by itself. Barbara glided sulkily out of the room.
A very little thing will entertain two lovers; and accordingly our friends, this evening, were as happy as they
wished to be. The little troop was mustered; each figure was minutely examined, and laughed at, in its turn. King
Saul, with his golden crown and his black velvet robe, Mariana did not like; he looked, she said, too stiff and
pedantic. She was far better pleased with Jonathan, his sleek chin, his turban, his cloak of red and yellow. She
soon got the art of turning him deftly on his wire; she made him bow, and repeat declarations of love. On the
other hand, she refused to give the least attention to the prophet Samuel, though Wilhelm commended the
pontifical breastplate, and told her that the taffeta of the cassock had been taken from a gown of his own
Chapter III

grandmother's. David she thought too small, Goliath was too large; she held by Jonathan. She grew to manage
him so featly, and at last to extend her caresses from the puppet to its owner, that, on this occasion, as on others, a
silly sport became the introduction to happy hours.
Their soft, sweet dreams were broken in upon by a noise which arose on the street. Mariana called for the old
dame, who, as usual, was occupied in furbishing the changeful materials of the playhouse wardrobe for the
service of the piece next to be acted. Barbara said, the disturbance arose from a set of jolly companions, who were
just then sallying out of the Italian Tavern, hard by, where they had been busy discussing fresh oysters, a cargo of
which had just arrived, and by no means sparing their champagne.
"Pity," Mariana said, "that we did not think of it in time; we might have had some entertainment to ourselves."
"It is not yet too late," said Wilhelm, giving Barbara a louis−d'or: "get us what we want; then come and take a
share with us."
The old dame made speedy work; ere long a trimly−covered table, with a neat collation, stood before the lovers.
They made Barbara sit with them; they ate and drank, and enjoyed themselves.
On such occasions, there is never want of enough to say. Mariana soon took up little Jonathan again, and the old
dame turned the conversation upon Wilhelm's favourite topic. "You were once telling us," she said, "about the
first exhibition of a puppet−show on Christmas−eve: I remember you were interrupted, just as the ballet was
going to begin. We have now the pleasure of a personal acquaintance with the honourable company by whom
those wonderful effects were brought about."
"O yes!" cried Mariana, "do tell us how it all went on, and how you felt then."
"It is a fine emotion, Mariana," said the youth, "when we bethink ourselves of old times, and old harmless errors;
especially if this is at a period when we have happily gained some elevation, from which we can look around us,
and survey the path we have left behind. It is so pleasant to think, with composure and satisfaction, of many
obstacles, which often with painful feelings we may have regarded as invincible; pleasant to compare what we
now are, with what we then were struggling to become. But I am happy above others in this matter, that I speak to
you about the past, at a moment when I can also look forth into the blooming country, which we are yet to wander
through together, hand in hand."
"But how was it with the ballet?" said Barbara. "I fear it did not quite go off as it should have done."
"I assure you," said Wilhelm, "it went off quite well. And certainly the strange caperings of these Moors and
Mooresses, these shepherds and shepherdesses, these dwarfs and dwarfesses, will never altogether leave my
recollection, while I live. When the curtain dropped, and the door closed, our little party skipped away, frolicking
as if they had been tipsy, to their beds; for myself, however, I remember that I could not go to sleep: still wanting
to have something told me on the subject, I continued putting questions to every one, and would hardly let the
maid away who had brought me up to bed.
"Next morning, alas! the magic apparatus had altogether vanished; the mysterious veil was carried off, the door
permitted us again to go and come through it without obstruction; the manifold adventures of the evening had
passed away, and left no trace behind. My brothers and sisters were running up and down with their playthings; I
alone kept gliding to and fro; it seemed to me impossible that two bare door−posts could be all that now remained,
where the night before so much enchantment had displayed itself. Alas! the man that seeks a lost love can hardly
be unhappier than I then thought myself."

Chapter III

A rapturous look, which he cast on Mariana, convinced her that he was not much afraid of ever having a
misfortune such as this to strive with.

Chapter IV
"MY sole wish now," continued Wilhelm, "was to witness a second exhibition of the piece. For this purpose I had
recourse, by constant entreaties, to my mother; and she attempted in a favourable hour to persuade my father. Her
labour, however, was in vain. My father's principle was, that none but enjoyments of rare occurrence were
adequately prized; that neither young nor old could set a proper value on pleasures which they tasted every day.
"We might have waited long, perhaps till Christmas returned, had not the contriver and secret director of the
spectacle himself felt a pleasure in repeating the display of it; partly incited, I suppose, by the wish to produce a
brand−new Harlequin expressly prepared for the afterpiece.
"A young officer of the artillery, a person of great gifts in all sorts of mechanical contrivance, had served my
father in many essential particulars during the building of the house; for which, having been handsomely
rewarded, he felt desirous of expressing his thankfulness to the family of his patron, and so made us young ones a
present of this complete theatre, which, in hours of leisure, he had already carved and painted and strung together.
It was this young man, who, with the help of a servant, had himself managed the puppets, disguising his voice to
pronounce their various speeches. He had no great difficulty in persuading my father, who granted, out of
complaisance to a friend, what he had denied from conviction to his children. In short, our theatre was again set
up, some little ones of the neighbourhood were invited, and the piece was again represented.
"If I had formerly experienced the delights of surprise and astonishment, I enjoyed on this second occasion the
pleasure of examining and scrutinising. How all this happened was my present concern. That the puppets
themselves did not speak, I had already decided; that of themselves they did not move, I also conjectured: but then
how came it all to be so pretty, and to look just as if they both spoke and moved of themselves; and where were
the lights, and the people that managed the deception? These enigmas perplexed me the more, as I wished at once
to be among the enchanters and the enchanted, at once to have a secret hand in the play, and to enjoy, as a
looker−on, the pleasure of illusion.
"The piece being finished, preparations were making for the farce; the spectators had risen, and were all busy
talking together. I squeezed myself closer to the door, and heard, by the rattling within, that the people were
packing up some articles. I lifted the lowest screen, and poked in my head between the posts. As our mother
noticed it, she drew me back; but I had seen well enough, that here friends and foes, Saul and Goliath, and
whatever else their names might be, were lying quietly down together in a drawer; and thus my half−contented
curiosity received a fresh excitement. To my great surprise, moreover, I had noticed the lieutenant very diligently
occupied in the interior of the shrine. Henceforth, Jack−pudding, however he might clatter with his heels, could
not any longer entertain me. I sank into deep meditation; my discovery at once made me more satisfied, and less
so than before. After a little, it first struck me that I yet comprehended nothing; and here I was right; for the
connection of the parts with each other was entirely unknown to me, and everything depends on that.

Chapter V
"IN well adjusted and regulated houses," continued Wilhelm, "children have a feeling not unlike what I conceive
rats and mice to have; they keep a sharp eye on all crevices and holes, where they may come at any forbidden
dainty; they enjoy it also with a fearful, stolen satisfaction, which forms no small part of the happiness of
childhood.

Chapter IV

13

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
"More than any other of the young ones, I was in the habit of looking out attentively to see if I could notice any
cupboard left open, or key standing in its lock. The more reverence I bore in my heart for those closed doors, on
the outside of which I had to pass by for weeks and months, catching only a furtive glance when our mother now
and then opened the consecrated place to take something from it,−the quicker was I to make use of any
opportunities which the forgetfulness of our housekeepers at times afforded me.
"Among all the doors, that of the store−room was, of course, the one I watched most narrowly. Few of the joyful
anticipations in life can equal the feeling which I used to have, when my mother happened to call me, that I might
help her to carry out anything, after which I might pick up a few dried plums, either with her kind permission, or
by help of my own dexterity. The accumulated treasures of this chamber took hold of my imagination by their
magnitude; the very fragrance exhaled by so multifarious a collection of sweet−smelling spices produced such a
craving effect on me, that I never failed, when passing near, to linger for a little, and regale myself at least on the
unbolted atmosphere. At length, one Sunday morning, my mother, being hurried by the ringing of the
church−bells, forgot to take this precious key with her on shutting the door, and went away, leaving all the house
in a deep Sabbath stillness. No sooner had I marked this oversight, then gliding softly once or twice to and from
the place, I at last approached very gingerly, opened the door, and felt myself, after a single step, in immediate
contact with these manifold and long−wished−for means of happiness. I glanced over glasses, chests and bags,
and drawers and boxes, with a quick and doubtful eye, considering what I ought to choose and take; turned finally
to my dear withered plums, provided myself also with a few dried apples, and completed the forage with an
orange−chip. I was quietly retreating with my plunder, when some little chests, lying piled over one another,
caught my attention; the more so, as I noticed a wire, with hooks at the end of it, sticking through the joint of the
lid in one of them. Full of eager hopes, I opened this singular package; and judge of my emotions, when I found
my glad world of heroes all sleeping safe within! I meant to pick out the topmost, and, having examined them, to
pull up those below; but in this attempt, the wires got very soon entangled, and I fell into a fright and flutter, more
particularly as the cook just then began making some stir in the kitchen, which lay close by; so that I had nothing
for it but to squeeze the whole together the best way I could, and to shut the chest, having stolen from it nothing
but a little written book, which happened to be lying above, and contained the whole drama of Goliath and David.
With this booty I made good my retreat into the garret.
"Henceforth all my stolen hours of solitude were devoted to perusing the play, to learning it by heart, and
picturing in thought how glorious it would be, could I but get the figures, to make them move along with it. In
idea, I myself became David and Goliath by turns. In every corner of the court−yard, of the stables, of the garden,
under all kinds of circumstances, I laboured to stamp the whole piece upon my mind; laid hold of all the
characters, and learned their speeches by heart, most commonly, however, taking up the parts of the chief
personages, and allowing all the rest to move along with them, but as satellites, across my memory. Thus day and
night the heroic words of David, wherewith he challenged the braggart giant, Goliath of Gath, kept their place in
my thoughts. I often muttered them to myself, while no one gave heed to me, except my father, who, frequently
observing some such detached exclamation, would in secret praise the excellent memory of his boy, that had
retained so much from only two recitations.
"By this means, growing always bolder, I one evening repeated almost the entire piece before my mother, whilst I
was busied in fashioning some bits of wax into players. She observed it, questioned me hard, and I confessed.
"By good fortune, this detection happened at a time when the lieutenant had himself been expressing a wish to
initiate me in the mysteries of the art. My mother forthwith gave him notice of these unexpected talents; and he
now contrived to make my parents offer him a couple of chambers in the top story, which commonly stood empty,
that he might accommodate the spectators in the one, while the other held his actors, the proscenium again filling
up the opening of the door. My father had allowed his friend to arrange all this; himself, in the mean time,
seeming only to look at the transaction, as it were, through his fingers; for his maxim was, that children should not
be allowed to see the kindness which is felt towards them, lest their pretensions come to extend too far. He was of
opinion, that, in the enjoyments of the young, one should assume a serious air; often interrupting the course of
Chapter IV

their festivities, to prevent their satisfaction from degenerating into excess and presumption.

Chapter VI
"THE LIEUTENANT now set up his theatre, and managed all the rest. During the week, I readily observed that
he often came into the house at unusual hours, and I soon guessed the cause. My eagerness increased immensely;
for I well understood, that till Sunday evening I could have no share in what was going on. At last the wished−for
day arrived. At five in the evening, my conductor came and took me up with him. Quivering with joy, I entered,
and descried, on both sides of the frame−work, the puppets all hanging in order as they were to advance to view. I
considered them narrowly, and mounted on the steps, which raised them above the scene, and allowed me to
hover aloft over all that little world. Not without reverence did I look down between the pieces of board, and
recollect what a glorious effect the whole would produce, and feel into what mighty secrets I was now admitted.
We made a trial, which succeeded well.
"Next day, a party of children were invited: we performed rarely; except that once, in the fire of action, I let poor
Jonathan fall, and was obliged to reach down with my hand and pick him up again; an accident which sadly
marred the illusion, produced a peal of laughter, and vexed me unspeakably. My father, however, seemed to relish
this misfortune not a little. Prudently shrouding up the contentment he felt at the expertness of his little boy, after
the piece was finished, he dwelt on the mistakes we had committed, saying it would all have been very pretty, had
not this or that gone wrong with us.
"I was vexed to the heart at these things, and sad for all the evening. By next morning, however, I had quite slept
off my sorrow; and was blessed in the persuasion that, but for this one fault, I had played delightfully. The
spectators also flattered me with their unanimous approval; they all maintained, that though the lieutenant, in
regard to the coarse and the fine voices, had done great things, yet his declamation was in general too stiff and
affected; whereas the new aspirant spoke his Jonathan and David with exquisite grace. My mother in particular
commended the gallant tone in which I had challenged Goliath, and acted the modest victor before the king.
"From this time, to my extreme delight, the theatre continued open; and as the spring advanced, so that fires could
be dispensed with, I passed all my hours of recreation lying in the garret, and making the puppets caper and play
together. Often I invited up my comrades, or my brothers and sisters; but when they would not come, I stayed by
myself not the less. My imagination brooded over that tiny world, which soon afterwards acquired another form.
"Scarcely had I once or twice exhibited the first piece, for which my scenery and actors had been formed and
decorated, till it ceased to give me any pleasure. On the other hand, among some books of my grandfather's I had
happened to fall in with the German Theatre, and a few translations of Italian operas; in which works I soon got
very deeply immersed, on each occasion first reckoning up the characters, and then, without farther ceremony,
proceeding to exhibit the piece. King Saul with his black velvet cloak, was therefore now obliged to personate
Darius or Cato, or some other pagan hero; in which cases, it may be observed, the plays were never wholly
represented; for most part, only the fifth act, where the cutting and stabbing lay.
"It was natural that the operas, with their manifold adventures and vicissitudes, should attract me more than
anything beside. In these compositions I found stormy seas, gods descending in chariots of cloud, and, what most
of all delighted me, abundance of thunder and lightning. I did my best with pasteboard, paint, and paper; I could
make night very prettily; my lightning was fearful to behold; only my thunder did not always prosper, which,
however, was of less importance. In operas, moreover, I found frequent opportunities of introducing my David
and Goliath, persons whom the regular drama would hardly admit. Daily I felt more attachment for the hampered
spot where I enjoyed so many pleasures; and, I must confess, the fragrance which the puppets had acquired from
the storeroom added not a little to my satisfaction.

Chapter VI

15

"The decorations of my theatre were now in a tolerable state of completeness. I had always had the knack of
drawing with compasses, and clipping pasteboard, and colouring figures; and here it served me in good stead. But
the more sorry was I, on the other hand, when, as frequently happened, my stock of actors would not suffice for
representing great affairs.
"My sisters dressing and undressing their dolls awoke in me the project of furnishing my heroes by and by with
garments which might also be put off and on. Accordingly, I slit the scraps of cloth from off their bodies; tacked
the fragments together as well as possible; saved a particle of money to buy new ribbons and lace; begged many a
rag of taffeta; and so formed, by degrees, a full theatrical wardrobe, in which hoop−petticoats for the ladies were
especially remembered.
"My troupe was now fairly provided with dresses for the most important piece, and you might have expected that
henceforth one exhibition would follow close upon the heels of another; but it happened with me, as it often
happens with children; they embrace wide plans, make mighty preparations, then a few trials, and the whole
undertaking is abandoned. I was guilty of this fault. My greatest pleasure lay in the inventive part, and the
employment of my fancy. This or that piece inspired me with interest for a few scenes of it, and immediately I set
about providing new apparel suitable for the occasion. In such fluctuating operations, many parts of the primary
dresses of my heroes had fallen into disorder, or totally gone out of sight; so that now the first great piece could
no longer be exhibited I surrendered myself to my imagination; I rehearsed and prepared forever; built a thousand
castles in the air, and saw not that I was at the same time undermining the foundations of these little edifices."
During this recital, Mariana had called up and put in action all her courtesy for Wilhelm, that she might conceal
her sleepiness. Diverting as the matter seemed on one side, it was too simple for her taste, and her lover's view of
it too serious. She softly pressed her foot on his, however, and gave him all visible signs of attention and
approval. She drank out of his glass: Wilhelm was convinced that no word of his history had fallen to the ground.
After a short pause, he said: "It is now your turn, Mariana, to tell me what were your first childish joys. Till now,
we have always been too busy with the present to trouble ourselves, on either side, about our previous way of life.
Let me hear, Mariana, under what circumstances you were reared; what are the first lively impressions which you
still remember?"
These questions would have very much embarrassed Mariana, had not Barbara made haste to help her. "Think
you," said the cunning old woman, "we have been so mindful of what happened to us long ago, that we have
merry things like these to talk about; and though we had, that we could give them such an air in talking of them?"
"As if they needed it!" cried Wilhelm. "I love this soft, fond, amiable creature so much, that I regret every instant
of my life which has not been spent beside her. Allow me, at least in fancy, to have a share in thy bygone life: tell
me everything; I will tell everything to thee! If possible, we will deceive ourselves, and win back those days that
have been lost to love."
"If you require it so eagerly," replied the old dame, "we can easily content you. Only, in the first place, let us hear
how your taste for the theatre gradually reached a head; how you practised, how you improved so happily, that
now you can pass for a superior actor. No doubt, you must have met with droll adventures in your progress. It is
not worth while to go to bed now: I have still one flask in reserve; and who knows whether we shall soon all sit
together so quiet and cheery again?"
Mariana cast a mournful look upon her, which Wilhelm not observing, proceeded with his narrative.

Chapter VII
"THE RECREATIONS of youth, as my companions began to increase in number, interfered with this solitary,

still enjoyment. I was by turns a hunter, a soldier, a knight, as our games required me; and constantly I had this
small advantage above the rest, that I was qualified to furnish them suitably with the necessary equipments. The
swords, for example, were generally of my manufacture; I gilded and decorated the scabbards; and a secret
instinct allowed me not to stop, till our militia was accoutred according to the antique model. Helmets, with
plumes of paper, were got ready; shields, even coats of mail, were provided; undertakings in which such of the
servants as had aught of the tailor in them, and the sempstresses of the house, broke many a needle.
"A part of my comrades I had now got well equipped; by degrees, the rest were likewise furbished up, though on a
thriftier plan; and so a very seemly corps at length was mustered. We marched about the court−yards and gardens;
smote fearfully upon each other's shields and heads: many flaws of discord rose among us, but none that lasted.
"This diversion greatly entertained my fellows; but scarcely had it been twice or thrice repeated, till it ceased to
content me. The aspect of so many harnessed figures naturally stimulated in my mind those ideas of chivalry,
which, for some time, since I had commenced the reading of old romances, were filling my imagination.
"Koppen's translation of Jerusalem Delivered at length fell into my hands, and gave these wandering thoughts a
settled direction. The whole poem, it is true, I could not read; but there were pieces of it which I learned by heart,
and the images expressed in these hovered round me. Particularly was I captivated with Clorinda, and all her
deeds and bearing. The masculine womanhood, the peaceful completeness of her being, had a greater influence
upon my mind, just beginning to unfold itself, than the factitious charms of Armida, though the garden of that
enchantress was by no means an object of my contempt.
"But a hundred and a hundred times, while walking in the evenings on the balcony which stretches along the front
of the house, and looking over the neighbourhood, as the quivering splendour streamed up at the horizon from the
departed sun, and the stars came forth, and night pressed forward from every cleft and hollow, and the small shrill
tone of the cricket tinkled through the solemn stillness,−a hundred and a hundred times have I repeated to myself
the history of the mournful duel between Tancred and Clorinda.
"However strongly I inclined by nature to the party of the Christians, I could not help declaring for the Paynim
heroine with all my heart, when she engaged to set on fire the great tower of the besiegers. And when Tancred in
the darkness met the supposed knight, and the strife began between them under that veil of gloom, and the two
battled fiercely, I could never pronounce the words,But now the sure and fated hour is nigh,Clorinda's course is
ended, she must die!without tears rushing into my eyes, which flowed plentifully, when the hapless lover,
plunging his sword into her breast, opened the departing warrior's helmet, recognised the lady of his heart, and,
shuddering, brought water to baptise her.
"How did my heart run over, when Tancred struck with his sword that tree in the enchanted wood; when blood
flowed from the gash, and a voice sounded in his ears, that now again he was wounding Clorinda; that destiny had
marked him out ever unwittingly to injure what he loved beyond all else!
"The recital took such hold of my imagination, that the passages I had read of the poem began dimly, in my mind,
to conglomerate into a whole; wherewith I was so taken that I could not but propose to have it some way
represented. I meant to have Tancred and Rinaldo acted; and for this purpose, two coats of mail, which I had
before manufactured, seemed expressly suitable. The one, formed of dark−gray paper with scales, was to serve for
the solemn Tancred; the other, of silver−and−gilt paper, for the magnificent Rinaldo. In the vivacity of my
anticipations, I told the whole project to my comrades, who felt quite charmed with it, only could not well
comprehend how so glorious a thing could be exhibited, and, above all, exhibited by them.
"Such scruples I easily set aside. Without hesitation, I took upon me in idea the management of two rooms in the
house of a neighbouring playmate; not calculating that his venerable aunt would never give them up, or
considering how a theatre could be made of them, whereof I had no settled notion, except that it was to be fixed

on beams, to have side−scenes made of parted folding−screens, and on the floor a large piece of cloth. From what
quarter these materials and furnishings were to come, I had not determined.
"So far as concerned the forest, we fell upon a good expedient. We betook ourselves to an old servant of one of
our families, who had now become a woodman, with many entreaties that he would get us a few young firs and
birches; which actually arrived more speedily than we had reason to expect. But, in the next place, great was our
embarrassment as to how the piece should be got up before the trees were withered. Now was the time for prudent
counsel! We had no house, no scenery, no curtains; the folding−screens were all we had.
"In this forlorn condition we again applied to the lieutenant, giving him a copious description of all the glorious
things we meant to do. Little as he understood us he was very helpful; he piled all the tables he could get in the
house or neighbourhood, one above the other, in a little room; to these he fixed our folding−screens; and made a
back−view with green curtains, sticking up our trees along with it.
"At length the appointed evening came; the candles were lit, the maids and children were sitting in their places,
the piece was to go forward, the whole corps of heroes was equipped and dressed,−when each for the first time
discovered that he knew not what he was to say. In the heat of invention, being quite immersed in present
difficulties, I had forgotten the necessity of each understanding what and where he was to speak; nor, in the midst
of our bustling preparations had it once occurred to the rest; each believing he could easily enact a hero, easily so
speak and bear himself, as became the personage into whose world I had transplanted him. They all stood
wonderstruck, asking: What was to come first? I alone, having previously got ready Tancred's part entered solus
on the scene, and began reciting some verses of the epic. But as the passage soon changed into narrative, and I,
while speaking, was at once transformed into a third party, and the bold Godfredo when his turn came would not
venture forth, I was at last obliged to take leave of my spectators under peals of laughter; a disaster which cut me
to the heart. Thus had our undertaking proved abortive; but the company still kept their places, still wishing to see
something. All of us were dressed; I screwed my courage up, and determined, foul or fair, to give them David and
Goliath. Some of my companions had before this helped me to exhibit the puppet−play; all of them had often seen
it: we shared the characters among us; each promised to do his best; and one small grinning urchin painted a black
beard upon his chin, and undertook, if any lacuna should occur, to fill it up with drollery as Harlequin; an
arrangement to which, as contradicting the solemnity of the piece, I did not consent without extreme reluctance;
and I vowed within myself, that, if once delivered out of this perplexity, I would think long and well before
risking the exhibition of another piece."

Chapter VIII
MARIANA, overpowered with sleep, leaned upon her lover, who clasped her close to him, and proceeded in his
narrative, while the old damsel prudently sipped up the remainder of the wine.
"The embarrassment," he said, "into which, along with my companions, I had fallen, by attempting to act a play
that did not anywhere exist, was soon forgotten. My passion for representing each romance I read, each story that
was told me, would not yield before the most unmanageable materials. I felt convinced that whatever gave delight
in narrative must produce a far deeper impression when exhibited: I wanted to have everything before my eyes,
everything brought forth upon the stage. At school, when the elements of general history were related to us, I
carefully marked the passages where any person had been slain or poisoned in a singular way; and my
imagination, glancing rapidly along the exposition and intrigue, hastened to the interesting fifth act. Indeed I
actually began to write some pieces from the end backwards; without, however, in any of them reaching the
beginning.
"At the same time, partly by inclination, partly by the counsel of my good friends, who had caught the fancy of
acting plays, I read a whole wilderness of theatrical productions, as chance put them into my hands. I was still in
Chapter VIII

18

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
those happy years when all things please us, when number and variety yield us abundant satisfaction.
Unfortunately, too, my taste was corrupted by another circumstance. Any piece delighted me especially, in which
I could hope to give delight; there were few which I did not peruse in this agreeable delusion; and my lively
conceptive power enabling me to transfer myself into all the characters, seduced me to believe that I might
likewise represent them all. Hence, in the distribution of the parts, I commonly selected such as did not fit me; and
always more than one part, if I could by any means accomplish more.
"In their games, children can make all things out of any: a staff becomes a musket, a splinter of wood a sword,
any bunch of cloth a puppet, any crevice a chamber. Upon this principle was our private theatre got up. Totally
unacquainted with the measure of our strength, we undertook all; we stuck at no quid pro quo, and felt convinced
that every one would take us for what we gave ourselves out to be. Now, however, our affairs went on so soberly
and smoothly, that I have not even a curious insipidity to tell you of. We first played all the few pieces in which
only males are requisite; next, we travestied some of ourselves; and at last took our sisters into the concern along
with us. In one or two houses, our amusement was looked upon as profitable, and company invited to see it. Nor
did our lieutenant of artillery now turn his back upon us. He showed us how we ought to make our exits and our
entrances; how we should declaim, and with what attitudes and gestures. Yet generally he earned small thanks for
his toil; we conceived ourselves to be much deeper in the secrets of theatrical art than he himself was.
"We very soon began to grow tired of tragedy: for all of us believed, as we had often heard, that it was easier to
write or represent a tragedy than to attain proficiency in comedy. In our first attempts, accordingly, we had felt as
if exactly in our element: dignity of rank, elevation of character, we studied to approach by stiffness and
affectation, and imagined that we succeeded rarely; but our happiness was not complete, except we might rave
outright, stamp with our feet, and cast ourselves upon the ground, full of fury and despair.
"Boys and girls had not long carried on these amusements in concert, till nature began to take her course, and our
society branched itself off into sundry little love−associations, as generally more than one sort of comedy is acted
in the playhouse. Behind the scenes, each happy pair pressed hands in the most tender style; they floated in
blessedness, appearing to one another quite ideal persons, when so transformed and decorated; whilst, on the other
hand, unlucky rivals consumed themselves with envy, and out of malice and spite worked every species of
mischief.
"Our amusements, though undertaken without judgment, and carried on without instruction, were not without
their use to us. We trained our memories and persons; we acquired more dexterity in speech and gesture than is
usually met with at so early an age. But for me in particular this time was in truth an epoch; my mind turned all its
faculties exclusively to the theatre, and my highest happiness was in reading, in writing, or in acting plays.
"Meanwhile the labours of my regular teachers continued; I had been set apart for the mercantile life, and placed
under the guidance of our neighbour in the counting−house; yet my spirit at this very time recoiled more forcibly
than ever from all that was to bind me to a low profession. It was to the stage that I aimed at consecrating all my
powers; on the stage that I meant to seek all my happiness and satisfaction.
"I recollect a poem, which must be among my papers, where the Muse of tragic art and another female form, by
which I personified Commerce, were made to strive very bravely for my most important self. The idea is
common, and I recollect not that the verses were of any worth; but you shall see it, for the sake of the fear, the
abhorrence, the love and passion, which reign in it. How repulsively did I paint the old housewife, with the distaff
in her girdle, the bunch of keys by her side, the spectacles on her nose; ever toiling, ever restless, quarrelsome and
penurious, pitiful and dissatisfied! How feelingly did I describe the condition of that poor man who has to cringe
beneath her rod, and earn his slavish day's−wages by the sweat of his brow!
"And how differently advanced the other! What an apparition for the overclouded mind! Formed as a queen, in
her thoughts and looks she announced herself the child of freedom. The feeling of her own worth gave her dignity
Chapter VIII

19

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
without pride: her apparel became her, it veiled each limb without constraining it; and the rich folds repeated, like
a thousand−voiced echo, the graceful movements of the goddess. What a contrast! How easy for me to decide!
Nor had I forgotten the more peculiar characteristics of my muse. Crowns and daggers, chains and masks, as my
predecessors had delivered them, were here produced once more. The contention was keen; the speeches of both
were palpably enough contrasted, for at fourteen years of age one usually paints the black lines and the white
pretty near each other. The old lady spoke as beseemed a person that would pick up a pin from her path; the other,
like one that could give away kingdoms. The warning threats of the housewife were disregarded: I turned my back
upon her promised riches; disinherited and naked, I gave myself up to the muse; she threw her golden veil over
me, and called me hers.
"Could I have thought, my dearest," he exclaimed, pressing Mariana close to him, "that another and a more lovely
goddess would come to encourage me in my purpose, to travel with me on my journey, the poem might have had
a finer turn, a far more interesting end. Yet it is no poetry; it is truth and life that I feel in thy arms; let us prize the
sweet happiness, and consciously enjoy it."
The pressure of his arms, the emotion of his elevated voice, awoke Mariana, who hastened by caresses to conceal
her embarrassment; for no word of the last part of his story had reached her. It is to be wished, that in future, our
hero, when recounting his favourite histories, may find more attentive hearers.

Chapter IX
THUS Wilhelm passed his nights in the enjoyment of confiding love; his days in the expectation of new happy
hours. When desire and hope had first attracted him to Mariana, he already felt as if inspired with new life; felt as
if he were beginning to be another man: he was now united to her; the contentment of his wishes had become a
delicious habitude. His heart strove to ennoble the object of his passion; his spirit to exalt with it the young
creature whom he loved. In the shortest absence, thoughts of her arose within him. If she had once been necessary
to him, she was now grown indispensable, now that he was bound to her by all the ties of nature. His pure soul
felt that she was the half, more than the half of himself. He was grateful and devoted without limit.
Mariana, too, succeeded in deceiving herself for a season; she shared with him the feeling of his liveliest
blessedness. Alas, if the cold hand of self−reproach had not often come across her heart! She was not secure from
it even in Wilhelm's bosom, even under the wings of his love. And when she was again left alone, again left to
sink from the clouds, to which passion had exalted her, into the consciousness of her real condition, then she was
indeed to be pitied. So long as she had lived among degrading perplexities, disguising from herself her real
situation, or rather never thinking of it, frivolity had helped her through; the incidents she was exposed to had
come upon her each by itself; satisfaction and vexation had cancelled one another; humiliation had been
compensated by vanity; want by frequent, though momentary superfluity; she could plead necessity and custom as
a law or an excuse; and hitherto all painful emotions from hour to hour, and from day to day, had by these means
been shaken off. But now, for some instants, the poor girl had felt herself transported to a better world; aloft as it
were, in the midst of light and joy, she had looked down upon the abject desert of her life, had felt what a
miserable creature is the woman who, inspiring desire, does not also inspire reverence and love; she regretted and
repented, but found herself outwardly or inwardly no better for regret. She had nothing that she could accomplish
or resolve upon. Looking into herself and searching, all was waste and void within her soul; her heart had no
place of strength or refuge. But the more sorrowful her state was, the more vehemently did her feelings cling to
the man whom she loved; her passion for him even waxed stronger daily, as the danger of losing him came daily
nearer.
Wilhelm, on the other hand, soared serenely happy in higher regions; to him also a new world had been disclosed,
but a world rich in the most glorious prospects. Scarcely had the first excess of joy subsided, when all that had
long been gliding dimly through his soul stood up in bright distinctness before it. She is thine! She has given
Chapter IX

20

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
herself away to thee! She, the loved, the wished−for, the adored, has given herself away to thee in trust and faith;
she shall not find thee ungrateful for the gift. Standing or walking, he talked to himself; his heart constantly
overflowed; with a copiousness of splendid words, he uttered to himself the loftiest emotions. He imagined that he
understood the visible beckoning of fate reaching out its hand by Mariana to save him from the stagnant, weary,
drudging life out of which he had so often wished for deliverance. To leave his father's house and people now
appeared a light matter. He was young, and had not tried the world; his eagerness to range over its expanses,
seeking fortune and contentment, was stimulated by his love. His vocation to the theatre was now clear to him; the
high goal, which he saw raised before him, seemed nearer whilst he was advancing to it with Mariana's hand in
his; and in his comfortable prudence, he beheld in himself the embryo of a great actor; the future founder of that
national theatre, for which he heard so much and various sighing on every side. All that till now had slumbered, in
the most secret corners of his soul, at length awoke. He painted for himself a picture of his manifold ideas, in the
colors of love, upon a canvas of clouds: the figures of it, indeed, ran sadly into one another; yet the whole had an
air but the more brilliant on that account.

Chapter X
HE was now in his chamber at home, ransacking his papers, making ready for departure. Whatever savoured of
his previous employment he threw aside, meaning at his entrance upon life to be free even from recollections that
could pain him. Works of taste alone, poets and critics, were, as acknowledged friends, placed among the chosen
few. Heretofore he had given little heed to the critical authors: his desire for instruction now revived, when, again
looking through his books, he found the theoretical part of them lying generally still uncut. In the full persuasion
that such works were absolutely necessary, he had bought a number of them; but, with the best disposition in the
world, he had not reached midway in any.
The more steadfastly, on the other hand, he had dwelt upon examples; and in every kind that was known to him,
had made attempts himself.
Werner entered the room; and seeing his friend busied with the well−known sheets, he exclaimed: "Again among
your papers? And without intending, I dare swear, to finish any one of them! You look them through and through
once or twice, then throw them by, and begin something new."
"To finish is not the scholar's care; it is enough if he improves himself by practice."
"But also completes according to his best ability."
"And still the question might be asked, Is there not good hope of a youth who, on commencing some unsuitable
affair, soon discovers its unsuitableness, and discontinues his exertions, not choosing to spend toil and time on
what never can be of any value?"
"I know well enough it was never your concern to bring aught to a conclusion; you have always sickened on it
before it came half−way. When you were the director of our puppet−show, for instance, how many times were
fresh clothes got ready for the dwarfish troop, fresh decorations furbished up! Now this tragedy was to be played,
now that; and at the very best you gave us some fifth act, where all was going topsy−turvy; and people cutting one
another's throats."
"If you talk of those times, whose blame really was it that we ripped off from our puppets the clothes that fitted
them, and were fast stitched to their bodies, and laid out money for a large and useless wardrobe? Was it not
yours, my good friend, who had always some fragment of ribbon to traffic with; and skill, at the same time, to
stimulate my taste, and turn it to your profit?"

Chapter X

21

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Werner laughed, and continued: "I still recollect, with pleasure, how I used to extract gain from your theatrical
campaigns, as army−contractors do from war. When you mustered for the 'Deliverance of Jerusalem,' I, for my
part, made a pretty thing of profit, like the Venetians in the corresponding case. I know of nothing in the world
more rational than to turn the folly of others to our own advantage."
"Perhaps it were a nobler satisfaction to cure men of their follies."
"From the little I know of men, this might seem a vain endeavour. But something towards it is always done, when
any individual man grows wise and rich; and generally this happens at the cost of others."
"Well, here is The Youth at the Parting of the Ways; it has just come into my hand," said Wilhelm, drawing out a
fold of papers from the rest; "this at least is finished, whatever else it may be."
"Away with it, to the fire with it!" cried Werner. "The invention does not deserve the smallest praise: that affair
has plagued me enough already, and drawn upon yourself your father's wrath. The verses may be altogether
beautiful; but the meaning of them is fundamentally false. I still recollect your Commerce personified; a
shrivelled, wretched−looking sibyl she was. I suppose you picked up the image of her from some miserable
huckster's shop. At that time, you had no true idea at all of trade; whilst I could not think of any man whose spirit
was, or needed to be, more enlarged than the spirit of a genuine merchant. What a thing it is to see the order
which prevails throughout his business! By means of this he can at any time survey the general whole, without
needing to perplex himself in the details. What advantages does he derive from the system of book−keeping by
double entry! It is among the finest inventions of the human mind; every prudent master of a house should
introduce it into his economy."
"Pardon me," said Wilhelm, smiling; "you begin by the form, as if it were the matter: you traders commonly, in
your additions and balancings, forget what is the proper net−result of life."
"My good friend, you do not see how form and matter are in this case one; how neither can exist without the
other. Order and arrangement increase the desire to save and get. A man embarrassed in his circumstances, and
conducting them imprudently, likes best to continue in the dark; he will not gladly reckon up the debtor entries he
is charged with. But on the other hand, there is nothing to a prudent manager more pleasant than daily to set
before himself the sums of his growing fortune. Even a mischance, if it surprise and vex, will not affright him; for
he knows at once what gains he has acquired to cast into the other scale. I am convinced, my friend, that if you
once had a proper taste for our employments, you would grant that many faculties of the mind are called into full
and vigorous play by them."
"Possibly this journey I am thinking of may bring me to other thoughts."
"O, certainly. Believe me, you want but to look upon some great scene of activity to make you ours forever; and
when you come back, you will joyfully enroll yourself among that class of men whose art it is to draw towards
themselves a portion of the money, and materials of enjoyment, which circulate in their appointed courses through
the world. Cast a look on the natural and artificial productions of all the regions of the earth; consider how they
have become, one here, another there, articles of necessity for men. How pleasant and how intellectual a task is it
to calculate, at any moment, what is most required, and yet is wanting, or hard to find; to procure for each easily
and soon what he demands; to lay−in your stock prudently beforehand, and then to enjoy the profit of every pulse
in that mighty circulation. This, it appears to me, is what no man that has a head can attend to without pleasure."
Wilhelm seemed to acquiesce, and Werner continued.
"Do but visit one or two great trading−towns, one or two sea−ports, and see if you can withstand the impression.
When you observe how many men are busied, whence so many things have come, and whither they are going,
Chapter X

22

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
you will feel as if you too could gladly mingle in the business. You will then see the smallest piece of ware in its
connexion with the whole mercantile concern; and for that very reason you will reckon nothing paltry, because
everything augments the circulation by which you yourself are supported."
Werner had formed his solid understanding in constant intercourse with Wilhelm; he was thus accustomed to
think also of his profession, of his employments, with elevation of soul; and he firmly believed that he did so with
more justice than his otherwise more gifted and valued friend, who, as it seemed to him, had placed his dearest
hopes, and directed all the force of his mind, upon the most imaginary objects in the world. Many a time he
thought this false enthusiasm would infallibly be got the better of, and so excellent a soul be brought back to the
right path. So, hoping in the present instance, he continued: "The great ones of the world have taken this earth of
ours to themselves; they live in the midst of splendour and superfluity. The smallest nook of the land is already a
possession, none may touch it or meddle with it; offices and civic callings bring in little profit; where, then, will
you find more honest acquisitions, juster conquests, than those of trade? If the princes of this world hold the
rivers, the highways, the havens in their power, and take a heavy tribute from everything that passes through
them, may not we embrace with joy the opportunity of levying tax and toll, by our activity, on those commodities
which the real or imaginary wants of men have rendered indispensable? I can promise you, if you would rightly
apply your poetic view, my goddess might be represented as an invincible, victorious queen, and boldly opposed
to yours. It is true, she bears the olive rather than the sword; dagger or chain she knows not; but she, too, gives
crowns to her favourites; which, without offence to yours be it said, are of true gold from the furnace and the
mine, and glance with genuine pearls, which she brings up from the depths of the ocean, by the hands of her
unwearied servants."
This sally somewhat nettled Wilhelm; but he concealed his sentiments, remembering that Werner used to listen
with composure to his apostrophes. Besides, he had fairness enough to be pleased at seeing each man think the
best of his own peculiar craft; provided only his, of which he was so passionately fond, were likewise left in
peace.
"And for you," exclaimed Werner, "who take so warm an interest in human concerns, what a sight will it be to
behold the fortune which accompanies bold undertakings distributed to men before your eyes. What is more
spirit−stirring than the aspect of a ship arriving from a lucky voyage, or soon returning with a rich capture? Not
alone the relatives, the acquaintances, and those that share with the adventures, but every unconcerned spectator
also is excited, when he sees the joy with which the long−imprisoned shipman springs on land before his keel has
wholly reached it, feeling that he is free once more, and now can trust what he has rescued from the false sea to
the firm and faithful earth. It is not, my friend, in figures of arithmetic alone that gain presents itself before us;
fortune is the goddess of breathing men; to feel her favours truly, we must live and be men who toil with their
living minds and bodies, and enjoy with them also."

Chapter XI
IT is now time that we should know something more of Wilhelm's father and of Werner's; two men of very
different modes of thinking, but whose opinions so far coincided, that both regarded commerce as the noblest
calling, and both were peculiarly attentive to every advantage which any kind of speculation might produce to
them. Old Meister, when his father died, had turned into money a valuable collection of pictures, drawings,
copperplates and antiquities; he had entirely rebuilt and furnished his house in the newest style, and turned his
other property to profit in all possible ways. A considerable portion of it he had embarked in trade, under the
direction of the elder Werner, a man noted as an active merchant, whose speculations were commonly favoured
by fortune. But nothing was so much desired by Meister as to confer upon his son those qualities of which he
himself was destitute, and to leave his children advantages which he reckoned it of the highest importance to
possess. Withal, he felt a peculiar inclination for magnificence; for whatever catches the eye, and possesses at the
same time real worth and durability. In his house he would have all things solid and massive; his stores must be
Chapter XI

23

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
copious and rich; all his plate must be heavy; the furniture of his table costly. On the other hand, his guests were
seldom invited; for every dinner was a festival, which, both for its expense and for its inconvenience, could not
often be repeated. The economy of his house went on at a settled, uniform rate; and everything that moved or had
place in it was just what yielded no one any real enjoyment.
The elder Werner, in his dark and hampered house, led quite another sort of life. The business of the day, in his
narrow counting−house, at his ancient desk, once done, Werner liked to eat well, and, if possible, to drink better.
Nor could he fully enjoy good things in solitude; with his family he must always see at table his friends, and any
stranger that had the slightest connexion with his house. His chairs were of unknown age and antique fashion; but
he daily invited some to sit on them. The dainty victuals arrested the attention of his guests, and none remarked
that they were served up in common ware. His cellar held no great stock of wine; but the emptied niches were
usually filled by more of a superior sort.
So lived these two fathers, often meeting to take counsel about their common concerns. On the day we are
speaking of, it had been determined to send Wilhelm out from home, for the dispatch of some commercial affairs.
"Let him look about him in the world," said old Meister, "and at the same time carry on our business in distant
parts. One cannot do a young man any greater kindness, than initiate him early in the future business of his life.
Your son returned so happily from his first expedition, and transacted his affairs so cleverly, that I am very
curious to see how mine will do: his experience, I fear, will cost him dearer."
Old Meister had a high notion of his son's faculties and capabilities; he said this in the hope that his friend would
contradict him, and hold up to view the admirable gifts of the youth. Here, however, he deceived himself: old
Werner, who, in practical concerns, would trust no man but such as he had proved, answered placidly: "One must
try all things; we can send him on the same journey, we shall give him a paper of directions to conduct him. There
are sundry debts to be gathered in, old connexions are to be renewed, new ones to be made. He may likewise help
the speculation I was lately talking of: for without punctual intelligence gathered on the spot, there is little to be
done in it."
"He must prepare," said Meister, "and set forth as soon as possible. Where shall we get a horse for him to suit this
business?"
"We shall not seek far. The shopkeeper in H, who owes us somewhat, but is withal a good man, has offered me a
horse instead of payment. My son knows it, and tells me it is a serviceable beast."
"He may fetch it himself; let him go with the diligence: the day after tomorrow he is back again betimes; we have
his saddle−bags and letters made ready in the mean time; he can set out on Monday morning."
Wilhelm was sent for, and informed of their determination. Who so glad as he, now seeing the means of executing
his purpose put into his hands, the opportunity made ready for him, without coöperation of his own! So intense
was his love, so full was his conviction of the perfect rectitude of his intention to escape from the pressure of his
actual mode of life, and follow a new and nobler career, that his conscience did not in the least rebel; no anxiety
arose within him; he even reckoned the deception he was meditating holy. He felt certain that, in the long−run,
parents and relations would praise and bless him for this resolution: he acknowledged in these concurring
circumstances the signal of a guiding fate.
How slowly the time passed with him till night, till the hour when he should again see his Mariana! He sat in his
chamber, and revolved the plan of his journey; as a conjuror, or a cunning thief in durance often draws out his feet
from the fast−locked irons, to cherish in himself the conviction that his deliverance is possible, nay nearer than
short−sighted turnkeys believe.

Chapter XI

24

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
At last the appointed hour struck; he went out, shook off an anxiety, and hastened through the silent streets. In the
middle of the great square, he raised his hands to the sky, feeling as if all was behind him and below him; he had
freed himself from all. One moment he figured himself as in the arms of his beloved, the next as glancing with her
in the splendours of the stage; he soared aloft in a world of hopes, only now and then the call of some watchman
brought to his recollection that he was still wandering on the vulgar earth.
Mariana came to the stairs to meet him; and how beautiful, how lovely! She received him in the new white
négligé he thought he had never seen her so charming. Thus did she handsel the gift of her absent lover in the
arms of a present one; with true passion, she lavished on her darling the whole treasure of those caresses, which
nature suggested, or art had taught: need we ask if he was happy, if he was blessed?
He disclosed to her what had passed, and showed her, in general terms, his plan and his wishes. He would try, he
said, to find a residence, then come back for her; he hoped she would not refuse him her hand. The poor girl was
silent; she concealed her tears, and pressed her friend against her bosom. Wilhelm, though interpreting her silence
in the most favourable manner, could have wished for a distinct reply; and still more, when at last he inquired of
her in the tenderest and most delicate terms, if he might not think himself a father. But to this she answered only
with a sigh, with a kiss.

Chapter XII
NEXT morning Mariana woke only to new despondency; she felt herself very solitary, she wished not to see the
light of day, but stayed in bed, and wept. Old Barbara sat down by her, and tried to persuade and console her; but
it was not in her power so soon to heal the wounded heart. The moment was now at hand, to which the poor girl
had been looking forward as to the last of her life. Who could be placed in a more painful situation! The man she
loved was departing; a disagreeable lover was threatening to come; and the most fearful mischiefs were to be
anticipated, if the two, as might easily happen, should meet together.
"Calm yourself, my dear," said the old woman; "do not spoil your pretty eyes with crying. Is it, then, so terrible a
thing to have two lovers? And though you can bestow your love but on the one, yet be thankful to the other, who,
caring for you as he does, certainly deserves to be named your friend."
"My poor Wilhelm," said the other, all in tears, "had warning that a separation was at hand. A dream discovered
to him what we strove so much to hide. He was sleeping calmly at my side; on a sudden I heard him muttering
some unintelligible sounds; I grew frightened, and awoke him. Ah! with what love and tenderness and warmth did
he clasp me! 'O Mariana!' cried he, 'what a horrid fate have you freed me from! How shall I thank you for
deliverance from such torment! I dreamed that I was far from you in an unknown country, but your figure hovered
before me; I saw you on a beautiful hill, the sunshine was glancing over it all; how charming did you look! But it
had not lasted long, till I observed your image sinking down, sinking, sinking; I stretched out my arms towards
you; they could not reach you through the distance. Your image still kept gliding down; it approached a great sea
that lay far extended at the foot of the hill, a marsh rather than a sea. All at once a man gave you his hand, and
seemed meaning to conduct you upwards, but he led you sidewards, and appeared to draw you after him. I cried
out; as I could not reach you, I hoped to warn you. If I tried to walk, the ground seemed to hold me fast; if I could
walk, the water hindered me; and even my cries were smothered in my breast.' So said the poor youth, while
recovering from his terror, and reckoning himself happy to dissipate a frightful dream by the most delicious
reality."
Barbara made every effort to reduce, by her prose, the poetry of her friend to the domain of common life;
employing, in the present case, the ingenious craft which so often succeeds with bird−catchers, when they imitate
with a whistle the tones of those luckless creatures which they soon hope to see by dozens safely lodged in their
nets. She praised Wilhelm; she expatiated on his figure, his eyes, his love. The poor girl heard her with a gratified

heart; then arose, let herself be dressed, and appeared calmer. "My child, my darling," continued the old woman in
a cozening tone, "I will not trouble you or injure you; I cannot think of tearing from you your dearest happiness.
Could you mistake my intention? Have you forgotten, that on all occasions I have cared for you more than for
myself? Tell me only what you wish; we shall soon see how it may be brought about."
"What can I wish?" said Mariana; "I am miserable, miserable for life; I love him, and he loves me; yet I see that I
must part with him, and know not how I shall survive it. Norberg comes, to whom we owe our whole subsistence,
whom we cannot live without. Wilhelm is straitened in his fortune, he can do nothing for me."
"Yes, unfortunately, he is of those lovers who bring nothing but their hearts; and these people, too, have the
highest pretensions of any."
"No jesting! The unhappy youth thinks of leaving his home, of going upon the stage, of offering me his hand."
"Of empty hands we have already four."
"I have no choice," continued Mariana; "do you decide for me! Cast me away to this side or to that; mark only one
thing: I think I carry in my bosom a pledge that ought to unite me with him still more closely. Consider and
determine: whom shall I forsake? whom shall I follow?"
After a short silence, Barbara exclaimed: "Strange, that youth should always be for extremes! To my view,
nothing would be easier than for us to combine both the profit and enjoyment. Do you love the one, let the other
pay for it: all we have to mind is being sharp enough to keep the two from meeting."
"Do as you please; I can imagine nothing, but I will follow."
"We have this advantage, we can humour the Manager's caprice, and pride about the morals of his troop. Both
lovers are accustomed already to go secretly and cunningly to work. For hours and opportunity I will take
thought; only henceforth you must play the part that I prescribe to you. Who knows what circumstances may arise
to help us? If Norberg would arrive even now, when Wilhelm is away! Who can hinder you from thinking of the
one in the arms of the other? I wish you a son, and good fortune with him; he will have a rich father."
These projects lightened Mariana's despondency only for a very short time. She could not bring her situation into
harmony with her feelings, with her convictions; she would fain have forgotten the painful relations in which she
stood, and a thousand little circumstances forced them back every moment to her recollection.

Chapter XIII
IN the mean time, Wilhelm had completed the small preliminary journey. His merchant being from home, he
delivered the letter of introduction to the mistress of the house. But neither did this lady give him much
furtherance in his purposes; she was in a violent passion, and her whole economy was in confusion.
He had not waited long till she disclosed to him, what in truth could not be kept a secret, that her stepdaughter had
run off with a player; a person who had parted lately from a small strolling company, and had stayed in the place,
and commenced teaching French. The father, distracted with grief and vexation, had run to the Amt to have the
fugitives pursued. She blamed her daughter bitterly, and vilified the lover, till she left no tolerable quality with
either: she deplored at great length the shame thus brought upon the family; embarrassing our hero not a little,
who here felt his own private scheme beforehand judged and punished, in the spirit of prophecy as it were, by this
frenzied sibyl.

Chapter XIII

26

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Still stronger and deeper was the interest he took in the sorrows of the father, who now returned from the Amt,
and with fixed sorrow, in broken sentences, gave an account of the errand to his wife; and strove to hide the
embarrassment and distraction of his mind, while, after looking at the letter, he directed that the horse it spoke of
should be given to Wilhelm.
Our friend thought it best to mount his steed immediately, and quit a house, where in its present state he could not
possibly be comfortable; but the honest man would not allow the son of one to whom he had so many obligations
to depart without tasting of his hospitality, without remaining at least a night beneath his roof.
Wilhelm assisted at a melancholy supper; wore out a restless night; and hastened to get rid of these people, who,
without knowing it, had, by their narratives and condolences, been constantly wounding him to the quick.
In a musing mood, he was riding slowly along, when all at once he observed a number of armed men coming
through the plain. By their long loose coats with enormous cuffs, by their shapeless hats, clumsy muskets, by their
slouching gait and lax attitude, he recognised in these people a detachment of provincial militia. They halted
beneath an old oak; set down their firearms; and placed themselves at their ease upon the sward to smoke a pipe
of tobacco. Wilhelm lingered near them, and entered into conversation with a young man who came up on
horseback. The history of the two runaways, which he already knew too well, was again detailed to him; and that
with comments, not particularly flattering either to the young pair themselves or to the parents. He learned also
that the military were come hither to take the loving couple into custody, who had already been seized and
detained in a neighbouring village. After some time, accordingly, a cart was seen advancing to the place, encircled
with a city−guard more ludicrous than appalling. An amorphous Town−clerk rode forth, and made his
compliments to the Actuarius (for such was the young man whom Wilhelm had been speaking to), on the border
of their several districts, with great conscientiousness and wonderful grimaces; as perhaps the ghost and the
conjuror do, when they meet, the one within the circle and the other out of it, in their dismal midnight operations.
But the chief attention of the lookers−on was directed to the cart: they could not behold without compassion the
poor misguided creatures, who were sitting upon bundles of straw, looking tenderly at one another, and scarcely
seeming to observe the bystanders. Accident had forced their conductors to bring them from the last village in that
unseemly style; the old chaise, which had previously transported the lady, having there broken down. On that
occurrence she had begged permission to sit beside her friend; whom, in the conviction that his crime was of a
capital sort, the rustic bailiffs had brought along so far in irons. These irons certainly contributed to give the
tender group a more interesting appearance, particularly as the young man moved and bore himself with great
dignity, while he kissed more than once the hands of his fair companion.
"We are unfortunate," she cried to the bystanders; "but not so guilty as we seem. It is thus that savage men reward
true love; and parents, who entirely neglect the happiness of their children, tear them with fury from the arms of
joy, when it has found them after many weary days."
The spectators were expressing their sympathy in various ways, when the officers of law having finished their
ceremonial, the cart went on, and Wilhelm, who took a deep interest in the fate of the lovers, hastened forward by
a footpath to get some acquaintance with the Amtmann before the procession should arrive. But scarcely had he
reached the Amthaus, where all was in motion, and ready to receive the fugitives, when his new friend, the
Actuarius, laid hold of him; and, giving him a circumstantial detail of the whole proceedings, and then launching
out into a comprehensive eulogy of his own horse, which he had got last night by barter, put a stop to every other
sort of conversation.
The luckless pair, in the mean time, had been set down behind at the garden, which communicated by a little door
with the Amthaus, and thus brought in unobserved. The Actuarius, for this mild and handsome treatment,
accepted of a just encomium from Wilhelm; though in truth his sole object had been to mortify the crowd
collected in front of the Amthaus, by denying them the satisfaction of looking at a neighbour in disgrace.
Chapter XIII

27

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
The Amtmann, who had no particular taste for such extraordinary occurrences, being wont on these occasions to
commit frequent errors, and with the best intentions to be often paid with sour admonitions from the higher
powers, went with heavy steps into his office−room, the Actuarius with Wilhelm and a few respectable citizens
following him.
The lady was first produced; she advanced without pertness, calm and self−possessed. The manner of her dress,
the way in which she bore herself, showed that she was a person not without value in her own eyes. She
accordingly began, without any questions being put, to speak not unskilfully about her situation.
The Actuarius bade her be silent, and held his pen over the folded sheet. The Amtmann gathered up his resolution,
looked at his assistant, cleared his throat by two or three hems, and asked the poor girl what was her name, and
how old she was.
"I beg your pardon, sir," said she, "but it seems very strange to me that you ask my name and age; seeing you
know very well what my name is, and that I am just of the age of your oldest son. What you do want to know of
me, and need to know, I will tell freely without circumlocution:−Since my father's second marriage, my situation
in his house has not been of the most enviable sort. Oftener than once I have had it in my power to make a
suitable marriage, had not my stepmother, dreading the expense of my portion, taken care to thwart all such
proposals. At length I grew acquainted with the young Melina; I felt constrained to love him; and as both of us
foresaw the obstacles that stood in the way of our regular union, we determined to go forth together, and seek in
the wide world the happiness which was denied us at home. I took nothing with me that was not my own; we did
not run away like thieves and robbers, and my lover does not merit to be hauled about in this way with chains and
handcuffs. The Prince is just, and will not sanction such severity. If we are liable to punishment, it is not
punishment of this kind."
The old Amtmann hereupon fell into double and treble confusion. Sounds of the most gracious eulogies were
already humming through his brain; and the girl's voluble speech had entirely confounded the plan of his protocol.
The mischief increased, when to repeated official questions she refused giving any answer, but constantly referred
to what she had already said.
"I am no criminal," she said. "They have brought me hither on bundles of straw to put me to shame; but there is a
higher court that will bring us back to honour."
The Actuarius, in the mean time, had kept writing down her words: he whispered the Amtmann, "just to go on; a
formal protocol might be made out by and by."
The senior then again took heart; and began, with his heavy words, in dry prescribed formulas, to seek
information about the sweet secrets of love.
The red mounted into Wilhelm's cheeks, and those of the pretty criminal likewise glowed with the charming tinge
of modesty. She was silent, she stammered, till at last her embarrassment itself seemed to exalt her courage.
"Be assured," she cried, "that I should have strength enough to confess the truth, though it made against myself:
and shall I now hesitate and stammer, when it does me honour? Yes, from the moment when I first felt certain of
his love and faith, I looked upon him as my husband; I freely gave him all that love requires, that a heart once
convinced cannot long refuse. Now do with me what you please. If I hesitated for a moment to confess, it was
owing to fear alone lest the admission might prove hurtful to my lover."
On hearing this confession, Wilhelm formed a high opinion of the young woman's feelings; while her judges
marked her as an impudent strumpet; and the townsfolk present thanked God, that in their families no such
scandal had occurred, or at least been brought to light.
Chapter XIII

28

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Wilhelm transported his Mariana into this conjuncture, answering at the bar; he put still finer words in her mouth,
making her uprightness yet more affecting, her confession still nobler. The most violent desire to help the two
lovers took possession of him. Nor did he conceal this feeling; but signified in private to the wavering Amtmann,
that it were better to end the business, all being clear as possible, and requiring no farther investigation.
This was so far of service that the young woman was allowed to retire; though, in her stead, the lover was brought
in, his fetters having previously been taken off him at the door. This person seemed a little more concerned about
his fate. His answers were more careful; and if he showed less heroic generosity, he recommended himself by the
precision and distinctness of his expressions.
When this audience also was finished, and found to agree in all points with the former, except that from regard for
his mistress, Melina stubbornly denied what had already been confessed by herself,−the young woman was again
brought forward; and a scene took place between the two, which made the heart of our friend entirely their own.
What usually occurs nowhere but in romances and plays, he saw here in a paltry court−room before his eyes; the
contest of reciprocal magnanimity, the strength of love in misfortune.
"Is it, then, true," said he internally, "that timorous affection which conceals itself from the eye of the sun and of
men, not daring to taste of enjoyment save in remote solitude and deep secrecy, yet, if torn rudely by some cruel
chance into light, will show itself more courageous, strong and resolute, than any of our loud and ostentatious
passions?"
To his comfort, the business now soon came to a conclusion. The lovers were detained in tolerable quarters: had it
been possible, he would that very evening have brought back the young lady to her parents. For he firmly
determined to act as intercessor in this case, and to forward a happy and lawful union between the lovers.
He begged permission of the Amtmann to speak in private with Melina; a request which was granted without
difficulty.

Chapter XIV
THE CONVERSATION of these new acquaintances very soon grew confidential and lively. When Wilhelm told
the downcast youth of his connexion with the lady's parents, and offered to mediate in the affair, showing at the
same time the strongest expectation of success, a light was shed across the dreary and anxious mind of the
prisoner; he felt himself already free, already reconciled with the parents of his bride; and now began to speak
about his future occupation and support.
"On this point," said our friend, "you cannot long be in difficulty; for you seem to me directed, not more by your
circumstances than by nature, to make your fortune in the noble profession you have chosen. A pleasing figure, a
sonorous voice, a feeling heart! Could an actor be better furnished? If I can serve you with a few introductions, it
will give me the greatest pleasure."
"I thank you with all my heart," replied the other; "but I shall hardly be able to make use of them; for it is my
purpose, if possible, not to return to the stage."
"Here you are certainly to blame," said Wilhelm, after a pause, during which he had partly recovered out of his
astonishment; for it had never once entered his head, but that the player, the moment his young wife and he were
out of durance, would repair to some theatre. It seemed to him as natural and as necessary as for the frog to seek
pools of water. He had not doubted of it for a moment; and he now heard the contrary with boundless surprise.

Chapter XIV

29

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
"Yes," replied Melina, "I have it in view not to reappear upon the stage; but rather to take up some civil calling, be
it what it will, so that I can but obtain one."
"This is a strange resolution, which I cannot give my approbation to. Without especial reasons, it can never be
advisable to change the mode of life we have begun with; and, besides, I know of no condition that presents so
much allurement, so many charming prospects, as the condition of an actor."
"It is easy to see that you have never been one," said the other.
"Alas, sir," answered Wilhelm, "how seldom is any man contented with the station where he happens to be
placed! He is ever coveting that of his neighbour, from which the neighbour in his turn is longing to be free."
"Yet still there is a difference," said Melina, "between bad and worse. Experience, not impatience, makes me
determine as you see. Is there in the world any creature whose morsel of bread is attended with such vexation,
uncertainty and toil? It were almost as good to take the staff and wallet, and beg from door to door. What things to
be endured from the envy of rivals, from the partiality of managers, from the ever−altering caprices of the public!
In truth, one would need to have a hide like a bear's, that is led about in a chain along with apes and dogs of
knowledge, and cudgelled into dancing at the sound of a bagpipe before the populace and children."
Wilhelm thought a thousand things, which he would not vex the worthy man by uttering. He merely, therefore,
led the conversation round them at a distance. His friend explained himself the more candidly and
circumstantially on that account. "Is not the manager obliged," said he, "to fall down at the feet of every little
Stadtrath, that he may get permission, for a month between the fairs, to cause another groschen or two to circulate
in the place? Ours, on the whole a worthy man, I have often pitied; though at other times he gave me cause
enough for discontentment. A good actor drains him by extortion; of the bad he cannot rid himself; and, should he
try to make his income at all equal to his outlay, the public immediately takes umbrage, the house stands empty;
and, not to go to wreck entirely, he must continue acting in the midst of sorrow and vexation. No, no, sir! Since
you are so good as undertake to help me, have the kindness, I entreat you, to plead with the parents of my bride;
let them get me a little post of clerk or collector, and I shall think myself well dealt with."
After exchanging a few words more, Wilhelm went away with the promise to visit the parents early in the
morning, and see what could be done. Scarcely was he by himself, when he gave utterance to his thoughts in these
exclamations: "Unhappy Melina! not in thy condition, but in thyself lies the mean impediment over which thou
canst not gain the mastery. What mortal in the world, if, without inward calling he take up a trade, an art, or any
mode of life, will not feel his situation miserable? But he who is born with capacities for any undertaking, finds in
executing this the fairest portion of his being. Nothing upon earth without its difficulties! It is the secret impulse
within; it is the love and the delight we feel, that help us to conquer obstacles, to clear out new paths, and to
overleap the bounds of that narrow circle in which others poorly toil. For thee the stage is but a few boards; the
parts assigned thee are but what a task is to a school−boy. The spectators thou regardest as on work−days they
regard each other. For thee, then, it may be well to wish thyself behind a desk, over ruled ledgers, collecting tolls,
and picking out reversions. Thou feelest not the cooperating, co−inspiring whole, which the mind alone can
invent, comprehend and complete; thou feelest not that in man there lives a spark of purer fire, which, when it is
not fed, when it is not fanned, gets covered by the ashes of indifference and daily wants; yet not till late, perhaps
never, can be altogether quenched. Thou feelest in thy soul no strength to fan this spark into a flame, no riches in
thy heart to feed it when aroused. Hunger drives thee on, inconveniencies withstand thee; and it is hidden from
thee, that, in every human condition, foes lie in wait for us, invincible except by cheerfulness and equanimity.
Thou dost well to wish thyself within the limits of a common station; for what station that required soul and
resolution couldst thou rightly fill! Give a soldier, a statesman, a divine thy sentiments, and as justly will he fret
himself about the miseries of his condition. Nay, have there not been men so totally forsaken by all feeling of
existence, that they have held the life and nature of mortals as a nothing, a painful, short and tarnished gleam of
being? Did the forms of active men rise up living in thy soul; were thy breast warmed by a sympathetic fire; did
Chapter XIV

30

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
the vocation which proceeds from within diffuse itself over all thy frame; were the tones of thy voice, the words
of thy mouth, delightful to hear; didst thou feel thy own being sufficient for thyself,−then wouldst thou doubtless
seek place and opportunity likewise to feel it in others."
Amid such words and thoughts, our friend undressed himself, and went to bed, with feelings of the deepest
satisfaction. A whole romance of what he now hoped to do, instead of the worthless occupations which should
have filled the approaching day, arose within his mind; pleasant fantasies softly conducted him into the kingdom
of sleep, and then gave him up to their sisters, sweet dreams, who received him with open arms, and encircled his
reposing head with the images of heaven.
Early in the morning he was awake again, and thinking of the business that lay before him. He revisited the house
of the forsaken family, where his presence caused no small surprise. He introduced his proposal in the most
prudent manner, and soon found both more and fewer difficulties than he had anticipated. For one thing, the evil
was already done; and though people of a singularly strict and harsh temper are wont to set themselves forcibly
against the past, and thus to increase the evil that cannot now be remedied; yet, on the other hand, what is actually
done exerts a resistless effect upon most minds; an event which lately appeared impossible takes its place, so soon
as it has really occurred, with what occurs daily. It was accordingly soon settled, that Herr Melina was to wed the
daughter; who, however, in return, because of her misconduct, was to take no marriage−portion with her, and to
promise that she would leave her aunt's legacy, for a few years more, at an easy interest, in her father's hands. But
the second point, touching a civil provision for Melina, was attended with greater difficulties. They liked not to
have the luckless pair continually living in their sight; they would not have a present object ever calling to their
minds the connexion of a mean vagabond with so respectable a family, a family which could number even a
Superintendent among its relatives; nay, it was not to be looked for, that the government would trust him with a
charge. Both parents were alike inflexible in this matter; and Wilhelm, who pleaded very hard, unwilling that a
man whom he contemned should return to the stage, and convinced that he deserved not such a happiness, could
not, with all his rhetoric, produce the slenderest impression. Had he known the secret springs of the business, he
would have spared himself the labour of attempting to persuade. The father would gladly have kept his daughter
near him, but he hated the young man, because his wife herself had cast an eye upon him; while the latter could
not bear to have, in her stepdaughter, a happy rival constantly before her eyes. So Melina, with his young wife,
who already manifested no dislike to go and see the world, and be seen of it, was obliged, against his will, to set
forth in a few days, and seek some place in any acting company where he could find one.

Chapter XV
HAPPY season of youth! Happy times of the first wish of love! A man is then like a child, that can for hours
delight itself with an echo, can support alone the charges of conversation, and be well contented with its
entertainment, if the unseen interlocutor will but repeat the concluding syllables of the words addressed to it.
So was it with Wilhelm in the earlier and still more in the later period of his passion for Mariana: he transferred
the whole wealth of his own emotions to her, and looked upon himself as a beggar that lived upon her alms; and
as a landscape is more delightful, nay is delightful only, when it is enlightened by the sun, so likewise in his eyes
were all things beautified and glorified which lay round her or related to her.
Often would he stand in the theatre behind the scenes, to which he had obtained the freedom of access from the
manager. In such cases, it is true, the perspective magic was away; but the far mightier sorcery of love then first
began to act. For hours he could stand by the sooty light−frame, inhaling the vapour of tallow lamps, looking out
at his mistress; and when she returned and cast a kindly glance upon him, he could feel himself lost in ecstasy,
and though close upon laths and bare spars, he seemed transported into paradise. The stuffed bunches of wool
denominated lambs, the waterfalls of tin, the paper roses and the one−sided huts of straw, awoke in him fair
poetic visions of an old pastoral world. Nay, the very dancing−girls, ugly as they were when seen at hand, did not
Chapter XV

31

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
always inspire him with disgust: they trod the same floor with Mariana. So true is it, that love, which alone can
give their full charm to rose−bowers, myrtle−groves and moonshine, can also communicate, even to shavings of
wood and paper−clippings, the aspect of animated nature. It is so strong a spice, that tasteless, or even nauseous
soups are by it rendered palatable.
So potent a spice was certainly required to render tolerable, nay at last agreeable, the state in which he usually
found her chamber, not to say herself.
Brought up in a substantial burgher's house, cleanliness and order were the element in which he breathed; and
inheriting as he did a portion of his father's taste for finery, it had always been his care, in boyhood, to furbish up
his chamber, which he regarded as his little kingdom, in the stateliest fashion. His bed−curtains were drawn
together in large massy folds, and fastened with tassels, as they are usually seen in thrones: he had got himself a
carpet for the middle of his chamber, and a finer one for his table; his books and apparatus he had, almost
instinctively, arranged in such a manner, that a Dutch painter might have imitated them for groups in his still−life
scenes. He had a white cap, which he wore straight up like a turban; and the sleeves of his nightgown he had
caused to be cut short, in the mode of the Orientals. By way of reason for this, he pretended that long wide sleeves
encumbered him in writing.
When, at night, the boy was quite alone, and no longer dreaded any interruption, he usually wore a silk sash tied
round his body, and often, it is said, he would fix in his girdle a sword, which he had appropriated from an old
armory, and thus repeat and declaim his tragic parts; nay, in the same trim he would kneel down and say his
evening prayer.
In those times, how happy did he think the players, whom he saw possessed of so many splendid garments,
trappings and arms; and in the constant practice of a lofty demeanour, the spirit of which seemed to hold up a
mirror of whatever, in the opinions, relations and passions of men, was stateliest and most magnificent. Of a piece
with this, thought Wilhelm, is also the player's domestic life; a series of dignified transactions and employments,
whereof their appearance on the stage is but the outmost portion; like as a mass of silver, long simmering about in
the purifying furnace, at length gleams with a bright and beautiful tinge in the eye of the refiner, and shows him,
at the same time, that the metal now is cleansed of all foreign mixture.
Great, accordingly, was his surprise at first, when he found himself beside his mistress, and looked down, through
the cloud that environed him, on tables, stools and floor. The wrecks of a transient, light and false decoration lay,
like the glittering coat of a skinned fish, dispersed in wild disorder. The implements of personal cleanliness,
combs, soap, towels, with the traces of their use, were not concealed. Music, portions of plays and pairs of shoes,
washes and Italian flowers, pincushions, hair−skewers, rouge−pots and ribbons, books and straw−hats; no article
despised the neighbourhood of another; all were united by a common element, powder and dust. Yet as Wilhelm
scarcely noticed in her presence aught except herself; nay, as all that had belonged to her, that she had touched,
was dear to him, he came at last to feel, in this chaotic housekeeping, a charm which the proud pomp of his own
habitation never had communicated. When, on this hand, he lifted aside her bodice, to get at the harpsichord; on
that, threw her gown upon the bed, that he might find a seat; when she herself, with careless freedom, did not seek
to hide from him many a natural office, which, out of respect for the presence of a second person, is usually
concealed; he felt as if by all this he was coming nearer to her every moment, as if the communion betwixt them
was fastening by invisible ties.
It was not so easy to reconcile with his previous ideas the behaviour of the other players, whom, on his first visits,
he often met with in her house. Ever busied in being idle, they seemed to think least of all on their employment
and object; the poetic worth of a piece they were never heard to speak of, or to judge of, right or wrong; their
continual question was simply: How much will it bring? Is it a stock−piece? How long will it run? How often
think you it may be played? and other inquiries and observations of the same description. Then commonly they
broke out against the manager, that he was stinted with his salaries, and especially unjust to this one or to that;
Chapter XV

32

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
then against the public, how seldom it recompensed the right man with its approval, how the German theatre was
daily improving, how the player was ever growing more honoured, and never could be honoured enough. Then
they would descant largely about winegardens and coffee−houses; how much debt one of their comrades had
contracted, and must suffer a deduction from his wages on account of; about the disproportion of their weekly
salaries; about the cabals of some rival company: on which occasions they would pass again to the great and
merited attention which the public now bestowed upon them; not forgetting the importance of the theatre to the
improvement of the nation and the world.
All this, which had already given Wilhelm many a restless hour, came again into his memory, as he walked his
horse slowly homewards, and contemplated the various occurrences in which he had so lately been engaged. The
commotion produced by a girl's elopement, not only in a decent family, but in a whole town, he had seen with his
own eyes; the scenes upon the highway and in the Amthaus, the views entertained by Melina, and whatever else
he had witnessed, again arose before him, and brought his keen forecasting mind into a sort of anxious
disquietude; which no longer to endure, he struck the spurs into his horse, and hastened towards home.
By this expedient, however, he but ran to meet new vexations. Werner, his friend and future brother−in−law, was
waiting for him, to begin a serious, important, unexpected conversation.
Werner was one of those tried sedate persons, with fixed principles and habits, whom we usually denominate cold
characters, because on emergencies they do not burst forth quickly or very visibly. Accordingly, his intercourse
with Wilhelm was a perpetual contest; which, however, only served to knit their mutual affection the more firmly;
for, notwithstanding their very opposite modes of thinking, each found his account in communicating with the
other. Werner was very well contented with himself, that he could now and then lay a bridle on the exalted but
commonly extravagant spirit of his friend; and Wilhelm often felt a glorious triumph, when the staid and thinking
Werner could be hurried on with him in warm ebullience. Thus each exercised himself upon the other; they had
been accustomed to see each other daily; and you would have said, their eagerness to meet and talk together had
even been augmented by the inability of each to understand the other. At bottom, however, being both
good−hearted men, they were both travelling together towards one goal; and they could never understand how it
was that neither of the two could bring the other over to his own persuasion.
For some time, Werner had observed that Wilhelm's visits had been rarer; that in his favourite discussions he was
brief and absent−minded; that he no longer abandoned himself to the vivid depicting of singular conceptions;
tokens by which, in truth, a mind getting rest and contentment in the presence of a friend, is most clearly
indicated. The considerate and punctual Werner first sought for the root of the evil in his own conduct; till some
rumours of the neighbourhood set him on the proper trace, and some unguarded proceedings on the part of
Wilhelm brought him nearer to the certainty. He began his investigation; and ere long discovered, that for some
time Wilhelm had been openly visiting an actress, had often spoken with her at the theatre, and accompanied her
home. On discovering the nightly visits of his friend, Werner's anxiety increased to a painful extent; for he heard
that Mariana was a most seductive girl, who probably was draining the youth of his money, while, at the same
time, she herself was supported by another and a very worthless lover.
Having pushed his suspicions as near certainty as possible, he had resolved to make a sharp attack on Wilhelm: he
was now in full readiness with all his preparations, when his friend returned, discontented and unsettled, from his
journey.
That very evening, Werner laid the whole of what he knew before him, first calmly, then with the emphatic
earnestness of a well−meaning friendship. He left no point of the subject undiscussed; and made Wilhelm taste
abundance of those bitter things, which men at ease are accustomed, with virtuous spite, to dispense so liberally to
men in love. Yet, as might have been expected, he accomplished little. Wilhelm answered with interior
commotion, though with great confidence: "You know not the girl! Appearances, perhaps, are not to her
advantage; but I am certain of her faithfulness and virtue, as of my love."
Chapter XV

Werner maintained his accusations, and offered to bring proofs and witnesses. Wilhelm waived these offers; and
parted with his friend out of humour and unhinged; like a man in whose jaw some unskilful dentist has been
seizing a diseased yet fast−rooted tooth, and tugging at it harshly to no purpose.
It exceedingly dissatisfied Wilhelm to see the fair image of Mariana overclouded and almost deformed in his soul,
first by the capricious fancies of his journey, and then by the unfriendliness of Werner. He adopted the surest
means of restoring it to complete brilliancy and beauty, by setting out at night, and hastening to his wonted
destination. She received him with extreme joy: on entering the town, he had ridden past her window; she had
been expecting his company; and it is easy to conceive that all scruples were soon driven from his heart. Nay, her
tenderness again opened up the whole stores of his confidence; and he told her how deeply the public, how deeply
his friend, had sinned against her.
Much lively talking led them at length to speak about the earliest period of their acquaintance; the recollection of
which forms always one of the most delightful topics between two lovers. The first steps that introduce us to the
enchanted garden of love are so full of pleasure, the first prospects so charming, that every one is willing to recall
them to his memory. Each party seeks a preference above the other; each has loved sooner, more devotedly; and
each, in this contest, would rather be conquered than conquer.
Wilhelm repeated to his mistress, what he had so often told her before, how she soon abstracted his attention from
the play, and fixed it on herself; how her form, her acting, her voice inspired him; how at last he went only on the
nights when she was to appear; how, in fine, having ventured behind the scenes, he had often stood by her
unheeded: and he spoke with rapture of the happy evening when he found an opportunity to do her some civility,
and lead her into conversation.
Mariana, on the other hand, would not allow that she had failed so long to notice him; she declared that she had
seen him in the public walk, and for proof she described the clothes which he wore on that occasion; she affirmed
that even then he pleased her before all others, and made her long for his acquaintance.
How gladly did Wilhelm credit all this! How gladly did he catch at the persuasion, that when he used to approach
her, she had felt herself drawn towards him by some resistless influence; that she had gone with him between the
sidescenes, on purpose to see him more closely, and get acquainted with him; and that, in fine, when his
backwardness and modesty were not to be conquered, she had herself afforded him an opportunity, and as it were
compelled him to hand her a glass of lemonade!
In this affectionate contest, which they pursued through all the little circumstances of their brief romance, the
hours passed rapidly away; and Wilhelm left his mistress, with his heart at peace, and firmly determined on
proceeding forthwith to the execution of his project.

Chapter XVI
THE NECESSARY preparations for his journey his father and mother had attended to; some little matters, that
were yet wanting to his equipage, delayed his departure for a few days. Wilhelm took advantage of this
opportunity to write to Mariana, meaning thus to bring to a decision the proposal, about which she had hitherto
avoided speaking with him. The letter was as follows: "Under the kind veil of night, which has often
overshadowed us together, I sit and think, and write to thee; all that I meditate and do is solely on thy account. O
Mariana! with me, the happiest of men, it is as with a bridegroom who stands in the festive chamber, dreaming of
the new universe that is to be unfolded to him, and by means of him, and, while the holy ceremonies are
proceeding, transports himself in longing thought before the mysterious curtains, from which the loveliness of
love whispers out to him. "I have constrained myself not to see thee for a few days; the sacrifice was easy, when
united with the hope of such a recompense, of being always with thee, of remaining ever thine! Need I repeat
Chapter XVI

34

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
what I desire? I must; for it seems as if yet thou hadst never understood me. "How often, in the low tones of true
love, which, though wishing to gain all, dares speak but little, have I sought in thy heart for the desire of a
perpetual union. Thou hast understood me, doubtless; for in thy own heart the same wish must have arisen; thou
didst comprehend me, in that kiss, in the intoxicating peace of that happy evening. Thy silence testified to me thy
modest honour; and how did it increase my love! Another woman would have had recourse to artifice, that she
might ripen by superfluous sunshine the purpose of her lover's heart, might elicit a proposal, and secure a firm
promise. Mariana, on the contrary, drew back; she repelled the half−opened confidence of him she loved, and
sought to conceal her approving feelings by apparent indifference. But I have understood thee! What a miserable
creature must I be, if I did not by these tokens recognise the pure and generous love that cares not for itself, but
for its object! Confide in me, and fear nothing. We belong to one another; and neither of us leaves aught or
forsakes aught, if we live for one another. "Take it, then, this hand! Solemnly I offer this unnecessary pledge! All
the joys of love we have already felt; but there is a new blessedness in the firm thought of duration. Ask not how;
care not. Fate takes care of love, and the more certainly as love is easy to provide for. "My heart has long ago
forsaken my paternal home; it is with thee, as my spirit hovers on the stage. O my darling! to what other man has
it been given to unite all his wishes, as it is to me? No sleep falls on my eyes; like the brightness of a perpetual
dawn, thy love and thy happiness still glow around me. "Scarcely can I hold myself from springing up, from
rushing forth to thee, and forcing thy consent, and, with the first light of tomorrow, pressing forward into the
world for the mark I aim at. But no! I will restrain myself; I will not act like a thoughtless fool; will do nothing
rashly; my plan is laid, and I will execute it calmly. "I am acquainted with the Manager Serlo; my journey leads
me directly to the place where he is. For above a year he has frequently been wishing that his people had a touch
of my vivacity, and my delight in theatrical affairs; I shall doubtless be very kindly received. Into your company I
cannot enter, for more than one reason. Serlo's theatre, moreover, is at such a distance from this, that I may there
begin my undertaking without any apprehension of discovery. With him I shall thus at once find a tolerable
maintenance; I shall look about me in the public, get acquainted with the company, and then come back for thee.
"Mariana, thou seest what I can force myself to do, that I may certainly obtain thee. For such a period not to see
thee; for such a period to know thee in the wide world! I dare not view it closely. But yet if I recall to memory thy
love, which assures me of all; if thou shalt not disdain my prayer, and give me, ere we part, thy hand, before the
priest; I may then depart in peace. It is but a form between us, yet a form so touching; the blessing of Heaven to
the blessing of the earth. Close by thy house, in the Ritterschaft Chapel, the ceremony will be soon and secretly
performed. "For the beginning I have gold enough; we will share it between us; it will suffice for both; and before
that is finished, Heaven will send us more. "No, my darling, I am not downcast about the issue. What is begun
with so much cheerfulness must reach a happy end. I have never doubted that a man may force his way through
the world, if he really is in earnest about it; and I feel strength enough within me to provide a liberal support for
two, and many more. The world, we are often told, is unthankful; I have never yet discovered that it was
unthankful, if one knew how, in the proper way, to do it service. My whole soul burns at the idea, that I shall at
length step forth and speak to the hearts of men something they have long been yearning to hear. How many
thousand times has a feeling of disgust passed through me, alive as I am to the nobleness of the stage, when I have
seen the poorest creatures fancying they could speak a word of power to the hearts of the people! The tone of a
man's voice singing treble sounds far pleasanter and purer to my ear: it is incredible how these blockheads, in
their coarse ineptitude, deform things beautiful and venerable. "The theatre has often been at variance with the
pulpit; they ought not, I think, to quarrel. How much is it to be wished, that in both the celebration of nature and
of God were intrusted to none but men of noble minds! These are no dreams, my darling! As I have felt in thy
heart that thou couldst love, I seize the dazzling thought, and say−no, I will not say, but I will hope and trust−that
we two shall yet appear to men as a pair of chosen spirits, to unlock their hearts, to touch the recesses of their
nature, and prepare for them celestial joys, as surely as the joys I have tasted with thee deserved to be named
celestial, since they drew us from ourselves, and exalted us above ourselves. "I cannot end. I have already said too
much; and know not whether I have yet said all, all that concerns thy interests; for to express the agitations of the
vortex that whirls round within myself is beyond the power of words. "Yet take this sheet, my love! I have again
read it over; I observe it ought to have begun more cautiously; but it contains in it all that thou hast need to know;
enough to prepare thee for the hour when I shall return with the lightness of love to thy bosom. I seem to myself
like a prisoner that is secretly filing his irons asunder. I bid good−night to my soundly sleeping parents. Farewell,
Chapter XVI

my beloved, farewell! For this time I conclude; my eyelids have more than once dropped together; it is now deep
in the night."

Chapter XVII
IT seemed as if the day would never end, while Wilhelm, with the letter beautifully folded in his pocket, longed to
meet with Mariana. The darkness had scarcely come on, when, contrary to custom, he glided forth to her house.
His plan was, to announce himself for the night; then to quit his mistress for a short time, leaving the letter with
her ere he went away; and, returning at a late hour, to obtain her reply, her consent, or to force it from her by the
power of his caresses. He flew into her by arms, and pressed her in rapture to his bosom. The vehemence of his
emotions prevented him at first from noticing that, on this occasion, she did not receive him with her wonted
heartiness; yet she could not long conceal her painful situation, but imputed it to slight indisposition. She
complained of a headache, and would not by any means consent to his proposal of coming back that night.
Suspecting nothing wrong, he ceased to urge her; but felt that this was not the moment for delivering his letter. He
retained it, therefore; and as several of her movements and observations courteously compelled him to take his
leave, in the tumult of unsatiable love he snatched up one of her neckerchiefs, squeezed it into his pocket, and
forced himself away from her lips and her door. He returned home, but could not rest there; he again dressed
himself, and went out into the open air.
After walking up and down several streets, he was accosted by a stranger inquiring for a certain inn. Wilhelm
offered to conduct him to the house. In the way, his new acquaintance asked about the names of the streets, the
owners of various extensive edifices, then about some police−regulations of the town; so that by the time they
reached the door of the inn, they had fallen into quite an interesting conversation. The stranger compelled his
guide to enter, and drink a glass of punch with him. Ere long he had told his name and place of abode, as well as
the business that had brought him thither; and he seemed to expect a like confidence from Wilhelm. Our friend,
without any hesitation, mentioned his name and the place where he lived.
"Are not you a grandson of the old Meister, who possessed that beautiful collection of pictures and statues?"
inquired the stranger.
"Yes, I am. I was ten years old when my grandfather died, and it grieved me very much to see those fine things
sold."
"Your father got a fine sum of money for them."
"You know of it, then?"
"O yes; I saw that treasure ere it left your house. Your grandfather was not merely a collector, he had a thorough
knowledge of art. In his younger happy years he had been in Italy; and had brought back with him such treasures
as could not now be got for any price. He possessed some exquisite pictures by the best masters. When you
looked through his drawings, you would scarcely have believed your eyes. Among his marbles were some
invaluable fragments; his series of bronzes was instructive and well chosen; he had also collected medals, in
considerable quantity, relating to history and art; his few gems deserved the greatest praise. In addition to all
which, the whole was tastefully arranged, although the rooms and hall of the old house had not been
symmetrically built."
"You may conceive," said Wilhelm, "what we young ones lost, when all these articles were taken down and sent
away. It was the first mournful period of my life. I cannot tell you how empty the chambers looked, as we saw
those objects vanishing one by one, which had amused us from our earliest years, and which we considered
equally unalterable with the house or the town itself."
Chapter XVII

36

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
"If I mistake not, your father put the capital produced by the sale into some neighbour's stock, with whom he
commenced a sort of partnership in trade."
"Quite right; and their joint speculations have prospered in their hands. Within the last twelve years, they have
greatly increased their fortunes, and are now the more vehemently bent on gaining. Old Werner also has a son,
who suits that sort of occupation much better than I."
"I am sorry the place should have lost such an ornament to it as your grandfather's cabinet was. I saw it but a short
time prior to the sale: and I may say, I was myself the cause of its being then disposed of. A rich nobleman, a
great amateur, but one who, in such important transactions, does not trust to his own solitary judgment, had sent
me hither, and requested my advice. For six days I examined the collection; on the seventh, I advised my friend to
pay down the required sum without delay. You were then a lively boy, often running about me; you explained to
me the subjects of the pictures; and in general, I recollect, could give a very good account of the whole cabinet."
"I remember such a person; but I should not have recognised him in you."
"It is a good while ago, and we all change more or less. You had, if I mistake not, a favourite piece among them,
to which you were ever calling my attention."
"O yes; it represented the history of that king's son dying of a secret love for his father's bride."
"It was not, certainly, the best picture; badly grouped, of no superiority in colouring, and executed altogether with
great mannerism."
"This I did not understand, and do not yet; it is the subject that charms me in a picture, not the art."
"Your grandfather seemed to have thought otherwise. The greater part of his collection consisted of excellent
pieces; in which, represent what they might, one constantly admired the talent of the master. This picture of yours
had accordingly been hung in the outermost room, a proof that he valued it slightly."
"It was in that room where we young ones used to play, and where the piece you mention made on me a deep
impression; which not even your criticism, greatly as I honour it, could obliterate, if we stood before the picture at
this moment. What a melancholy object is a youth that must shut up within himself the sweet impulse, the fairest
inheritance which nature has given us, and conceal in his own bosom the fire which should warm and animate
himself and others, so that his vitals are wasted away by unutterable pains! I feel a pity for the ill−fated man that
would consecrate himself to another when the heart of that other has already found a worthy object of true and
pure affection."
"Such feelings are, however, very foreign to the principles by which a lover of art examines the works of great
painters; and most probably you too, had the cabinet continued in your family, would by and by have acquired a
relish for the works themselves; and have learned to see in the performances of art something more than yourself
and your individual inclinations."
"In truth, the sale of that cabinet grieved me very much at the time; and often since I have thought of it with
regret; but, when I consider that it was a necessary means of awakening a taste in me, of developing a talent,
which will operate far more powerfully on my history than ever those lifeless pictures could have done, I easily
content myself, and honour destiny, which knows how to bring about what is best for me, and what is best for
every one."
"It gives me pain to hear this word destiny in the mouth of a young person, just at the age when men are
commonly accustomed to ascribe their own violent inclinations to the will of higher natures."
Chapter XVII

37

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
"Do you, then, believe in no destiny? No power that rules over us, and directs all for our ultimate advantage?"
"The question is not now of my belief; nor is this the place to explain how I may have attempted to form for
myself some not impossible conception of things which are incomprehensible to all of us: the question here is:
What mode of viewing them will profit us the most? The fabric of our life is formed of necessity and chance; the
reason of man takes its station between them, and may rule them both: it treats the necessary as the groundwork of
its being; the accidental it can direct and guide and employ for its own purposes; and only while this principle of
reason stands firm and inexpugnable, does man deserve to be named the god of this lower world. But woe to him
who, from his youth, has used himself to search in necessity for something of arbitrary will; to ascribe to chance a
sort of reason, which it is a matter of religion to obey! Is conduct like this aught else than to renounce one's
understanding, and give unrestricted scope to one's inclinations? We think it is a kind of piety to move along
without consideration; to let accidents that please us determine our conduct; and finally, to bestow on the result of
such a vacillating life the name of providential guidance."
"Was it never your case that some little circumstance induced you to strike into a certain path, where some
accidental occurrence ere long met you, and a series of unexpected incidents at length brought you to some point
which you yourself had scarcely once contemplated? Should not lessons of this kind teach us obedience to
destiny, confidence in some such guide?"
"With opinions like these, no woman could maintain her virtue, no man could keep the money in his purse; for
occasions enough are occurring to get rid of both. He alone is worthy of respect, who knows what is of use to
himself and others, and who labours to control his self−will. Each man has his own fortune in his hands; as the
artist has a piece of rude matter, which he is to fashion to a certain shape. But the art of living rightly is like all
arts: the capacity alone is born with us; it must be learned, and practised with incessant care."
These discussions our two speculators carried on between them to considerable length; at last they parted, without
seeming to have wrought any special conviction in each other, but engaging to meet at an appointed place next
day.
Wilhelm walked up and down the streets for a time; he heard a sound of clarionets, hunting−horns and bassoons;
it swelled his bosom with delightful feelings. It was some travelling showmen that produced this pleasant music.
He spoke with them: for a piece of coin they followed him to Mariana's house. The space in front of the door was
adorned with lofty trees; under them he placed his artists; and himself resting on a bench at some distance, he
surrendered his mind without restraint to the hovering tones which floated round him in the cool mellow night.
Stretched out beneath the kind stars, he felt his existence like a golden dream. "She, too, hears these flutes," said
he within his heart; "she feels whose remembrance, whose love of her it is that makes the night full of music. In
distance even, we are united by these melodies; as in every separation, by the ethereal accordance of love. Ah!
two hearts that love each other are as two magnetic needles; whatever moves the one must move the other with it;
for it is one power that works in both, one principle that pervades them. Can I in her arms conceive the possibility
of parting from her? And yet I am soon to be far from her; to seek out a sanctuary for our love, and then to have
her ever with me.
"How often, when absent from her, and lost in thoughts about her, happening to touch a book, a piece of dress or
aught else, have I thought I felt her hand, so entirely was I invested with her presence! And to recollect those
moments which shunned the light of day and the eye of the cold spectator; which to enjoy, the gods might
determine to forsake the painless condition of their pure blessedness! To recollect them? As if by memory we
could renew the tumultuous thrilling of that cup of joy, which encircles our senses with celestial bonds, and lifts
them beyond all earthly hindrances. And her form"−He lost himself in thoughts of her; his rest passed away into
longing; he leaned against a tree, and cooled his warm cheek on its bark; and the winds of the night wafted
speedily aside the breath, which proceeded in sighs from his pure and impassioned bosom. He groped for the
neckerchief he had taken from her; but it was forgotten, it lay in his other clothes. His frame quivered with
Chapter XVII

38

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
emotion.
The music ceased, and he felt as if fallen from the element in which his thoughts had hitherto been soaring. His
restlessness increased, as his feelings were no longer nourished and assuaged by the melody. He sat down upon
her threshold, and felt more peace. He kissed the brass knocker of her door; he kissed the threshold over which
her feet went out and in, and warmed it by the fire of his breast. He again sat still for a moment, and figured her
behind her curtains in the white nightgown, with the red ribbon round her head, in sweet repose; he almost fancied
that he was himself so near her she must needs be dreaming of him. His thoughts were beautiful, like the spirits of
the twilight; rest and desire alternated within him; love ran with a quivering hand, in a thousand moods, over all
the chords of his soul: it was as if the spheres stood mute above him, suspending their eternal song to watch the
low melodies of his heart.
Had he then had about him the master−key with which he used to open Mariana's door, he could not have
restrained himself from penetrating into the sanctuary of love. Yet he went away slowly; he slanted
half−dreaming in beneath the trees, set himself for home, and constantly turned round again; at last, with an
effort, he constrained himself, and actually departed. At the corner of the street, looking back yet once, he
imagined that he saw Mariana's door open, and a dark figure issue from it. He was too distant for seeing clearly;
and, before he could exert himself and look sharply, the appearance was already lost in the night: yet afar off he
thought he saw it again gliding past a white house. He stood and strained his eyes; but, ere he could arouse
himself and follow the phantom, it had vanished. Whither should he pursue it? What street had the man taken, if it
were a man?
A nightly traveller, when at some turn of his path he has seen the country for an instant illuminated by a flash of
lightning, will, with dazzled eyes, next moment, seek in vain for the preceding forms and the connexion of his
road: so was it in the eyes and the heart of Wilhelm. And as a spirit of midnight, which awakens unutterable
terror, is, in the succeeding moments of composure, regarded as a child of imagination, and the fearful vision
leaves doubts without and behind it in the soul: so likewise was Wilhelm in extreme disquietude, as, leaning on
the corner−stone of the street, he heeded not the clear gray of the morning, and the crowing of the cocks; till the
early trades began to stir, and drove him home.
On his way, he had almost effaced the unexpected delusion from his mind by the most sufficient reasons; yet the
fine harmonious feelings of the night, on which he now looked back as if they too had been a vision, were also
gone. To soothe his heart, and put the last seal on his returning belief, he took the neckerchief from the pocket of
the dress he had been last wearing. The rustling of a letter which fell out of it took the kerchief away from his lips;
he lifted and read:
"As I love thee, little fool, what ailed thee last night? This evening I will come again. I can easily suppose that
thou art sick of staying here so long: but have patience; at the fair I will return for thee. And observe, never more
put me on that abominable black−green−brown jacket; thou lookest in it like the witch of Endor. Did I not send
the white nightgown that I might have a snowy little lambkin in my arms? Send thy letters always by the ancient
sibyl; the Devil himself has selected her as Iris."

Book II

WHOEVER strives in our sight with vehement force to reach an object, be it one that we praise or that we blame,

him; whatever once lies finished and done, can no longer at all fix our attention, especially if we at first
prophesied an evil issue to the undertaking.
Book II

39

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Therefore we shall not try to entertain our readers with any circumstantial account of the grief and desperation
into which the ill−fated Wilhelm was cast, when he saw his hopes so unexpectedly and instantaneously ruined. On
the contrary, we shall even pass over several years, and again take up our friend, where we hope to find him in
some sort of activity and comfort. First, however, we must shortly set forth a few matters necessary for
maintaining the connexion of our narrative.
The pestilence, or a malignant fever, rages with more fierceness and speedier effect, if the frame which it attacks
was before healthy and full of vigour; and in like manner, when a luckless unlooked−for fate overtook the
wretched Wilhelm, his whole being in a moment was laid waste. As when by chance, in the preparation of some
artificial firework, any part of the composition kindles before its time; and the skilfully bored and loaded barrels,
which arranged, and burning after a settled plan, would have painted in the air a magnificently varying series of
flaming images,−now hissing and roaring, promiscuously explode with a confused and dangerous crash; so, in our
hero's case, did happiness and hope, pleasure and joys, realities and dreams, clash together with destructive
tumult, all at once in his bosom. In such desolate moments, the friend that has hastened to deliverance stands
fixed in astonishment; and for him who suffers it is a benefit that sense forsakes him.
Days of pain, unmixed, ever−returning and purposely renewed, succeeded next; still even these are to be regarded
as a grace from nature. In such hours Wilhelm had not yet quite lost his mistress; his pains were indefatigable
struggles, still to hold fast the happiness that was gliding from his soul; again to luxuriate in thought on the
possibility of it; to procure a brief after−life for his joys that had departed for ever. Thus one may look upon a
body as not utterly dead while the putrefaction lasts, while the forces that in vain seek to work by their old
appointment still labour in dissevering the particles of that frame which they once animated; and not till all is
disunited and inert, till we see the whole mouldered down into indifferent dust,−not till then does there rise in us
the mournful vacant sentiment of death; death, not to be recalled save by the breath of Him that lives forever.
In a temper so new, so entire, so full of love, there was much to tear asunder, to desolate, to kill; and even the
healing force of youth gave nourishment and violence to the power of sorrow. The stroke had extended to the
roots of his whole existence. Werner, by necessity his confidant, attacked the hated passion itself with fire and
sword, resolutely zealous to search into the monster's inmost life. The opportunity was lucky, the evidence at
hand, and many were the histories and narratives with which he backed it out. With such unrelenting vehemence
did he make his advances, leaving his friend not even the respite of the smallest momentary self−deception, but
treading−down every lurking−place, in which he might have saved himself from desperation, that nature, not
inclined to let her darling perish utterly, visited him with sickness, to make an outlet for him on the other side.
A violent fever, with its train of consequences, medicines, overstraining and exhaustion, besides the unwearied
attentions of his family, the love of his brothers and sisters, which first becomes truly sensible in time of distress
and want, were so many fresh occupations to his mind, and thus formed a kind of painful entertainment. It was not
till he grew better, in other words, till his strength was exhausted, that Wilhelm first looked down with horror into
the gloomy abyss of a barren misery, as one looks down into the hollow crater of an extinguished volcano.
He now bitterly reproached himself, that after so great a loss he could yet enjoy one painless, restful, indifferent
moment. He despised his own heart, and longed for the balm of tears and lamentation.
To awaken these again within him, he would recall to memory the scenes of his bygone happiness. He would
paint them to his fancy in the liveliest colours, transport himself again into the days when they were real; and
when standing on the highest elevation he could reach, when the sunshine of past times again seemed to animate
his limbs and heave his bosom, he would look back into the fearful chasm, would feast his eyes on its
dismembering depth, then plunge down into its horrors, and thus force from nature the bitterest pains. With such
repeated cruelty did he tear himself in pieces; for youth, which is so rich in undeveloped force, knows not what it
squanders, when to the anguish which a loss occasions, it adds so many sorrows of its own producing, as if it
meant then first to give the right value to what is gone forever. He likewise felt so convinced that his present loss
Book II

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
was the sole, the first, the last which he ever could experience in life, that he turned away from every consolation
which aimed at showing that his sorrows might be less than endless.

Chapter II
ACCUSTOMED in this way to torment himself, he now also attacked what still remained to him, what next to
love, and along with it, had given him the highest joys and hopes, his talent as a poet and actor, with spiteful
criticisms on every side. In his labours he could see nothing but a shallow imitation of prescribed forms, without
intrinsic worth; he looked on them as stiff school−exercises, destitute of any spark of nature, truth, or inspiration.
His poems now appeared nothing more than a monotonous arrangement of syllables, in which the most trite
emotions and thoughts were dragged along and kept together by a miserable rhyme. And thus did he also deprive
himself of every expectation, every pleasure, which, on this quarter at least, might have aided the recovery of his
peace.
With his theatric talent it fared no better. He blamed himself for not having sooner detected the vanity, on which
alone his pretension had been founded. His figure, his gait, his movements, his mode of declamation, were
severally taxed; he decisively renounced every species of advantage or merit, that might have raised him above
the common run of men, and so doing he increased his mute despair to the highest pitch. For, if it is hard to give
up a woman's love, no less painful is the task to part from the fellowship of the Muses, to declare ourselves
forever undeserving to be of their community; and to forego the fairest and most immediate kind of approbation,
what is openly bestowed on our person, our voice and our demeanour.
Thus then our friend had long ago entirely resigned himself, and set about devoting his powers with the greatest
zeal to the business of trade. To the surprise of friends, and to the great contentment of his father, no one was now
more diligent than Wilhelm, on the exchange or in the counting−house, in the saleroom or the warehouses;
correspondence and calculations, all that was intrusted to his charge, he attended to and managed with the greatest
diligence and zeal. Not in truth with that warm diligence which to the busy man is its own reward, when he
follows with constancy and order the employment he was born for; but with the silent diligence of duty, which
has the best principle for its foundation, which is nourished by conviction, and rewarded by conscience; yet,
which oft, even when the clearest testimony of our minds is crowning it with approbation, can scarcely repress a
struggling sigh.
In this manner he had lived for a time, assiduously busied, and at last persuaded that his former hard trial had been
ordained by fate for the best. He felt glad at having thus been timefully, though somewhat harshly warned about
the proper path of life; while many are constrained to expiate more heavily, and at a later age, the misconceptions
into which their youthful inexperience has betrayed them. For, each man commonly defends himself as long as
possible from casting out the idols which he worships in his soul, from acknowledging a master error, and
admitting any truth which brings him to despair.
Determined as he was to abandon his dearest projects, some time was still necessary to convince him fully of his
misfortune. At last, however, he had so completely succeeded by irrefragable reasons in annihilating every hope
of love, of poetical performance, or stage−representation, that he took courage to obliterate entirely all the traces
of his folly, all that could in any way remind him of it. For this purpose he had lit a fire in his chamber one cool
evening, and brought out a little chest of reliques, among which were multitudes of small articles, that, in
memorable moments, he had begged or stolen from Mariana. Each withered flower brought to his mind the time
when it bloomed fresh among her hair; each little note the happy hour to which it had invited him; each
ribbon−knot the lovely resting−place of his head, her beautiful bosom. So occupied, was it not to be expected that
each emotion, which he thought long since quite dead, should again begin to move? Was it not to be expected that
the passion, over which, when separated from his mistress, he had gained the victory, should, in the presence of
these memorials, again gather strength? We first observe how dreary and disagreeable an overclouded day is,
Chapter II

when a single sunbeam pierces through, and offers to us the exhilarating splendour of a serene hour.
Accordingly, it was not without disturbance that he saw these reliques, long preserved as sacred, fade away from
before him in smoke and flame. Sometimes he shuddered and hesitated in his task; he had still a pearl necklace
and a flowered neckerchief in his hands, when he resolved to quicken the decaying fire with the poetical attempts
of his youth.
Till now he had carefully laid up whatever had proceeded from his open, since the earliest unfolding of his mind.
His papers yet lay tied up in a bundle at the bottom of the chest, where he had packed them, purposing to take
them with him in his elopement. How altogether different were his feelings now in opening them, and his feelings
then in tying them together!
If we happen, under certain circumstances, to have written and sealed and dispatched a letter to a friend, which,
however, does not find him, but is brought back to us, and we open it at the distance of some considerable time, a
singular emotion is produced in us, on breaking up our own seal, and conversing with our altered self as with a
third person. A similar and deep feeling seized our friend, as he now opened this packet, and threw the scattered
leaves into the fire; which was flaming fiercely with its offerings, when Werner entered, expressed his wonder at
the blaze, and asked what was the matter.
"I am now giving proof," said Wilhelm, "that I am serious in abandoning a trade for which I was not born." And
with these words he cast the second packet likewise into the fire. Werner made a motion to prevent him; but the
business was already done.
"I cannot see how thou shouldst bring thyself to such extremities," said Werner. "Why must these labours,
because they are not excellent, be annihilated?"
"Because either a poem is excellent, or it should not be allowed to exist. Because each man, who has no gift for
producing first−rate works, should entirely abstain from the pursuit of art, an seriously guard himself against
every deception on that subject. For it must be owned, that in all men there is a certain vague desire to imitate
whatever is presented to them; and such desires do not prove at all that we possess the force within us necessary
for succeeding in these enterprises. Look at boys, how, whenever rope−dancers have been visiting the town, they
go scrambling up and down, and balancing on all the planks and beams within their reach, till some other charm
calls them off to other sports, for which perhaps they are as little suited. Hast thou never marked it in the circle of
our friends? No sooner does a dilettante introduce himself to notice, than numbers of them set themselves to learn
playing on his instrument. How many wander back and forward on this bootless way! Happy they, who soon
detect the chasm that lies between their wishes and their powers!"
Werner contradicted this opinion; their discussion became lively, and Wilhelm could not without emotion employ
against his friend the arguments with which he had already so frequently tormented himself. Werner maintained
that it was not reasonable wholly to relinquish a pursuit for which a man had some propensity and talent, merely
because he never could succeed in it to full perfection. There were many vacant hours, he said, which might be
filled up by it; and then by and by some result might be produced, which would yield a certain satisfaction to
himself and others.
Wilhelm, who in this matter was of quite a different opinion, here interrupted him, and said with great vivacity:
"How immensely, dear friend, do you err in believing that a work, the first presentation of which is to fill the
whole soul, can be produced in broken hours scraped together from other extraneous employment! No, the poet
must live wholly for himself, wholly in the objects that delight him. Heaven has furnished him internally with
precious gifts; he carries in his bosom a treasure that is ever of itself increasing; he must also live with his
treasure, undisturbed from without, in that still blessedness which the rich seek in vain to purchase with their
accumulated stores. Look at men, how they struggle after happiness and satisfaction! Their wishes, their toil, their
Chapter II

42

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
gold, are ever hunting restlessly; and after what? After that which the poet has received from nature,−the right
enjoyment of the world; the feeling of himself in others; the harmonious conjunction of many things that will
seldom exist together.
"What is it that keeps men in continual discontent and agitation? It is, that they cannot make realities correspond
with their conceptions, that enjoyment steals away from among their hands, that the wished−for comes too late,
and nothing reached and acquired produces on the heart the effect which their longing for it at a distance led them
to anticipate. Now fate has exalted the poet above all this, as if he were a god. He views the conflicting tumult of
the passions; sees families and kingdoms raging in aimless commotion; sees those inexplicable enigmas of
misunderstanding, which frequently a single monosyllable would suffice to explain, occasioning convulsions
unutterably baleful. He has a fellow−felling of the mournful and the joyful in the fate of all human beings. When
the man of he world is devoting his days to wasting melancholy, for some deep disappointment; or, in the
ebullience of joy, is going out to meet his happy destiny, the lightly−moved and all−conceiving spirit of the poet
steps forth, like the sum from night to day, and with soft transitions tunes his heart to joy or woe. From his heart,
his native soil, springs up the lovely flower of wisdom; and if others, while waking, dream, and are pained with
fantastic delusions from their every sense, he passes the dream of life like one awake, and the strangest of
incidents is to him but a part both of the past and of the future. And thus the poet is at once a teacher, a prophet, a
friend of gods and men. How! thou wouldst have him descend from his height to some paltry occupation? He who
is fashioned like the bird to hover round the world, to nestle on the lofty summits, to feed on buds and fruits,
exchanging gaily one bough for another, he ought also to work at the plough like an ox; like a dog to train himself
to the harness and draught; or perhaps, tied up in a chain, to guard a farm−yard by his barking!"
Werner, it may well be supposed, had listened with the greatest surprise. "All true," he rejoined, "if men were but
made like birds, and though they neither spun nor weaved, could yet spend peaceful days in perpetual enjoyment;
if, at the approach of winter, they could as easily betake themselves to distant regions, could retire before scarcity,
and fortify themselves against frost."
"Poets have lived so," exclaimed Wilhelm, "in times when true nobleness was better reverenced; and so should
they ever live. Sufficiently provided for within, they had need of little from without; the gift of communicating
lofty emotions and glorious images to men, in melodies and words that charmed the ear, and fixed themselves
inseparably on whatever objects they referred to, of old enraptured the world, and served the gifted as a rich
inheritance. At the courts of kings, at the tables of the great, beneath the windows of the fair, the sound of them
was heard, while the ear and the soul were shut to all beside; and men felt, as we do when delight comes over us,
and we stop with rapture if among the dingles we are crossing the voice of the nightingale starts out touching and
strong. They found a home in every habitation of the world, and the lowliness of their condition but exalted them
the more. The hero listened to their songs; and the conqueror of the earth did reverence to a poet, for the felt that
without poets, his own wild and vast existence would pass away like a whirlwind, and be forgotten forever. The
lover wished that he could feel his longings and his joys so variedly and so harmoniously as the poet's inspired
lips had skill to show them forth; and even the rich man could not of himself discern such costliness in his idol
grandeurs, as when they were presented to him shining in the splendour of the poet's spirit, sensible to all worth,
and exalting all. Nay, if thou wilt have it, who but the poet was it that first formed gods for us; that exalted us to
them, and brought them down to us?"
"My friend," said Werner, after some reflection, "it has often grieved me, that thou shouldst strive by force to
banish from thy soul what thou feelest so vividly. I am greatly mistaken, if it were not better for thee in some
degree to yield to these propensities, than to waste thyself by the contradictions of so hard a piece of self−denial,
and with the enjoyment of this one guiltless pleasure to renounce the enjoyment of all others."
"Shall I confess it," said the other, "and wilt thou not laugh at me if I acknowledge, that these ideas pursue me
constantly; that, let me fly them as I will, when I explore my heart, I find all my early wishes yet rooted there
firmly, nay more firmly than ever? Yet what now remains for me, wretched that I am? Ah! whoever should have
Chapter II

43

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
told me that the arms of my spirit, with which I was grasping at infinity, and hoping with certainty to clasp
something great and glorious, would so soon be crushed and smote in pieces; whoever should have told me this,
would have brought me to despair. And yet now, when judgment had been passed against me; now when she, that
was to be as my divinity to guide me to my wishes, is gone forever, what remains but that I yield up my soul to
the bitterest woes? O my brother! I will not deceive you: in my secret purposes, she was as the hook on which the
ladder of my hopes was fixed: See! With daring aim the mounting adventurer hovers in the air; the iron breaks,
and he lies broken and dismembered on the earth. No, there is no hope, no comfort for me more! I will not," he
cried out, springing to his feet, "leave a single fragment of these wretched papers from the flames." He then seized
one or two packets of them, tore them up, and threw them into the fire. Werner endeavoured to restrain him, but in
vain. "Let me alone!" cried Wilhelm; "what should these miserable leaves do here? To me they give neither
pleasant recollections, nor pleasant hopes. Shall they remain behind to vex me to the end of my life? Shall they
perhaps one day serve the world for a jest, instead of awakening sympathy and horror? Woe to me! my doom is
woe! Now I comprehend the wailings of the poets, of the wretched whom necessity has rendered wise. How long
did I look upon myself as invulnerable and invincible; and alas! I am now made to see that a deep and early
sorrow can never heal, can never pass away; I feel that I shall take it with me to my grave. No! not a day of my
life shall escape this anguish, which at last must crush me down; and her image too shall stay with me, shall live
and die with me, the image of the worthless!−O my friend! if I must speak the feeling o my heart,−the perhaps not
altogether worthless! Her situation, the crookedness of her destiny, have a thousand times excused her in my
mind. I have been too cruel; you steeled me in your own cold unrelenting harshness; you held my wavering senses
captive, and hindered me from doing for myself and her what I owed to both. Who knows to what a state I may
have brought her; my conscience by degrees presents to me, in all its heaviness, in what helplessness, in what
despair I may have left her. Was it not possible that she might clear herself? Was it not possible? How many
misconceptions throw the world into perplexity; how many circumstances may extort forgiveness for the greatest
fault! Often do I figure her as sitting by herself in silence, leaning on her elbows. 'This,' she says, 'is the faith, the
love he swore to me! With this hard stroke to end the delicious life which made us one!"' He broke out into a
stream of tears, while he threw himself down with his face upon the table, and wetted the remaining papers with
his weeping.
Werner stood beside him in the deepest perplexity. He had not anticipated this fierce ebullition of feeling. More
than once he had tried to interrupt his friend, more than once to lead the conversation elsewhere, but in vain; the
current was too strong for him. It remained that long−suffering friendship should again take up her office. Werner
allowed the first shock of sorrow to pass over, while by his silent presence he testified a pure and honest
sympathy. And thus they both remained that evening: Wilhelm sunk in the dull feeling of old sorrows; and the
other terrified at this new outbreaking of a passion, which he thought his prudent counsels and keen persuasion
had long since mastered and destroyed.

Chapter III
AFTER such relapses, Wilhelm usually applied himself to business and activity with augmented ardour; and he
found it the best means to escape the labyrinth into which he had again been tempted to enter. His attractive way
of treating strangers, the ease with which he carried on a correspondence in any living language, more and more
increased the hopes of his father and his trading friends; and comforted them in their sorrow for his sickness, the
origin of which had not been known, and for the pause which had thus interrupted their plan. They determined a
second time on Wilhelm's setting out to travel; and we now find him on horseback, with his saddle−bags behind
him, exhilarated by the motion and the free air, approaching the mountains, where he had some affairs to settle.
He winded slowly on his path, through dales and over hills, with a feeling of the greatest satisfaction.
Overhanging cliffs, roaring brooks, moss−grown rocky walls, deep precipices, he here saw for the first time; yet
his earliest dreams of youth had wandered among such regions. In these scenes, he felt his age renewed; all the
sorrows he had undergone were obliterated from his soul; with unbroken cheerfulness he repeated to himself
Chapter III

44

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
passages of various poems, particularly of the Pastor Fido, which, in these solitary places, flocked in crowds into
his mind. He also recollected many pieces of his own songs, and recited them with a peculiar contentment. He
peopled the world which lay before him with all the forms of the past; and each step into the future was to him
full of augury of important operations and remarkable events.
Several men, who came behind him in succession, and saluted him as they passed by to continue their hasty way
into the mountains, by steep footpaths, sometimes interrupted his thoughts without attracting his attention to
themselves. At last a communicative traveller joined him, and explained the reason of this general pilgrimage.
"At Hochdorf," he said, "there is a play to be acted tonight, and the whole neighbourhood is gathering to see it."
"How!" cried Wilhelm. "In these solitary hills, among these impenetrable forests has theatric art sought out a
place and built herself a temple? And I am journeying to her festivities!"
"You will wonder more," said the other, "when you learn by whom the piece is to be played. There is in the place
a large manufactory which employs many people. The proprietor, who lives, so to speak, remote from all human
society, can find no better means of entertaining his workmen during winter, than allowing them to act plays. He
suffers no cards among them; and wishes also to withdraw them from all coarse rustic practices. Thus they pass
the long evenings; and to−day, being the old gentleman's birthday, they are giving a particular festival in honour
of him."
Wilhelm came to Hochdorf, where he was to pass the night; and alighted at the manufactory, the proprietor of
which stood as a debtor in his list.
When he gave his name, the old man cried in a glad surprise: "Ay, sir, are you the son of that worthy man to
whom I owe so many thanks; so long have owed money? Your good father has had so much patience with me, I
should be a knave if I did not pay you speedily and cheerfully. You come at the proper time to see that I am fully
in earnest about it."
He then called out his wife, who seemed no less delighted than himself to see the youth: she declared that he was
very like his father; and lamented that, having such a multitude of guests already in the house, she could not lodge
him for the night.
The account was clear, and quickly settled; Wilhelm put the roll of gold into his pocket, and wished that all his
other business might go on as smoothly. At last the play−hour came: they now waited nothing but the coming of
the Head Forester, who at length also arrived; entered with a few hunters, and was received with the greatest
reverence.
The company was then led into the playhouse, formed out of a barn that lay close upon the garden. Without any
extraordinary taste, both seats and stage were yet decked out in a cheerful and pretty way. One of the painters
employed in the manufactory had formerly worked as an understrapper at the Prince's theatre; he had now
represented woods, and streets, and chambers, somewhat rudely it is true, yet so as to be recognised for such. The
piece itself they had borrowed from a strolling company, and shaped it aright according to their own ideas. As it
was, it did not fail to yield some entertainment. The plot of two lovers wishing to carry off a girl from her
guardian, and mutually from one another, produced a great variety of interesting situations. Being the first play
our friend had witnessed for so long a time, it suggested several reflections to him. It was full of action, but
without any true delineation of character. It pleased and delighted. Such are always the beginnings of the scenic
art. The rude man is contented if he see but something going on, the man of more refinement must be made to
feel, the man entirely refined desires to reflect.
The players he would willingly have helped here and there: for a very little would have made them greatly better.
Chapter III

45

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
His silent meditations were somewhat broken in upon by the tobacco−smoke, which now began to rise in great
and greater copiousness. Soon after the commencement of the piece, the Head Forester had lit his pipe; by and by,
others took the same liberty. The large dogs, too, which followed these gentlemen, introduced themselves in no
pleasant style. At first they had been bolted out; but soon finding the backdoor passage, they entered on the stage;
ran against the actors; and at last, jumping over the orchestra, joined their masters, who had taken up the front
seats in the pit.
For afterpiece an opera was given. A portrait, representing the old gentleman in his bridegroom dress, stood upon
an altar, hung with garlands. All the players paid their reverence to it in the most submissive postures. The
youngest child came forward dressed in white, and made a speech in verse; by which the whole family, and even
the Head Forester himself, whom it brought in mind of his own children, were melted into tears. So ended the
piece; and Wilhelm could not help stepping on the stage, to have a closer view of the actresses, to praise them for
their good performance, and give them a little counsel for the future.
The remaining business, which our friend in the following days had to transact in various quarters of the
hill−country, was not all so pleasant, or so easy to conclude with satisfaction. Many of his creditors entreated for
delay, many were uncourteous, many lied. In conformity with his instructions, he had some of them to sue at law;
he was thus obliged to seek out advocates, and give instructions to them, to appear before judges, and to go
through many other sorry duties of the same sort.
His case was hardly bettered, when people chanced to incline showing some attentions to him. He found very few
that could in any way instruct him; few with whom he could hope to establish a useful commercial
correspondence. Unhappily, moreover, the weather now grew rainy, and travelling on horseback in this district
came to be attended with insufferable difficulties. He therefore thanked his stars on again getting near the level
country; and at the foot of the mountains, looking out into a fertile and beautiful plain, intersected by a
smooth−flowing river, and seeing a cheerful little town lying on its banks all glittering in the sunshine, he
resolved, though without any special business in the place, to pass a day or two there, that he might refresh both
himself and his horse, which the bad roads had considerably injured.

Chapter IV
ON alighting at an inn, upon the market−place, he found matters going on very joyously, at least very stirringly. A
great company of rope−dancers, leapers and jugglers, having a Strong Man along with them, had just arrived with
their wives and children; and while preparing for a grand exhibition, they kept up a perpetual racket. They first
quarrelled with the landlord; then with one another; and if their contention was intolerable, the expressions of
their satisfaction were infinitely more so. Undetermined whether he should go or stay, he was standing in the
door, looking at some workmen who had just begun to erect a stage in the middle of the square.
A girl, with roses and other flowers for sale, coming by, held out her basket to him, and he purchased a beautiful
nosegay; which, like one that had a taste for these things, he tied up in a different fashion, and was looking at it
with a satisfied air, when the window of another inn on the opposite side of the square flew up, and a handsome
young lady looked out from it. Notwithstanding the distance, he observed that her face was animated by a
pleasant cheerfulness: her fair hair fell carelessly streaming about her neck; she seemed to be looking at the
stranger. In a short time afterwards, a boy with a white jacket, and a barber's apron on, came out from the door of
her house, towards Wilhelm; saluted him, and said: "The lady at the window bids me ask if you will not favour
her with a share of your beautiful flowers."−"They are all at her service," answered Wilhelm, giving the nosegay
to this nimble messenger, and making a bow to the fair one, which she returned with a friendly courtesy, and then
withdrew from the window.
Amused with this small adventure, he was going up−stairs to his chamber, when a young creature sprang against
Chapter IV

46

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
him, and attracted his attention. A short silk waistcoat with slashed Spanish sleeves, tight trousers with puffs,
looked very pretty on the child. Its long black hair was curled, and wound in locks and plaits about the head. He
looked at the figure with astonishment, and could not determine whether to take it for a boy or a girl. However, he
decided for the latter; and as the child ran by, he took her up in his arms, bade her good−day, and asked her to
whom she belonged, though he easily perceived that she must be a member of the vaulting and dancing company
lately arrived. She viewed him with a dark sharp side−look, as she pushed herself out of his arms, and ran into the
kitchen without making any answer.
On coming up−stairs, he found in the large parlour two men practising the small sword, or seeming rather to make
trial which was the better fencer. One of them plainly enough belonged to the vaulting company, the other had a
somewhat less savage aspect. Wilhelm looked at them, and had reason to admire them both; and as the
black−bearded, sturdy contender soon afterwards forsook the place of action, the other with extreme
complaisance offered Wilhelm the rapier.
"If you want to take a scholar under your inspection," said our friend, "I am well content to risk a few passes with
you."
Accordingly they fought together; and although the stranger greatly over−matched his new competitor, he politely
kept declaring that it all depended up practice; in fact, Wilhelm, inferior as he was, had made it evident that he
had got his first instructions from a good, solid, thoroughpaced German fencing−master.
Their entertainment was disturbed by the uproar with which the parti−coloured brotherhood issued from the inn,
to make proclamation of the show, and awaken a desire to see their art, throughout the town. Preceded by a drum,
the manager advanced on horseback; he was followed by a female dancer mounted on a corresponding hack, and
holding a child before her, all bedizened with ribbons and spangles. Next came the remainder of the troop on foot;
some of them carrying children on their shoulders in dangerous postures, yet smoothly and lightly; among these
the young, dark, black−haired figure again attracted Wilhelm's notice.
Pickleherring ran gaily up and down the crowding multitude, distributing his hand−bills with much practical fun;
here smacking the lips of a girl, there breeching a boy, and awakening generally among the people an invincible
desire to know more of him.
On the painted flags, the manifold science of the company was visibly delineated; particularly of a Monsieur
Narciss and the Demoiselle Landrinette; both of whom, being main characters, had prudently kept back from the
procession, thereby to acquire a more dignified consideration, and excite a greater curiosity.
During the procession, Wilhelm's fair neighbour had again appeared at the window; and he did not fail to inquire
about her of his new companion. This person, whom, for the present, we shall call Laertes, offered to take
Wilhelm over and introduce him. "I and the lady," said he, laughing, "are two fragments of an acting company
that made shipwreck here a short while ago. The pleasantness of the place has induced us to stay in it, and
consume our little stock of cash in peace, while one of our friends is out seeking some situation for himself and
us."
Laertes immediately accompanied his new acquaintance to Philina's door; where he left him for a moment, and
ran to a shop hard by for a few sweetmeats. "I am sure you will thank me," said he on returning, "for procuring
you so pleasant an acquaintance."
The lady came out from her room in a pair of tight little slippers with high heels, to give them welcome. She had
thrown a black mantle over her, above a white négligé, not indeed superstitiously clean, but which, for that very
reason, gave her a more frank and domestic air. Her short dress did not hide a pair of the prettiest feet and ankles
in the world.
Chapter IV

47

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
"You are welcome," she cried to Wilhelm, "and I thank you for your charming flowers." She led him into her
chamber with the one hand, pressing the nosegay to her breast with the other. Being all seated, and got into a
pleasant train of general talk, to which she had the art of giving a delightful turn, Laertes threw a handful of
gingerbread−nuts into her lap, and she immediately began to eat them.
"Look what a child this young gallant is!" she said: "he wants to persuade you that I am fond of such
confectionery; and it is himself that cannot live without licking his lips over something of the kind."
"Let us confess," replied Laertes, "that in this point, as in others, you and I go hand in hand. For example," he
continued, "the weather is delightful today: what if we should take a drive into the country, and eat our dinner at
the Mill?"
"With all my heart," said Philina; "we must give our new acquaintance some diversion."
Laertes sprang out, for he never walked; and Wilhelm motioned to return for a minute to his lodgings, to have his
hair put in order; for at present it was all dishevelled with riding. "You can do it here!" she said; then called her
little servant, and constrained Wilhelm in the politest manner to lay off his coat, to throw her powder−mantle over
him, and to have his head dressed in her presence. "We must lose no time," said she: "who knows how short a
while we may all be together?"
The boy, out of sulkiness and ill−nature more than want of skill, went on but indifferently with his task; he pulled
the hair with his implements, and seemed as if he would not soon be done. Philina more than once reproved him
for his blunders, and at last sharply packed him off, and chased him to the door. She then undertook the business
herself, and frizzled Wilhelm's locks with great dexterity and grace; though she too appeared to be in no
exceeding haste, but found always this and that to improve and put to rights; while at the same time she could not
help touching his knees with hers, and holding her nosegay and bosom so near his lips that he was strongly
tempted more than once to imprint a kiss on it.
When Wilhelm had cleaned his brow with a little powder−knife, she said to him: "Put it in your pocket, and think
of me when you see it." It was a pretty knife; the haft, of inlaid steel, had these friendly words wrought on it,
Think of me. Wilhelm put it up, and thanked her, begging permission at the same time to make her a little present
in return.
At last they were in readiness. Laertes had brought round the coach, and they commenced a very gay excursion.
To every beggar Philina threw out money from the window, giving along with it a merry and friendly word.
Scarcely had they reached the Mill, and ordered dinner, when a strain of music struck up before the house. It was
some miners singing various pretty songs, and accompanying their clear and shrill voices with a cithern and
triangle. In a short while the gathering crowd had formed a ring about them; and our company nodded
approbation to them from the windows. Observing this attention, they expanded their circle, and seemed making
preparation for their grandest piece. After some pause, a miner stepped forward with a mattock in his hand; and
while the others played a serious tune, he set himself to represent the action of digging.
Ere long a peasant came from among the crowd, and by pantomimic threats let the former know that he must
cease and remove. Our company were greatly surprised at this; they did not discover that the peasant was a miner
in disguise; till he opened his mouth, and in a sort of recitative, rebuked the other for daring to meddle with his
field. The latter did not lose his composure of mind, but began to inform the husbandman about his right to break
ground there, giving him withal some primary conceptions of mineralogy. The peasant not being master of his
foreign terminology, asked all manner of silly questions; whereat the spectators, as themselves more knowing, set
up many a hearty laugh. The miner endeavoured to instruct him; and showed him the advantage which, in the
long−run, would reach even him, if the deep−lying treasures of the land were dug out from their secret beds. The
Chapter IV

48

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
peasant, who at first had threatened his instructor with blows, was gradually pacified, and they parted good
friends at last; though it was the minor chiefly that got out of this contention with honour.
"In this little dialogue," said Wilhelm, when seated at table, "we have a lively proof how useful the theatre might
be to all ranks; what advantage even the State might procure from it, if the occupations, trades and undertakings
of men were brought upon the stage; and presented on their praiseworthy side, in that point of view in which the
State itself should honour and protect them. As matters stand, we exhibit only the ridiculous side of men; the
comic poet is, as it were, but a spiteful tax−gatherer, who keeps a watchful eye over the errors of his
fellow−subjects, and seems gratified when he can fix any charge upon them. Might it not be a worthy and
pleasing task for a statesman to survey the natural and reciprocal influence of all classes on each other, and to
guide some poet, gifted with sufficient humour, in such labours as these? In this way, I am persuaded, many very
entertaining, both agreeable and useful pieces, might be executed."
"So far," said Laertes, "as I, in wandering about the world, have been able to observe, statesmen are accustomed
merely to forbid, to hinder, to refuse; but very rarely to invite, to further, to reward. They let all things go along,
till some mischief happens; then they get into a rage, and lay about them."
"A truce with state and statesmen!" said Philina; "I cannot form a notion of statesmen except in periwigs; and a
periwig, wear it who will, always gives my fingers a spasmodic motion; I could like to pluck it off the venerable
gentleman, to skip up and down the room with it, and laugh at the baldhead."
So, with a few lively songs, which she could sing very beautifully, Philina cut short their conversation; and urged
them to a quick return homewards, that they might arrive in time for seeing the performance of the rope−dancers
in the evening.
On the road back she continued her lavish generosity, in a style of gaiety reaching to extravagance; for, at last,
every coin belonging to herself or her companions being spent, she threw her straw−hat from the window to a girl,
and her neckerchief to an old woman, who asked her for alms.
Philina invited both of her attendants to her own apartments; because, she said, the spectacle could be seen more
conveniently from her windows than from theirs.
On arriving, they found the stage set up, and the background decked with suspended carpets. The swing−boards
were already fastened, the slack−rope fixed to posts, the tight−rope bound over trestles. The square was
moderately filled with people, and the windows with spectators of some quality.
Pickleherring, with a few inspidities, at which the lookers−on are generally kind enough to laugh, first prepared
the meeting to attention and good humour. Some children, whose bodies were made to exhibit the strangest
contortions, awakened astonishment or horror; and Wilhelm could not, without the deepest sympathy, see the
child he had at the first glance felt an interest in, go through her fantastic positions with considerable difficulty.
But the merry tumblers soon changed the feeling into that of lively satisfaction, when they first singly, then in
rows, and at last all together, vaulted up into the air, making somersets backwards and forwards. A loud clapping
of hands and a strong huzza echoed from the whole assembly.
The general attention was next directed to quite a different object. The children in succession had to mount the
rope; the learners first, that by practising they might prolong the spectacle, and show the difficulties of the art
more clearly. Some men and full−grown women likewise exhibited their skill to moderate advantage; but still
there was no Monsieur Narciss, no Demoiselle Landrinette.
At last this worthy pair came forth; they issued from a kind of tent with red spread curtains; and, by their
agreeable forms and glittering decorations, fulfilled the hitherto increasing hopes of the spectators. He, a hearty
Chapter IV

knave, of middle stature, with black eyes and a strong head of hair; she, formed with not inferior symmetry,
exhibited themselves successively upon the rope, with delicate movements, leaping, and singular postures. Her
airy lightness; his audacity; the exactitude with which they both performed their feats of art, raised the universal
satisfaction higher at every step and spring. The stateliness with which they bore themselves, the seeming
attentions of the rest to them, gave them the appearance of king and queen of the whole troop, and all held them
worthy of the rank.
The animation of the people extended itself to the spectators at the windows; the ladies looked incessantly at
Narciss, the gentlemen at Landrinette. The populace hurraed, the more cultivated public could not keep from
clapping of the hands; Pickleherring now could scarcely raise a laugh. A few, however, slunk away, when some
members of the troop began to press through the crowd with their tin plates to collect money.
"They have made their purpose good, I imagine," said Wilhelm to Philina, who was leaning over the window
beside him. "I admire the ingenuity with which they have turned to advantage even the meanest parts of their
performance; out of the unskilfulness of their children, and exquisiteness of their chief actors, they have made up
a whole which at first excited our attention, and then gave us very fine entertainment."
The people by degrees dispersed, and the square was again become empty, while Philina and Laertes were
disputing about the forms and the skill of Narciss and Landrinette, and rallying each other on the subject at great
length. Wilhelm noticed the wonderful child standing on the street near some other children at play; he showed
her to Philina, who, in her lively way, immediately called and beckoned to the little one, and, this not succeeding,
tripped singing down stairs, and led her up by the hand.
"Here is the enigma," said she, as she brought her to the door. The child stood upon the threshold, as if she meant
again to run off; laid her right hand on her breast, the left on her brow, and bowed deeply. "Fear nothing, my little
dear," said Wilhelm, rising and going towards her. She viewed him with a doubting look, and came a few steps
nearer.
"What is thy name?" he asked. "They call me Mignon." "How old art thou?" "No one has counted." "Who was thy
father?" "The Great Devil is dead."
"Well! this is singular enough," said Philina. They asked her a few more questions; she gave her answers in a kind
of broken German, and with a strangely solemn manner, every time laying her hands on her breast and brow, and
bowing deeply.
Wilhelm could not satisfy himself with looking at her. His eyes and his heart were irresistibly attracted by the
mysterious condition of this being. He reckoned her about twelve or thirteen years of age; her body was well
formed, only her limbs gave promise of a stronger growth, or else announced a stunted one. Her countenance was
not regular, but striking; her brow full of mystery; her nose extremely beautiful; her mouth, although it seemed
too closely shut for one of her age, and though she often threw it to a side, had yet an air of frankness, and was
very lovely. Her brownish complexion could scarcely be discerned through the paint. This form stamped itself
deeply in Wilhelm's soul; he kept looking at her earnestly, and forgot the present scene in the multitude of his
reflections. Philina waked him from his half−dream, by holding out the remainder of her sweetmeats to the child,
and giving her a sign to go away. She made her little bow as formerly, and darted like lightning through the door.
As the time drew on when our new friends had to part for the evening, they planned a fresh excursion for the
morrow. They purposed now to have their dinner at a neighbouring Jägerhaus. Before taking leave of Laertes,
Wilhelm said many things in Philina's praise, to which the other made only brief and careless answers.
Next morning, having once more exercised themselves in fencing for an hour, they went over to Philina's lodging,
towards which they had seen their expected coach passing by. But how surprised was Wilhelm, when the coach
Chapter IV

50

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
seemed altogether to have vanished; and how much more so, when Philina was not to be found at home! She had
placed herself in the carriage, they were told, with a couple of strangers who had come that morning, and was
gone with them. Wilhelm had been promising himself some pleasant entertainment from her company, and could
not hide his irritation. Laertes, on the other hand, but laughed at it, and cried: "I love her for this: it looks so like
herself! Let us, however, go directly to the Jägerhaus: be Philina where she pleases, we will not lose our
promenade on her account."
As Wilhelm, while they walked, continued censuring the inconsistency of such conduct, Laertes said: "I cannot
reckon it inconsistent so long as one keeps faithful to his character. If this Philina plans you anything, or promises
you anything, she does it under the tacit condition that it shall be quite convenient for her to fulfil her plan, to
keep her promise. She gives willingly; but you must ever hold yourself in readiness to return her gifts."
"That seems a singular character," said Wilhelm.
"Anything but singular; only she is not a hypocrite. I like her on that account. Yes, I am her friend, because she
represents the sex so truly, which I have so much cause to hate. To me she is another genuine Eve, the great
mother of womankind; so are they all, only they will not all confess it."
With abundance of such talk, in which Laertes very vehemently exhibited his spleen against the fair sex, without,
however, giving any cause for it, they arrived at the forest; into which Wilhelm entered in no joyful mood, the
speeches of Laertes having again revived in him the memory of his relation to Mariana. Not far from a shady
well, among some old and noble trees, they found Philina sitting by herself at a stone table. Seeing them, she
struck up a merry song; and, when Laertes asked for her companions, she cried out: "I have already cozened them,
I have already had my laugh at them, and sent them a−travelling, as they deserved. By the way hither I had put to
proof their liberality; and finding that they were a couple of your close−fisted gentry, I immediately determined to
have amends of them. On arriving at the inn, they asked the waiter what was to be had. He, with his customary
glibness of tongue, reckoned over all that could be found in the house, and more than could be found. I noticed
their perplexity; they looked at one another, stammered, and inquired about the cost. 'What is the use of all this
studying?' said I; 'the table is the lady's business, allow me to manage it.' I immediately began ordering a most
unconscionable dinner; for which many necessary articles would require to be sent for from the neighbourhood.
The waiter, of whom, by a wry mouth or two, I had made a confidant, at last helped me out; and so, by the image
of a sumptuous feast, we tortured them to such a degree that they fairly determined on having a walk in the forest,
from which I imagine we shall look with clear eyes if we see them come back. I have laughed a quarter of an hour
for my own behoof; I shall laugh forever when I think of the looks they had." At table, Laertes told of similar
adventures: they got into the track of recounting ludicrous stories, mistakes and dextrous cheats.
A young man, of their acquaintance from the town, came gliding through the wood with a book in his hand; he sat
down by them, and began praising the beauty of the place. He directed their attention to the murmuring of the
brook, to the waving of the boughs, to the checkered lights and shadows, and the music of the birds. Philina
commenced a little song of the cuckoo, which did not seem at all to exhilarate the man of taste: he very soon
made his compliments and went on.
"O that I might never hear more of nature, and scenes of nature!" cried Philina so soon as he was gone: "there is
nothing in the world more intolerable than to hear people reckon up the pleasures you enjoy. When the day is
bright you go to walk, as to dance when you hear a tune played. But who would think a moment on the music or
the weather? It is the dancer that interests us, not the violin; and to look upon a pair of bright black eyes is the life
of a pair of blue ones. But what on earth have we to do with wells, and brooks, and old rotten lindens?" She was
sitting opposite to Wilhelm; and while speaking so, she looked into his eyes with a glance which he could not
hinder from piercing at least to the very door of his heart.

Chapter IV

"You are right," replied he, not without embarrassment; "man is ever the most interesting object to man, and
perhaps should be the only one that interests. Whatever else surrounds us is but the element in which we live, or
else the instrument which we employ. The more we devote ourselves to such things, the more we attend to and
feel concern in them, the weaker will our sense of our own dignity become, the weaker our feelings for society.
Men who put a great value on gardens, buildings, clothes, ornaments, or any other sort of property, grow less
social and pleasant; they lose sight of their brethren, whom very few can succeed in collecting about them and
entertaining. Have you not observed it on the stage? A good actor makes us very soon forget the awkwardness
and meanness of paltry decorations; but a splendid theatre is the very thing which first makes us truly feel the
want of proper actors."
After dinner Philina sat down among the long overshaded grass, and commanded both her friends to fetch her
flowers in great quantities. She wreathed a complete garland, and put it round her head: it made her look
extremely charming. The flowers were still sufficient for another; this too she plaited, while both the young men
sat beside her. When at last, amid infinite mirth and sportfulness, it was completed, she pressed it on Wilhelm's
head with the greatest dignity, and shifted the posture of it more than once till it seemed to her properly adjusted.
"And I, it appears, must go empty," said Laertes.
"Not by any means; you shall not have reason to complain," replied Philina, taking off the garland from her own
head, and putting it on his.
"If we were rivals," said Laertes, "we might now dispute very warmly which of us stood higher in thy favour."
"And the more fools you," said she, while she bent herself towards him, and offered him her lips to kiss; and then
immediately turned round, threw her arm about Wilhelm, and bestowed a kind salute on him also. "Which of
them tastes best?" said she archly.
"Surprisingly!" exclaimed Laertes: "it seems as if nothing else had ever such a tang of wormwood in it."
"As little wormwood," she replied, "as any gift that a man may enjoy without envy and without conceit. But
now," cried she, "I should like to have an hour's dancing, and after that we must look to our vaulters."
Accordingly they went into the house, and there found music in readiness. Philina was a beautiful dancer, she
animated both her companions. Nor was Wilhelm without skill; but he wanted careful practice, a defect which his
two friends voluntarily took charge of remedying.
In these amusements the time passed on insensibly; it was already late when they returned. The rope−dancers had
commenced their operations. A multitude of people had again assembled in the square; and our friends, on
alighting, were struck by the appearance of a tumult in the crowd, occasioned by a throng of men rushing towards
the door of the inn, which Wilhelm had now turned his face to. He sprang forward to see what it was; and
pressing through the people, he was struck with horror to observe the master of the rope−dancing company
dragging poor Mignon by the hair out of the house, and unmercifully beating her little body with the handle of a
whip.
Wilhelm darted on the man like lightning, and seized him by the collar. "Quit the child!" he cried in a furious
tone, "or one of us shall never leave this spot;" and so speaking, he grasped the fellow by the throat with a force
which only rage could have lent him. The showman, on the point of choking, let go the child, and endeavoured to
defend himself against his new assailant. But some people, who had felt compassion for Mignon, yet had not
dared to begin a quarrel for her, now laid hold of the rope−dancer, wrenched his whip away, and threatened him
with great fierceness and abuse. Being now reduced to the weapons of his mouth, he began bullying and cursing
horribly: the lazy, worthless urchin, he said, would not do her duty; refused to perform the egg−dance, which he
had promised to the public; he would beat her to death, and no one should hinder him. He tried to get loose, and
Chapter IV

52

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
seek the child, who had crept away among the crowd. Wilhelm held him back, and said sternly: "You shall neither
see nor touch her, till you have explained before a magistrate where you stole her. I will pursue you to every
extremity; you shall not escape me." These words, which Wilhelm uttered in heat, without thought or purpose, out
of some vague feeling, or, if you will, out of inspiration, soon brought the raging showman to composure. "What
have I to do with the useless brat?" cried he. "Pay me what her clothes cost, and make of her what you please; we
shall settle it tonight." And, being liberated, he made haste to resume his interrupted operations, and to calm the
irritation of the public by some striking displays of his craft.
So soon as all was still again, Wilhelm commenced a search for Mignon, whom, however, he could nowhere find.
Some said they had seen her on the street, others on the roofs of the adjoining houses, but, after seeking
unsuccessfully in all quarters, he was forced to content himself, and wait to see if she would not again turn up of
herself.
In the mean time, Narciss had come into the house, and Wilhelm set to question him about the birth−place and
history of the child. Monsieur Narciss knew nothing about these things; for he had not long been in the company:
but in return he recited, with much volubility and levity, various particulars of his own fortune. Upon Wilhelm's
wishing him joy of the great approbation he had gained, Narciss expressed himself as if exceedingly indifferent
on that point. "People laugh at us," he said, "and admire our feats of skill; but their admiration does nothing for us.
The master has to pay us, and may raise the funds where he pleases." He then took his leave, and was setting off
in great haste.
At the question, Whither he was bent so fast? the dog gave a smile, and admitted that his figure and talents had
acquired for him a more solid species of favour than the huzzaing of the multitude. He had been invited by some
young ladies, who desired much to become acquainted with him, and he was afraid it would be midnight before
he could get all his visits over. He proceeded with the greatest candour to detail his adventures; he would have
given the names of his patronesses, their streets and houses, had not Wilhelm waived such indiscretion, and
politely dismissed him.
Laertes had meanwhile been entertaining Landrinette: he declared that she was fully worthy to be and to remain a
woman.
Our friend next proceeded to his bargain with the showman for Mignon. Thirty crowns was the price set upon her;
and for this sum the black−bearded hot Italian entirely surrendered all his claims: but of her history, or parentage,
he would discover nothing; only that she had fallen into his hands at the death of his brother, who, by reason of
his admirable skill, had usually been named the Great Devil.
Next morning was chiefly spent in searching for the child. It was in vain that they rummaged every hole and
corner of the house and neighbourhood: the child had vanished, and Wilhelm was afraid she might have leapt into
some pool of water, or destroyed herself in some other way.
Philina's charms could not dissipate his inquietude; he passed a dreary thoughtful day. Nor at evening could the
utmost efforts of the tumblers and dancers, exerting all their powers to gratify the public, divert the current of his
thoughts, or clear away the clouds from his mind.
By the concourse of people flocking from all places round, the numbers had greatly increased on this occasion;
the general approbation was like a snowball rolling itself into a monstrous size. The feat of leaping over swords,
and through the cask with paper ends, made a great sensation. The Strong Man, too, produced a universal feeling
of mingled astonishment and horror, when he laid his head and feet on a couple of separate stools, and then
allowed some sturdy smiths to place a stithy on the unsupported part of his body, and hammer a horse−shoe till it
was completely made by means of it.

Chapter IV

53

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
The Hercules' Strength, as they called it, was a no less wonderful affair. A row of men stood up; then another row,
upon their shoulders; then women and young lads, supported in like manner on the second row; so that finally a
living pyramid was formed, the peak being ornamented by a child, placed on its head, and dressed out in the shape
of a ball and weathervane. Such a sight, never witnessed in those parts before, gave a worthy termination to the
whole performance. Narciss and Landrinette were then borne in litters, on the shoulders of the rest, along the chief
streets of the town, amid the triumphant shouts of the people. Ribbons, nosegays, silks, were thrown upon them;
all pressed to get a sight of them. Each thought himself happy if he could behold them, and be honoured with a
look of theirs.
"What actor, what author, nay what man of any class, would not regard himself as on the summit of his wishes,
could he, by a noble saying or a worthy action, produce so universal an impression? What a precious emotion
would it give, if one could disseminate generous, exalted, manly feelings with electric force and speed, and rouse
assembled thousands into such rapture, as these people, by their bodily alertness, have done! If one could
communicate to thronging multitudes a fellow−feeling in all that belongs to man, by the portraying of happiness
and misery, of wisdom and folly, nay of absurdity and silliness; could kindle and thrill their inmost souls, and set
their stagnant nature into movement, free, vehement and pure!" So said our friend; and as neither Laertes nor
Philina showed any disposition to take part in such a strain, he entertained himself with these darling speculations,
walking up and down the streets till late at night, and again pursuing, with all the force and vivacity of a liberated
imagination, his old desire to have all that was good and noble and great embodied and shown forth by the
theatric art.

Chapter V
NEXT morning, the rope−dancers, not without much parade and bustle, having gone away, Mignon immediately
appeared, and came into the parlour as Wilhelm and Laertes were busy fencing. "Where hast thou been hid?" said
Wilhelm in a friendly tone. "Thou hast given us a deal of anxiety." The child looked at him, and answered
nothing. "Thou art ours now," cried Laertes, "we have bought thee." "For how much?" inquired the child quite
coolly. "For a hundred ducats," said the other; "pay them again, and thou art free." "Is that very much?" she asked.
"O yes! thou must now be a good child." "I will try," she said.
From that moment she observed strictly what services the waiter had to do for both her friends: and after next day,
she would not any more let him enter the room. She persisted in doing everything herself; and accordingly went
through her duties, slowly indeed, and sometimes awkwardly, yet completely and with the greatest care.
She was frequently observed going to a basin of water, and washing her face with such diligence and violence,
that she almost wore the skin from her cheeks; till Laertes, by dint of questions and reproofs, learned that she was
striving by all means to get the paint from her skin; and that, in her zealous endeavours towards this object, she
had mistaken the redness produced by rubbing for the most obdurate dye. They set her right on this point, and she
ceased her efforts; after which, having come again to her natural state, she exhibited a fine brown complexion,
beautiful, though sparingly intermingled with red.
The siren charms of Philina, the mysterious presence of the child, produced more impression on our friend than he
liked to confess; he passed several days in that strange society, endeavouring to elude self−reproaches by a
diligent practice of fencing and dancing, accomplishments which he believed might not again be put within his
reach so conveniently.
It was with great surprise, and not without a certain satisfaction, that he one day observed Herr Melina and his
wife alight at the inn. After the first glad salutation, they inquired about "the lady−manager and the other actors;"
and learned, with astonishment and terror, that the lady−manager had long since gone away, and her actors, to a
very few, dispersed themselves about the country.
Chapter V

54

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
This couple, subsequently to their marriage, in which, as we know, our friend did his best to serve them, had been
travelling about in various quarters, seeking an engagement, without finding any; and had at last been directed to
this little town by some persons who met them on their journey, and said there was a good theatre in the place.
Melina by no means pleased the lively Laertes, when introduced to him, any more than his wife did Philina. Both
heartily wished to be rid of these new−comers; and Wilhelm could inspire them with no favourable feelings on
the subject, though he more than once assured them that the Melinas were very worthy people.
Indeed, the previous merry life of our three adventurers was interfered with by this extension of their society, in
more ways than one. Melina had taken up his quarters in the inn where Philina stayed, and he very soon began a
system of cheapening and higgling. He would have better lodging, more sumptuous diet, and readier attendance,
for a smaller charge. In a short while the landlord and waiter showed very rueful looks! for whereas the others, to
get pleasantly along, had expressed no discontent with anything, and paid instantly, that they might avoid thinking
longer of payment, Melina now insisted on regulating every meal, and investigating its contents beforehand; a
species of service for which Philina named him, without scruple, a ruminating animal.
Yet more did the merry girl hate Melina's wife. Frau Melina was a young woman not without culture, but wofully
defective in soul and spirit. She could declaim not badly, and kept declaiming constantly; but it was easy to
observe that her performances were little more than recitations of words. She laboured a few detached passages,
but never could express the feeling of the whole. Withal, however, she was seldom disagreeable to any one,
especially to men. On the contrary, people who enjoyed her acquaintance commonly ascribed to her a fine
understanding; for she was what might be called a kind of spiritual chameleon, or taker−on. 6 Any friend whose
favour she had need of, she could flatter with peculiar adroitness; could give in to his ideas so long as she could
understand them; and, when they went beyond her own horizon, could hail with ecstasy such new and brilliant
visions. She understood well when to speak and when to keep silence; and though her disposition was not spiteful,
she could spy out with great expertness where another's weak side lay.

Chapter VI
MELINA, in the mean time, had been making strict inquiry about the wrecks of the late theatrical establishment.
The wardrobe, as well as decorations, had been pawned with some traders; and a notary had been empowered,
under certain conditions, to dispose of them by sale, should purchasers occur. Melina wished to see this ware; and
he took Wilhelm with him. No sooner was the room opened, than our friend felt towards its contents a kind of
inclination, which he would not confess to himself. Sad as was the state of the blotched and tarnished decorations;
little showy as the Turkish and Pagan garments, the old farcecoats for men and women, the cowls for enchanters,
priests and Jews, might be, he was not able to exclude the feeling, that the happiest moments of his life had been
spent in a similar magazine of frippery. Could Melina have seen into his heart, he would have urged him more
pressingly to lay out a sum of money in liberating these scattered fragments, in furbishing them up, and again
combining them into a beautiful whole. "What a happy man could I be," cried Melina, "had I but two hundred
crowns, to get into my hands, for a beginning, these fundamental necessaries of a theatre! How soon should I get
up a little playhouse, that would draw contributions from the town and neighborhood, and maintain us all!"
Wilhelm was silent. They left these treasures of the stage to be again locked up, and both went away in a
reflective mood.
Thenceforth Melina talked of nothing else but projects and plans for setting up a theatre, and gaining profit by it.
He tried to interest Philina and Laertes in his schemes; and proposals were made to Wilhelm about advancing
money, and taking them as his security. On this occasion, Wilhelm first clearly perceived that he was lingering
too long here: he excused himself, and set about making preparations for departure.
In the mean time, Mignon's form and manner of existence was growing more attractive to him every day. In her
Chapter VI

55

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
whole system of proceedings there was something very singular. She never walked up or down the stairs, but
jumped. She would spring along by the railing, and before you were aware, would be sitting quietly above on the
landing. Wilhelm had observed, also, that she had a different sort of salutation for each individual. For himself, it
had of late been with her arms crossed upon her breast. Often for the whole day she was mute. At times she
answered various questions more freely, yet always strangely; so that you could not determine whether it was
caused by shrewd sense, or ignorance of the language; for she spoke in broken German, interlaced with French
and Italian. In Wilhelm's service she was indefatigable, and up before the sun. On the other hand, she vanished
early in the evening, went to sleep in a little room upon the bare floor, and could not by any means be induced to
take a bed or even a palliasse. He often found her washing herself. Her clothes, too, were kept scrupulously clean,
though nearly all about her was quilted two or three plies thick. Wilhelm was moreover told, that she went every
morning early to hear mass. He followed her on one occasion, and saw her kneeling down with a rosary in a
corner of the church, and praying devoutly. She did not observe him; and he returned home, forming many a
conjecture about this appearance, yet unable to arrive at any probable conclusion.
A new application from Melina for a sum of money to redeem the often−mentioned stage−apparatus, caused
Wilhelm to think more seriously than ever about setting off. He proposed writing to his people, who for a long
time had heard no tidings of him, by the very earliest post. He accordingly commenced a letter to Werner; and had
advanced a considerable way with the history of his adventures, in recounting which he had more than once
unintentionally swerved a little from the truth, when, to his vexation and surprise, he observed, upon the back of
his sheet, some verses which he had been copying from his album for Madam Melina. Out of humour at this
mistake, he tore the paper in pieces, and put off repeating his confession till the next post−day.

Chapter VII
OUR party was now again collected; and Philina, who always kept a sharp look−out on every horse or carriage
that passed by, exclaimed, with great eagerness: "Our Pedant! Here comes our dearest Pedant! Who the deuce is it
he has with him?" Speaking thus, she beckoned at the window, and the vehicle drew up.
A woful−looking genius, whom, by his shabby coat of grayish brown, and his ill−conditioned lower garments,
you must have taken for some unprosperous preceptor, of the sort that moulder in our universities, now descended
from the carriage, and, taking off his hat to salute Philina, discovered an ill−powdered but yet very stiff periwig,
while Philina threw a hundred kisses of the hand towards him. As Philina's chief enjoyment lay in loving one
class of men, and being loved by them; so there was a second and hardly inferior satisfaction, wherewith she
entertained herself as frequently as possible; and this consisted in hoodwinking and passing jokes upon the other
class, whom at such moments she happened not to love; all which she could accomplish in a very sprightly style.
Amid the flourish which she made in receiving this old friend, no attention was bestowed upon the rest who
followed him. Yet among the party were an oldish man and two young girls, whom Wilhelm thought he knew.
Accordingly it turned out, that he had often seen them all, some years ago, in a company then playing in his native
town. The daughters had grown since that period; the old man was little altered. He commonly enacted those
good−hearted boisterous old gentlemen, whom the German theatre is never without, and whom, in common life,
one also frequently enough falls in with. For as it is the character of our countrymen to do good, and cause it,
without pomp or circumstance, so they seldom consider that there is likewise a mode of doing what is right with
grace and dignity; more frequently, indeed, they yield to the spirit of contradiction, and fall into the error of
deforming their dearest virtue by a surly mode of putting it in practice.
Such parts our actor could play very well; and he played them so often and exclusively, that he had himself taken
up the same turn of proceeding in his ordinary life.
On recognizing him, Wilhelm was seized with a strong commotion: he recollected how often he had seen this man
Chapter VII

56

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
on the stage with his beloved Mariana: he still heard him scolding, still heard the small soothing voice, with which
in many characters she had to meet his rugged temper.
The first anxious question put to the stranger, Whether they had heard of any situation in their travels? was
answered, alas, with No; and to complete the information, it was farther added, that all the companies they had
fallen in with were not only supplied with actors, but many of them were afraid lest, on account of the
approaching war, they should be forced to separate. Old Boisterous, with his daughters, moved by spleen and love
of change, had given up an advantageous engagement; then meeting with the Pedant by the way, they had hired a
carriage to come hither; where, as they found, good counsel was still dear, needful to have, and difficult to get.
The time while the rest were talking very keenly of their circumstances, Wilhelm spent in thought. He longed to
speak in private with the old man; he wished and feared to hear of Mariana, and felt himself in the greatest
disquietude.
The pretty looks of the stranger damsels could not call him from his dream; but a war of words which now arose,
awakened his attention. It was Friedrich, the fair−haired boy, who used to attend Philina, stubbornly refusing, on
this occasion, to cover the table and bring up dinner. "I engaged to serve you," he cried; "but not to wait on
everybody." They fell into a hot contest. Philina insisted that he should do his duty; and as he obstinately refused,
she told him plainly he might go about his business.
"You think, perhaps, I cannot leave you?" cried he, sturdily; then went to pack up his bundle, and soon hastily
quitted the house.
"Go, Mignon," said Philina, "and get us what we want: tell the waiter, and help him to attend us."
Mignon came before Wilhelm, and asked in her laconic way: "Shall I? May I?" To which Wilhelm answered: "Do
all that the lady bids thee, child."
She accordingly took charge of everything, and waited on the guests the whole evening, with the utmost
carefulness. After dinner, Wilhelm proposed to have a walk with the old man alone. Succeeding in this, after
many questions about his late wanderings, the conversation turned upon the former company, and Wilhelm
hazarded a question touching Mariana.
"Do not speak to me of that despicable creature," cried the old man; "I have sworn to think of her no more."
Terrified at this speech, Wilhelm felt still more embarrassed, as the old man proceeded to vituperate her fickleness
and wantonness. Most gladly would our friend have broken off the conversation; but now it was impossible: he
was obliged to undergo the whole tumultuous effusions of this strange old gentleman.
"I am ashamed," continued he, "that I felt such a friendship for her. Yet had you known the girl better, you would
excuse me. She was so pretty, so natural and good, so pleasing, in every sense so tolerable, I could never have
supposed that ingratitude and impudence were to prove the chief features of her character."
Wilhelm had nerved himself to hear the worst of her; when all at once he observed, with astonishment, that the
old man's tones grew milder, his voice faltered, and he took out his handkerchief to dry the tears, which at last
began to trickle down his cheeks.
"What is the matter with you?" cried Wilhelm. "What is it that suddenly so changes the current of your feelings?
Conceal it not from me. I take a deeper interest in the fate of this girl than you suppose. Only tell me all."
"I have not much to say," replied the old man, again taking up his earnest angry tone. "I have suffered more from
her than I shall ever forgive. She had always a kind of trust in me. I loved her as my own daughter; indeed, while
Chapter VII

57

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
my wife lived, I had formed a resolution to take the creature to my own house, and save her from the hands of that
old crone, from whose guidance I boded no good. But my wife died, and the project went to nothing.
"About the end of our stay in your native town, it is not quite three years ago, I noticed a visible sadness about
her. I questioned her, but she evaded me. At last we set out on our journey. She travelled in the same coach with
me; and I soon observed, what she herself did not long deny, that she was with child, and suffering the greatest
terror, lest our manager might turn her off. In fact, in a short while he did make the discovery; immediately threw
up her contract, which at any rate was only for six weeks; paid off her arrears; and in spite of all entreaties, left
her behind, in the miserable inn of a little village.
"Devil take all wanton jilts!" cried the old man, with a splenetic tone, "and especially this one, that has spoiled me
so many hours of my life! Why should I keep talking how I myself took charge of her, what I did for her, what I
spent on her, how in absence I provided for her? I would rather throw my purse into the ditch, and spend my time
in nursing mangy whelps, than ever more bestow the smallest care on such a thing. Pshaw! at first I got letters of
thanks, notice of places she was staying at; and, finally, no word at all, not even an acknowledgment for the
money I had sent to pay the expenses of her lying−in. O! the treachery and the fickleness of women are rightly
matched, to get a comfortable living for themselves, and to give an honest fellow many heavy hours."

Chapter VIII
WILHELM'S feelings, on returning home after this conversation, may be easily conceived. All his old wounds
had been torn up afresh; and the sentiment, that Mariana was not wholly unworthy of his love, had again been
brought to life. The interest which the old man had shown about her fate, the praises he gave her against his will,
displayed her again in all her attractiveness. Nay, even the bitter accusations brought against her contained
nothing that could lower her in Wilhelm's estimation; for he, as well as she, was guilty in all her aberrations; Nor
did even her final silence seem greatly blamable; it rather inspired him with mournful thoughts. He saw her, as a
frail, ill−succoured mother, wandering helplessly about the world; wandering perhaps with his own child. What
he knew, and what he knew not, awoke in him the painfulest emotions.
Mignon had been waiting for him; she lighted him upstairs. On setting down the light, she begged that he would
allow her, that evening, to compliment him with a piece of her art. He would rather have declined this,
particularly as he knew not what it was; but he had not the heart to refuse anything this kind creature wished.
After a little while she again came in. She carried a little carpet below her arm, which she then spread out upon
the floor. Wilhelm said she might proceed. She thereupon brought four candles, and placed one upon each corner
of the carpet. A little basket of eggs which she next carried in, made her purpose clearer. Carefully measuring her
steps, she then walked to and fro on the carpet, spreading out the eggs in certain figures and positions: which
done, she called in a man that was waiting in the house, and could play on the violin. He retired with his
instrument into a corner; she tied a band about her eyes, gave a signal, and, like a piece of wheel−work set
a−going, she began moving the same instant as the music, accompanying her beats and the notes of the tune with
the strokes of a pair of castanets.
Lightly, nimbly, quickly, and with hairbreadth accuracy, she carried on the dance. She skipped so sharply and
surely along between the eggs, and trod so closely down beside them, that you would have thought every instant
she must trample one of them in pieces, or kick the rest away in her rapid turns. By no means! She touched no one
of them, though winding herself through their mazes with all kinds of steps, wide and narrow, nay even with
leaps, and at last half−kneeling.
Constant as the movement of a clock, she ran her course; and the strange music, at each repetition of the tune,
gave a new impulse to the dance, recommencing and again rushing off as at first. Wilhelm was quite led away by
this singular spectacle; he forgot his cares; he followed every movement of the dear little creature, and felt
Chapter VIII

58

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
surprised to see how finely her character unfolded itself as she proceeded in the dance.
Rigid, sharp, cold, vehement and in soft postures, stately rather than attractive: such was the light in which it
showed her.
At this moment, he experienced at once all the emotions he had ever felt for Mignon. He longed to incorporate
this forsaken being with his own heart; to take her in his arms, and with a father's love to awaken in her the joy of
existence.
The dance being ended, she rolled eggs together softly with her foot into a little heap, left none behind, harmed
none; then placed herself beside it, taking the bandage from her eyes, and concluding her performance with a little
bow.
Wilhelm thanked her for having executed, so prettily and unexpectedly, a dance he had long wished to see. He
patted her; was sorry she had tired herself so much. He promised her a new suit of clothes; to which she
vehemently replied: "The colour!" This, too, he promised her, though not well knowing what she meant by it. She
then lifted up the eggs, took the carpet under her arm, asked if he wanted anything farther, and skipped out of the
door.
The musician, being questioned, said that, for some time, she had taken much trouble in often singing over the
tune of this dance, the well−known fandango, to him, and training him till he could play it accurately. For his
labour she had likewise offered him some money, which, however, he would not accept.

Chapter IX
AFTER a restless night, which our friend spent sometimes waking, sometimes oppressed with unpleasant dreams,
seeing Mariana now in all her beauty, now in woful case, at one time with a child on her arm, then soon bereaved
of it, the morning had scarcely dawned, when Mignon entered with a tailor. She brought some gray cloth and blue
taffeta, signifying in her own way that she wished to have a new jacket and sailor's trousers, such as she had seen
the boys of the town wearing, with blue cuffs and tyers.
Since the loss of Mariana, Wilhelm had laid aside all gay colours. He had used himself to gray, the garment of the
shades; and only perhaps a sky−blue lining, or little collar of that dye, in some degree enlivened his sober garb.
Mignon, eager to wear his colours, hurried on the tailor, who engaged to have his work soon ready.
The exercise in dancing and fencing, which our friend took this day with Laertes, did not prosper in their hands.
Indeed, it was soon interrupted by Melina, who came to show them circumstantially how a little company was
now of itself collected, sufficient to exhibit plays in abundance. He renewed the proposal that Wilhelm should
advance a little money for setting them in motion; which, however, Wilhelm still declined.
Ere long Philina and the girls came in, racketing and laughing as usual. They had now devised a fresh excursion;
for change of place and objects was a pleasure after which they always longed. To eat daily in a different spot was
their highest wish. On this occasion they proposed a sail.
The boat, in which they were to fall down the pleasant windings of the river, had already been engaged by the
Pedant. Philina urged them on: the party did not linger, and were soon on board.
"What shall we take to now?" said Philina, when all had placed themselves upon the benches.
"The readiest thing," replied Laertes, "were for us to extemporise a play. Let each take a part that suits his
Chapter IX

59

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
character, and we shall see how we get along."
"Excellent!" said Wilhelm. "In a society where there is no dissimulation, but where each without disguise pursues
the bent of his own humour, elegance and satisfaction cannot long continue; and where dissimulation always
reigns, they do not enter at all. It will not be amiss, then, that we take up dissimulation to begin with; and then,
behind our masks, be as candid as we please."
"Yes," said Laertes, "it is on this account that one goes on so pleasantly with women; they never show themselves
in their natural form."
"That is to say," replied Madam Melina, "they are not so vain as men, who conceive themselves to be always
amiable enough, just as nature has produced them."
In the mean time the river led them between pleasant groves and hills, between gardens and vineyards; and the
young women, especially Madam Melina, expressed their rapture at the landscape. The latter even began to recite,
in solemn style, a pretty poem of the descriptive sort, upon a similar scene of nature; but Philina interrupted her
with the proposal of a law, that no one should presume to speak of any inanimate object. On the other hand, she
zealously urged on their project of an extempore play. Old Boisterous was to be a half−pay officer; Laertes a
fencing−master taking his vacation; the Pedant a Jew; she herself would act a Tyrolese, leaving to the rest to
choose characters according to their several pleasures. They would suppose themselves to be a party of total
strangers to each other, who had just met on board a merchant ship.
She immediately began to play her part with the Jew; and a universal cheerfulness diffused itself among them.
They had not sailed far, when the skipper stopped in his course, asking permission of the company to take in a
person standing on the shore, who had made a sign to him.
"That is just what we needed," cried Philina; "a chance passenger was wanting to complete the travelling−party."
A handsome man came on board; whom, by his dress and his dignified mien, you might have taken for a
clergyman. He saluted the party, who thanked him in their own way, and soon made known to him the nature of
their game. The stranger immediately engaged to play the part of a country parson; which, in fact, he
accomplished in the adroitest manner, to the admiration of all; now admonishing, now telling stories, showing
some weak points, yet never losing their respect.
In the mean time, every one who had made a false step in his part, or swerved from his character, had been
obliged to forfeit a pledge; Philina had gathered them with the greatest care; and especially threatened the
reverend gentleman with many kisses, though he himself had never been at fault. Melina, on the other hand, was
completely fleeced; shirt−buttons, buckles, every movable about his person was in Philina's hands. He was trying
to enact an English traveller, and could not by any means get into the spirit of his part.
Meanwhile the time had passed away very pleasantly. Each had strained his fancy and his wit to the utmost, and
each had garnished his part with agreeable and entertaining jests.
Thus comfortably occupied, they reached the place where they meant to pass the day; and Wilhelm going out to
walk with the clergyman, as both from his appearance and late character he persisted in naming him, soon fell into
an interesting conversation.
"I think this practice," said the stranger, "very useful among actors, and even in the company of friends and
acquaintances. It is the best mode of drawing men out of themselves, and leading them, by a circuitous path, back
into themselves again. It should be a custom with every troop of players to practise in this manner; and the public
Chapter IX

60

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
would assuredly be no loser, if every month an unwritten piece were brought forward; in which, of course, the
players had prepared themselves by several rehearsals."
"One should not, then," replied our friend, "consider an extempore piece as, strictly speaking, composed on the
spur of the moment; but as a piece of which the plan, action and division of the scenes were given, the filling−up
of all this being left to the player."
"Quite right," said the stranger; "and in regard to this very filling−up, such a piece, were the players once trained
to these performances, would profit greatly. Not in regard to the mere words, it is true; for by a careful selection
of these, the studious writer may certainly adorn his work; but in regard to the gestures, looks, exclamations, and
everything of that nature; in short, to the mute and half−mute play of the dialogue, which seems by degrees fading
away among us altogether. There are indeed some players in Germany, whose bodies figure what they think and
feel; who, by their silence, their delays, their looks, their slight graceful movements, can prepare the audience for
a speech, and by a pleasant sort of pantomime combine the pauses of the dialogue with the general whole; but
such a practice as this, cooperating with a happy natural turn, and training it to compete with the author, is far
from being so habitual as, for the comfort of play−going people, were to be desired."
"But will not a happy natural turn," said Wilhelm, "as the first and last requisite, of itself conduct the player like
every other artist, nay perhaps every other man, to the lofty mark he aims at?"
"The first and the last, the beginning and the end, it may well be; but in the middle, many things will still be
wanting to an artist, if instruction, and early instruction too, have not previously made that of him which he was
meant to be: and perhaps for the man of genius it is worse in this respect than for the man possessed of only
common capabilities; the one may much more easily be misinstructed, and be driven far more violently into false
courses, than the other."
"But," said Wilhelm, "will not genius save itself, not heal the wounds which itself has inflicted?"
"Only to a very small extent, and with great difficulty," said the other, "or perhaps not at all. Let no one think that
he can conquer the first impressions of his youth. If he has grown up in enviable freedom, surrounded with
beautiful and noble objects, in constant intercourse with worthy men; if his masters have taught him what he
needed first to know, for comprehending more easily what followed; if he has never learned anything which he
requires to unlearn; if his first operations have been so guided, that without altering any of his habits, he can more
easily produce what is excellent in future; then such a one will lead a purer, more perfect and happier life, than
another man who has wasted the force of his youth in opposition and error. A great deal is said and written about
education; yet I meet with very few who can comprehend, and transfer to practice, this simple yet vast idea, which
includes within itself all others connected with the subject."
"That may well be true," said Wilhelm, "for the generality of men are limited enough in their conceptions to
suppose that every other should be fashioned by education according to the pattern of themselves. Happy then are
those whom fate takes charge of, and educates according to their several natures!"
"Fate," said the other smiling, "is an excellent, but most expensive schoolmaster. In all cases, I would rather trust
to the reason of a human tutor. Fate, for whose wisdom I entertain all imaginable reverence, often finds in
Chance, by which it works, an instrument not over manageable. At least the latter very seldom seems to execute
precisely and accurately what the former had determined."
"You seem to express a very singular opinion," said Wilhelm.
"Not at all!" replied the other. "Most of what happens in the world confirms my opinion. Do not many incidents at
their commencement show some mighty purport, and generally terminate in something paltry?"
Chapter IX

61

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
"You mean to jest."
"And as to what concerns the individual man," pursued the other, "is it not so with this likewise? Suppose Fate
had appointed one to be a good player; and why should it not provide us with good players as well as other good
things? Chance would perhaps conduct the youth into some puppet−show; where, at such an early age, he could
not help taking interest in what was tasteless and despicable, reckoning insipidities endurable or even pleasing,
and thus corrupting and misdirecting his primary impressions; impressions which can never be effaced, and
whose influence, in spite of all our efforts, cling to us in some degree to the very last."
"What makes you think of puppet−shows?" said Wilhelm, not without some consternation.
"It was an accidental instance; if it does not please you, we shall take another. Suppose Fate had appointed any
one to be a great painter, and it pleased Chance that he should pass his youth in sooty huts, in barns and stables;
do you think that such a man would ever be enabled to exalt himself to purity, to nobleness, to freedom of soul?
The more keenly he may in his youth have seized on the impure, and tried in his own manner to ennoble it, the
more powerfully in the remainder of his life will it be revenged on him; because while he was endeavouring to
conquer it, his whole being has become inseparably combined with it. Whoever spends his early years in mean
and pitiful society, though at an after period he may have the choice of better, will yet constantly look back with
longing towards that which he enjoyed of old, and which has left its impression blended with the memory of all
his young and unreturning pleasures."
From conversation of this sort, it is easy to imagine, the rest of the company had gradually withdrawn. Philina, in
particular, had stept aside at the very outset. Wilhelm and his comrade now rejoined them by a cross−path. Philina
brought out her forfeits, and they had to be redeemed in many different ways. During which business, the
stranger, by the most ingenious devices, and by his frank participation in their sports, recommended himself much
to all the party, and particularly to the ladies; and thus, amid joking, singing, kissing, and railleries of all sorts, the
hours passed away in the most pleasant manner.

Chapter X
WHEN our friends began to think of going home, they looked about them for their clergyman; but he had
vanished, and was nowhere to be found.
"It is not polite in the man, who otherwise displayed good breeding," said Madam Melina, "to desert a company
that welcomed him so kindly, without taking leave."
"I have all the time been thinking," said Laertes, "where I can have seen this singular man before. I fully intended
to ask him about it at parting."
"I too had the same feeling," said Wilhelm, "and certainly I should not have let him go, till he had told us
something more about his circumstances. I am much mistaken if I have not ere now spoken with him
somewhere."
"And you may in truth," said Philina, "be mistaken there. This person seems to have the air of an acquaintance,
because he looks like a man, and not like Jack or Kit."
"What is this?" said Laertes. "Do not we two look like men?"
"I know what I am saying," cried Philina; "and if you cannot understand me, never mind. In the end my words
will be found to require no commentary."
Chapter X

62

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Two coaches now drove up. All praised the attention of Laertes, who had ordered them. Philina, with Madam
Melina, took her place opposite to Wilhelm; the rest bestowed themselves as they best could. Laertes rode back
on Wilhelm's horse, which had likewise been brought out.
Philina was scarcely seated in the coach, when she began to sing some pretty songs, and gradually led the
conversation to some stories, which she said might be successfully treated in the form of dramas. By this cunning
turn she very soon put her young friend into his finest humour: from the wealth of his living imaginative store, he
forthwith constructed a complete play, with all its acts, scenes, characters and plots. It was thought proper to
insert a few catches and songs; they composed them; and Philina, who entered into every part of it, immediately
fitted them with well−known tunes, and sang them on the spot.
It was one of her beautiful, most beautiful days; she had skill to enliven our friend with all manner of diverting
wiles; he felt in spirits such as he had not for many a month enjoyed.
Since that shocking discovery had torn him from the side of Mariana, he had continued true to his vow to be on
his guard against the encircling arms of woman, to avoid the faithless sex, to lock up his inclinations, his sweet
wishes in his own bosom. The conscientiousness with which he had observed this vow gave his whole nature a
secret nourishment; and as his heart could not remain without affection, some loving sympathy had now become a
want with him. He went along once more, as if environed by the first cloudy glories of youth; his eye fixed
joyfully on every charming object, and never had his judgment of a lovely form been more favorable. How
dangerous, in such a situation, this wild girl must have been to him, is but too easy to conceive.
Arrived at home, they found Wilhelm's chamber all ready to receive them; the chairs set right for a public reading;
in midst of them the table, on which the punch−bowl was in due time to take its place.
The German chivalry−plays were new at this period, and had just excited the attention and the inclination of the
public. Old Boisterous had brought one of this sort with him; the reading of it had already been determined on.
They all sat down: Wilhelm took possession of the pamphlet, and began to read.
The harnessed knights, the ancient keeps, the true−heartedness, honesty and downrightness, but especially the
independence of the acting characters, were received with the greatest approbation. The reader did his utmost; and
the audience gradually mounted into rapture. Between the third and fourth act, the punch arrived in an ample
bowl; and there being much fighting and drinking in the piece itself, nothing was more natural than that, on every
such occurrence, the company should transport themselves into the situation of the heroes, should flourish and
strike along with them, and drink long life to their favourites among the dramatis persona.
Each individual of the party was inflamed with the noblest fire of national spirit. How it gratified this German
company to be poetically entertained, according to their own character, on stuff of their own manufacture! In
particular, the vaults and caverns, the ruined castles, the moss and hollow trees, but above all the nocturnal
gipsy−scenes, and the Secret Tribunal, produced a quite incredible effect. Every actor now figured to himself
how, ere long, in helm and harness; every actress how, with a monstrous spreading ruff, she would present her
Germanship before the public. Each would appropriate to himself without delay some name taken from the piece,
or from German history; and Madam Melina declared, that the son or daughter she was then expecting should not
be christened otherwise than by the name of Adelbert or of Mathilde.
Towards the fifth act the approbation became more impetuous and louder; and at last, when the hero actually
trampled down his oppressor, and the tyrant met his doom, the ecstasy increased to such a height, that all averred
they had never passed such happy moments. Melina, whom the liquor had inspired, was the noisiest; and when the
second bowl was empty, and midnight near, Laertes swore through thick and thin, that no living mortal was
worthy ever more to put these glasses to his lips; and, so swearing, he pitched his own right over his head, through
a window−pane, out into the street. The rest followed his example; and notwithstanding the protestations of the
Chapter X

63

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
landlord, who came running in at the noise, the punch−bowl itself, never after this festivity to be polluted by
unholy drink, was dashed into a thousand sherds. Philina, whose exhilaration was the least noticed, the other two
girls by that time having laid themselves upon the sofa in no very elegant positions, maliciously encouraged her
companions in their tumult. Madam Melina recited some spirit−stirring poems; and her husband, not too amiable
in the uproar, began to cavil at the insufficient preparation of the punch, declaring that he could arrange an
entertainment altogether in a different style; and at last becoming sulkier and louder as Laertes commanded
silence, till the latter, without much consideration, threw the fragments of the punch−bowl about his head, and
thereby not a little deepened the confusion.
Meanwhile the town−guard had arrived, and were demanding admission to the house. Wilhelm, much heated by
his reading, though he had drunk but little, had enough to do with the landlord's help to content these people by
money and good words; and afterwards to get the various members of his party sent home in that unseemly case.
On coming back, overpowered with sleep and full of chagrin, he threw himself upon his bed without undressing;
and nothing could exceed his disgust, when, opening his eyes next morning, he looked out with dull sight upon
the devastations of the bygone day, and saw the uncleanness, and the many bad effects, of which that ingenious,
lively and well−intentioned poetical performance had been the cause.

Chapter XI
AFTER a short consideration he called the landlord, and bade him mark to his account both the damage and the
regular charge. At the same time he learned, not without vexation, that his horse had been so hard ridden by
Laertes last night, that, in all probability, it was foundered, as they term it, the farrier having little hope of its
recovering.
A salute from Philina, which she threw him from her window, restored him in some degree to a more cheerful
humour; he went forthwith into the nearest shop to buy her a little present, which, in return for the powder−knife,
he still owed her; and it must be owned that, in selecting his gift, he did not keep himself within the limits of
proportional value. He not only purchased her a pair of earrings; but added likewise a hat and neckerchief, and
some other little articles, which he had seen her lavishly throw from her on the first day of their acquaintance.
Madam Melina, happening to observe him as he was delivering his presents, took an opportunity before breakfast
to rate him very earnestly about his inclination for this girl; at which he felt the more astonished, the less he
thought it merited. He swore solemnly, that he had never once entertained the slightest notion of attaching himself
to such a person, whose whole manner of proceeding was well known to him: he excused himself as well as
possible for his friendly and polite conduct towards her; yet did not by any means content Madam Melina, whose
spite grew ever more determined, as she could not but observe that the flatteries by which she had acquired for
herself a sort of partial regard from our friend, were not sufficient to defend this conquest from the attacks of a
lively, younger and more gifted rival.
As they sat down to table, her husband joined them, likewise in a very fretful humour; which he was beginning to
display on many little things, when the landlord entered to announce a player on the harp. "You will certainly," he
said, "find pleasure in the music and the songs of this man: no one who hears him can forbear to admire him, and
bestow something on him."
"Let him go about his business," said Melina; "I am anything but in a trim for hearing fiddlers, and we have
singers constantly among ourselves disposed to gain a little by their talent." He accompanied these words with a
sarcastic sidelook at Philina: she understood his meaning; and immediately prepared to punish him, by taking up
the cause of the Harper. Turning towards Wilhelm: "Shall we not hear the man?" said she; "shall we do nothing to
save ourselves from this miserable ennui?"

Chapter XI

64

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Melina was going to reply, and the strife would have grown keener, had not the person it related to at that moment
entered. Wilhelm saluted him, and beckoned him to come near.
The figure of this singular guest set the whole party in astonishment; he had found a chair before any one took
heart to ask him a question, or make any observation. His bald crown was encircled by a few gray hairs; and a
pair of large blue eyes looked out softly from beneath his long white eyebrows. To a nose of beautiful proportions
was subjoined a flowing hoary beard, which did not hide the fine shape and position of his lips; and a long
dark−brown garment wrapped his thin body from the neck to the feet. He began to prelude on the harp, which he
had placed before him.
The sweet tones which he drew from his instrument very soon inspirited the company.
"You can sing too, my good old man," said Philina.
"Give us something that shall entertain the spirit and the heart as well as the senses," said Wilhelm. "The
instrument should but accompany the voice; for tunes and melodies without words and meaning seem to me like
butterflies or finely−variegated birds, which hover round us in the air, which we could wish to catch and make our
own; whereas song is like a blessed genius that exalts us towards heaven, and allures the better self in us to attend
him."
The old man looked at Wilhelm; then aloft; then gave some trills upon his harp, and began his song. It contained a
eulogy on minstrelsy; described the happiness of minstrels, and reminded men to honour them. He produced his
song with so much life and truth, that it seemed as if he had composed it at the moment, for this special occasion.
Wilhelm could scarcely refrain from clasping him in his arms; but the fear of awakening a peal of laughter
detained him in his chair; for the rest were already in half−whispers making sundry very shallow observations,
and debating if the Harper was a Papist or a Jew.
On asking about the author of the song, the man gave no distinct reply; declaring only that he was rich in songs,
and anxious that they should please. Most of the party were now merry and joyful: even Melina was grown frank
in his way; and whilst they talked and joked together, the old man began to sing the praise of social life, in the
most sprightly style.
He described the loveliness of unity and courtesy, in soft, soothing tones. Suddenly his music became cold, harsh
and jarring, as he turned to deplore repulsive selfishness, shortsighted enmity and baleful division; and every heart
willingly threw off those galling fetters, while borne on the wings of a piercing melody, he launched forth in
praise of peacemakers, and sang the happiness of souls that, having parted, meet again in love.
Scarcely had he ended, when Wilhelm cried to him: "Whoever thou art, that as a helping spirit comest to us, with
a voice which blesses and revives, accept my reverence and my thanks! Feel that we all admire thee, and confide
in us if thou wantest anything."
The old man spoke not; he threw his fingers softly across the strings: then struck more sharply, and sang:"What
notes are those without the wall, Across the portal sounding?Let's have the music in our hall, Back from its roof
rebounding."So spoke the king, the henchman flies;His answer heard, the monarch cries: "Bring in that ancient
minstrel." "Hail, gracious king, each noble knight! Each lovely dame, I greet you!What glittering stars salute my
sight! What heart unmov'd may meet you!Such lordly pomp is not for me,Far other scenes my eyes must see: Yet
deign to list my harping." The singer turns him to his art, A thrilling strain he raises;Each warrior hears with
glowing heart, And on his lov'd one gazes.The king, who liked his playing well,Commands, for such a kindly
spell, A golden chain be given him. "The golden chain give not to me; Thy boldest knight may wear it,Who
cross'd the battle's purple sea On lion−breast may bear it:Or let it be thy chancellor's prize,Amid his heaps to feast
his eyes, Its yellow glance will please him. "I sing but as the linnet sings, That on the green bough dwellethA rich
Chapter XI

reward his music brings, As from his throat it swelleth:Yet might I ask, I'd ask of thineOne sparkling draught of
purest wine, To drink it here before you." He view'd the wine, he quaff'd it up: "O draught of sweetest savour!O
happy house, where such a cup Is thought a little favour!If well you fare, remember me,And thank kind Heaven,
from envy free, As now for this I thank you."When the Harper, on finishing his song, took up a glass of wine that
stood poured out for him, and, turning with a friendly mien to his entertainers, drank it off, a buzz of joyful
approbation rose from all the party. They clapped hands, and wished him health from that glass, and strength to
his aged limbs. He sang a few other ballads, exciting more and more hilarity among the company.
"Old man," said Philina, "dost thou know the tune, The shepherd deck'd him for the dance?" 7 "O yes!" said he;
"if you will sing the words, I shall not fail for my part of it."
Philina then stood up, and held herself in readiness. The old man commenced the tune; and she sang a song,
which we cannot impart to our readers, lest they might think it insipid, or perhaps undignified.
Meanwhile the company were growing merrier and merrier; they had already emptied several flasks of wine, and
were now beginning to get very loud. But our friend, having fresh in his remembrance the bad consequences of
their late exhilaration, determined to break up the sitting; he slipped into the old man's hand a liberal remuneration
for his trouble, the rest did something likewise; they gave him leave to go and take repose, promising themselves
another entertainment from his skill in the evening.
When he had retired, our friend said to Philina: "In this favourite song of yours I certainly find no merit, either
moral or poetical; yet, if you were to bring forward any proper composition on the stage, with the same arch
simplicity, the same propriety and gracefulness, I should engage that strong and universal approbation would be
the result."
"Yes," said Philina, "it would be a charming thing indeed to warm oneself at ice."
"After all," said Wilhelm, "this old man might put many a player to the blush. Did you notice how correctly the
dramatic part of his ballads was expressed? I maintain, there was more living true representation in his singing,
than in many of our starched characters upon the stage. You would take the acting of many plays for a narrative,
and you might ascribe to these musical narratives a sensible presence."
"You are hardly just!" replied Laertes. "I pretend to no great skill either as a player or a singer; yet I know well
enough, that, when music guides the movements of the body, at once affording to them animation and a scale to
measure it; when declamation and expression are furnished me by the composer, I feel quite a different man from
what I do w hen, in prose−dramas, I have all this to create for myself; have both gesture and declamation to
invent, and am perhaps disturbed in it too by the awkwardness of some partner in the dialogue."
"This much I know," said Melina, "the man certainly may put us to the blush in one point, and that a main one.
The strength of his talent is shown by the profit he derives from it. Even us, who perhaps ere long shall be
embarrassed where to get a meal, he persuades to share our pittance with him. He has skill enough to wile the
money from our pockets with an old song; the money that we should have used to find ourselves employment. So
pleasant an affair is it to squander the means which might procure subsistence to oneself and others."
This remark gave the conversation not the most delightful turn. Wilhelm, for whom the reproach was peculiarly
intended, replied with some heat; and Melina, at no time over studious of delicacy and politeness, explained his
grievances at last in words more plain than courteous. "It is now a fortnight," said he, "since we looked at the
theatrical machinery and wardrobe which is lying pawned here; the whole might be redeemed for a very tolerable
sum. You then gave me hopes that you would lend me so much; and hitherto I do not see that you have thought
more of the matter, or come any nearer a determination. Had you then consented, we should ere now have been
under way. Nor has your intention to leave the place been executed; nor has your money in the mean time been
Chapter XI

spared: at least there are people who have always skill to create opportunities for scattering it faster and faster
away."
Such upbraidings, not altogether undeserved, touched Wilhelm to the quick. He replied with keenness, nay with
anger; and, as the company arose to part, he took hold of the door, and gave them not obscurely to understand that
he would no longer continue with such unfriendly and ungrateful people. He hastened down, in no kindly humour,
and seated himself upon the stone bench without the door of his inn; not observing that, first out of mirth, then out
of spleen, he had drunk more wine than usual.

Chapter XII
AFTER a short time, which he passed sitting looking out before him, disquieted by many thoughts, Philina came
singing and skipping along through the front door. She sat down by him, nay, we might almost say, on him, so
close did she press herself towards him; she leant upon his shoulders, began playing with his hair, patted him, and
gave him the best words in the world. She begged of him to stay with them, and not leave her alone in that
company, or she must die of tedium: she could not live any longer in the same house with Melina, and had come
over to lodge in the other inn for that very reason.
He tried in vain to satisfy her with denials; to make her understand that he neither could nor would remain any
longer. She did not cease with her entreaties; nay, suddenly she threw her arm round his neck, and kissed him
with the liveliest expression of fondness.
"Are you mad, Philina?" cried Wilhelm, endeavouring to disengage himself; "to make the open street the scene of
such caresses, which I nowise merit! Let me go; I cannot and I will not stay."
"And I will hold thee fast," said she, "and kiss thee here on the open street, and kiss thee till thou promise what I
want. I shall die of laughing," she continued; "by this familiarity the good people here must take me for thy wife
of four weeks' standing; and husbands, who witness this touching scene, will commend me to their wives as a
pattern of childlike simple tenderness."
Some persons were just then going by; she caressed him in the most graceful way; and he, to avoid giving
scandal, was constrained to play the part of the patient husband. Then she made faces at the people, when their
backs were turned; and, in the wildest humour, continued to commit all sorts of improprieties, till at last he was
obliged to promise that he would not go that day, or the morrow, or the next day.
"You are a true clod!" said she, quitting him; "and I am but a fool to spend so much kindness on you." She arose
with some vexation, and walked a few steps, then turned round laughing, and cried: "I believe it is just that, after
all, that makes me so crazy about thee. I will but go and seek my knitting−needles and my stocking, that I may
have something to do. Stay there, and let me find the stone man still upon the stone bench when I come back."
She cast a sparkling glance on him, and went into the house. He had no call to follow her; on the contrary, her
conduct had excited fresh aversion in him: yet he rose from the bench to go after her, not well knowing why.
He was just entering the door, when Melina passed by, and spoke to him in a respectful tone, asking his pardon
for the somewhat too harsh expressions he had used in their late discussion. "You will not take it ill of me,"
continued he, "if I appear perhaps too fretful in my present circumstances. The charge of providing for a wife,
perhaps soon for a child, forbids me from day to day to live at peace, or spend my time, as you may do, in the
enjoyment of pleasant feelings. Consider, I pray you; and, if possible, do put me in possession of that
stage−machinery that is lying here. I shall not be your debtor long, and I shall be obliged to you while I live."

Chapter XII

67

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Our friend, unwilling to be kept upon the threshold, over which an irresistible impulse was drawing him at that
moment to Philina, answered, with an absent mind, eager to be gone, and surprised into a transient feeling of
good−will: "If I can make you happy and contented by doing this, I will hesitate no longer. Go you and put
everything to rights. I shall be prepared this evening, or tomorrow morning, to pay the money." He then gave his
hand to Melina in confirmation of his promise, and was very glad to see him hastily proceed along the street; but,
alas, his entrance, which he now thought sure, was a second time prohibited, and more disagreeably than at first.
A young man, with a bundle on his back, came walking fast along the street, and advanced to Wilhelm, who at
once recognised him for Friedrich. "Here am I again!" cried he, looking with his large blue eyes joyfully up and
down, over all the windows of the house. "Where is Mamsell? Devil take me, if I can stroll about the world any
longer without seeing her."
The landlord, joining them at this instant, replied that she was above; Friedrich with a few bounds was up−stairs,
and Wilhelm continued standing as if rooted to the threshold. At the first instant he was tempted to pluck the
younker back, and drag him down by the hair; then all at once the spasm of a sharp jealousy stopped the current of
his spirits and ideas; and, as he gradually recovered from this stupefaction, there came over him a splenetic fit of
restlessness, a general discomfort, such as he had never felt in his life before.
He went up to his room, and found Mignon busy writing. For some time, the creature had been labouring with
great diligence in writing everything she knew by heart, giving always to her master and friend the papers to
correct. She was indefatigable, and of good comprehension; but still her letters were irregular, and her lines
crooked. Here too the body seemed to contradict the mind. In his usual moods, Wilhelm took no small pleasure in
the child's attention; but at the present moment he regarded little what she showed him,−a piece of neglect which
she felt the more acutely, as on this occasion she conceived her work had been accomplished with peculiar
success.
Wilhelm's unrest drove him up and down the passages of the house, and finally again to the street−door. A rider
was just prancing towards it, a man of good appearance, of middle age, and a brisk contented look. The landlord
ran to meet him, holding out his hand as to an old acquaintance. "Ay, Herr Stallmeister," cried he, "have we the
pleasure to see you again?"
"I am just going to bait with you," replied the stranger, "and then along to the Estate, to get matters put in order as
soon as possible. The Count is coming over tomorrow with his lady; they mean to stay a while to entertain the
Prince von−in their best style: he intends to fix his headquarters in this neighbourhood for some time."
"It is pity," said the landlord, "that you cannot stop with us: we have good company in the house." The ostler
came running out, and took the horse from the Stallmeister, who continued talking in the door with the landlord,
and now and then giving a look at Wilhelm.
Our friend, observing that he formed the topic of their conversation, went away, and walked up and down the
streets.

Chapter XIII
IN the restless vexation of his present humour, it came into his head to go and see the old Harper, hoping by his
music to scare away the evil spirits that tormented him. On asking for the man, he was directed to a mean
publichouse in a remote corner of the little town; and, having mounted up−stairs there to the very garret, his ear
caught the fine twanging of the harp coming from a little room before him. They were heart−moving, mournful
tones, accompanied by a sad and dreary singing. Wilhelm glided to the door; and, as the good old man was
performing a sort of voluntary, the few stanzas of which, sometimes chanted, sometimes in recitative, were
Chapter XIII

68

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
repeated more than once, our friend succeeded, after listening for a while, in gathering nearly this:Who never ate
his bread in sorrow, Who never spent the darksome hoursWeeping and watching for the morrow, He knows ye
not, ye gloomy Powers. To earth, this weary earth, ye bring us, To guilt ye let us heedless go,Then leave
repentance fierce to wring us: A moment's guilt, an age of woe!The heart−sick plaintive sound of this lament
pierced deep into the soul of the hearer. It seemed to him as if the old man were often stopped from proceeding by
his tears; his harp would alone be heard for a time, till his voice again jointed it in low broken tones. Wilhelm
stood by the door; he was much moved; the mourning of this stranger had again opened the avenues of his heart;
he could not resist the claim of sympathy, or restrain the tears which this woe−begone complaint at last called
forth. All the pains that pressed upon his soul seemed now at once to loosen from their hold; he abandoned
himself without reserve to the feelings of the moment. Pushing up the door, he stood before the Harper. The old
man was sitting on a mean bed, the only seat, or article of furniture, which his miserable room afforded.
"What feelings hast thou not awakened in me, good old man!" exclaimed he. "All that was lying frozen at my
heart thou hast melted, and put in motion. Let me not disturb thee; but continue, in solacing thy own sorrows, to
confer happiness upon a friend." The Harper was about to rise, and say something; but Wilhelm hindered him, for
he had noticed in the morning that the old man did not like to speak. He sat down by him on the straw bed.
The old man wiped his eyes, and asked, with a friendly smile, "How came you hither? I meant to wait upon you in
the evening again."
"We are more quiet here," said Wilhelm. "Sing to me what thou pleasest, what accords with thy own mood of
mind, only proceed as if I were not by. It seems to me that today thou canst not fail to suit me. I think thee very
happy that, in solitude, thou canst employ and entertain thyself so pleasantly; that, being everywhere a stranger,
thou findest in thy own heart the most agreeable society."
The old man looked upon his strings, and, after touching them softly by way of prelude, he commenced and
sang:Who longs in solitude to live, Ah! soon his wish will gain;Men hope and love, men get and give, And leave
him to his pain.Yes, leave me to my moan! When from my bed You all are fled,I still am not alone. The lover
glides with footstep light: His love, is she not waiting there?So glides to meet me, day and night, In solitude my
care, In solitude my woe:True solitude I then shall know When lying in my grave, When lying in my grave,And
grief has let me go.
We might describe with great prolixity, and yet fail to express the charms of the singular conversation, which
Wilhelm carried on with this wayfaring stranger. To every observation which our friend addressed to him, the old
man, with the nicest accordance, answered in some melody, which awakened all the cognate emotions, and
opened a wide field to the imagination.
Whoever has happened to assist at a meeting of certain devout people, who conceive that, in a state of separation
from the Church, they can edify each other in a purer, more affecting, and more spiritual manner, may form to
himself some conception of the present scene. He will recollect how the leader of the meeting would append to
his words some verse of a song, that raised the soul till, as he wished, she took wing; how another of the flock
would ere long subjoin, in a different tune, some verse of a different song; and to this again a third would link
some verse of a third song; by which means the kindred ideas of the songs to which the verses belonged were
indeed suggested, yet each passage by its new combination became new and individualised, as if it had been first
composed that moment; and thus, from a well−known circle of ideas, from well−known songs and sayings, there
was formed, for that particular society in that particular time, an original whole, by means of which their minds
were animated, strengthened and refreshed. So likewise did the old man edify his guest: by known and unknown
songs and passages, he brought feelings near and distant, emotions sleeping and awake, pleasant and painful, into
a circulation, from which, in Wilhelm's actual state, the best effects might be anticipated.

Chapter XIII

Chapter XIV
ACCORDINGLY, in walking back, he began to think with greater earnestness than ever on his present situation:
he had reached home with the firm purpose of altering it, when the landlord disclosed to him, by way of secret,
that Mademoiselle Philina had made a conquest of the Count's Stallmeister; who, after executing his commission
at his master's Estate, had returned in the greatest haste, and was even now partaking of a good supper with her up
in her chamber.
At this very moment Melina came in with a notary: they went into Wilhelm's chamber together, where the latter,
though with some hesitation, made his promise good; gave a draught of three hundred crowns to Melina, who,
handing it to the lawyer, received in return a note acknowledging the sale of the whole theatrical apparatus, and
engaging to deliver it next morning.
Scarcely had they parted, when Wilhelm heard a cry of horror rising from some quarter of the house. He caught
the sound of a young voice, uttering menacing and furious tones, which were ever and anon choked by
immoderate weeping and howling. He observed this frantic noise move hastily from above; go past his door, and
down to the lower part of the house.
Curiosity enticing our friend to follow it, he found Friedrich in a species of delirium. The boy was weeping,
grinding his teeth, stamping with his feet, threatening with clenched fists; he appeared beside himself from fury
and vexation. Mignon was standing opposite him, looking on with astonishment. The landlord, in some degree,
explained this phenomenon.
The boy, he said, being well received at his return by Philina, seemed quite merry and contented; he had kept
singing and jumping about, till the time when Philina grew acquainted with the Stallmeister. Then, however, this
half−grown younker had begun to show his indignation, to slam the doors, and run up and down in the highest
dudgeon. Philina had ordered him to wait at table that evening; upon which he had grown still sulkier and more
indignant; till at last, carrying up a plate with a ragout, instead of setting it upon the table, he had thrown the
whole between Mademoiselle and her guest, who were sitting moderately close together at the time; and the
Stallmeister, after two or three hearty cuffs, had then kicked him out of the room. He, the landlord, had himself
helped to clean both of them, and certainly their clothes had suffered much.
On hearing of the good effect of his revenge, the boy began to laugh aloud, whilst the tears were still running
down his cheeks. He heartily rejoiced for a time, till the disgrace which he had suffered from the stronger party
once more came into his head, and he began afresh to howl and threaten.
Wilhelm stood meditating, and ashamed at this spectacle. It reflected back to him his own feelings, in coarser and
exaggerated features: he too was inflamed with a fierce jealousy; and had not decency restrained him, he would
willingly have satisfied his wild humour; with malicious spleen, would have abused the object of his passion, and
called out his rival: he could have crushed in pieces all the people round him; they seemed as if standing there but
to vex him.
Laertes also had come in, and heard the story; he roguishly spurred on the irritated boy, who was now asserting
with oaths that he would make the Stallmeister give him satisfaction; that he had never yet let any injury abide
with him; that should the man refuse, there were other ways of taking vengeance.
This was the very business for Laertes. He went upstairs, with a solemn countenance, to call out the Stallmeister
in the boy's name.
"This is a pleasant thing," said the Stallmeister: "such a joke as this I had scarcely promised myself to−night."
Chapter XIV

70

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
They went down, and Philina followed them. "My son," said the Stallmeister to Friedrich, thou art a brave lad,
and I do not hesitate to fight thee. Only as our years and strength are unequal, and the attempt a little dangerous
on that account, I propose a pair of foils in preference to other weapons. We can rub the buttons of them with a
piece of chalk; and whoever marks upon the other's coat the first or the most thrusts, shall be held the victor, and
be treated by the other with the best wine that can be had in town."
Laertes decided that the proposition might be listened to: Friedrich obeyed him as his tutor. The foils were
produced; Philina took a seat, went on with her knitting, and looked at the contending parties with the greatest
peace of mind.
The Stallmeister, who could fence very prettily, was complaisant enough to spare his adversary, and to let a few
chalk−scores be marked upon his coat; after which the two embraced, and wine was ordered. The Stallmeister
took the liberty of asking Friedrich's parentage and history; and Friedrich told him a long story, which had often
been repeated already, and which, on some other opportunity, we purpose communicating to our readers.
To Wilhelm, in the mean time, this contest completed the representation of his own state of mind. He could not
but perceive that he would willingly have taken up a foil against the Stallmeister; a sword still more willingly,
though evidently much his inferior in the science of defence. Yet he deigned not to cast one look on Philina; he
was on his guard against any word or movement that could possibly betray his feelings; and after having once or
twice done justice to the health of the duellists, he hastened to his own room, where a thousand painful thoughts
came pressing round him.
He called to memory the time when his spirit, rich in hope, and full of boundless aims, was raised aloft, and
encircled with the liveliest enjoyments of every kind as with its proper element. He now clearly saw, that of late
he had fallen into a broken wandering path, where, if he tasted, it was but in drops what he once quaffed in
unrestricted measure. But he could not clearly see what insatiable want it was that nature had made the law of his
being; and how this want had been only set on edge, half satisfied, and misdirected by the circumstances of his
life.
It will not surprise us, therefore, that, in considering his situation, and labouring to extricate himself, he fell into
the greatest perplexity. It was not enough, that, by his friendship for Laertes, his attachment to Philina, his
concern for Mignon, he had been detained longer than was proper in a place and a society where he could cherish
his darling inclination, content his wishes as it were by stealth, and without proposing any object, again pursue his
early dreams. These ties he believed himself possessed of force enough to break asunder: had there been nothing
more to hold him, he could have gone at once. But, only a few moments ago, he had entered into
money−transactions with Melina; he had seen that mysterious old man, the enigma of whose history he longed
with unspeakable desire to clear. Yet of this too, after much balancing of reasons, he at length determined, or
thought he had determined, that it should not keep him back. "I must go," he exclaimed; "I will go." He threw
himself into a chair; he felt greatly moved. Mignon came in, and asked, Whether she might help to undress him?
Her manner was still and shy; it had grieved her to the quick to be so abruptly dismissed by him before.
Nothing is more touching than the first disclosure of a love which has been nursed in silence, of a faith grown
strong in secret, and which at last comes forth in the hour of need, and reveals itself to him who formerly has
reckoned it of small account. The bud, which had been closed so long and firmly, was now ripe to burst its
swathings, and Wilhelm's heart could never have been readier to welcome the impressions of affection.
She stood before him, and noticed his disquietude. "Master!" she cried, "if thou art unhappy, what will become of
Mignon?" "Dear little creature," said he, taking her hands, "thou too art part of my anxieties. I must go hence."
She looked at his eyes, glistening with restrained tears; and knelt down with vehemence before him. He kept her
hands; she laid her head upon his knees, and remained quite still. He played with her hair, patted her, and spoke
kindly to her. She continued motionless for a considerable time. At last he felt a sort of palpitating movement in
Chapter XIV

71

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
her, which began very softly, and then by degrees with increasing violence diffused itself over all her frame.
"What ails thee, Mignon?" cried he; "what ails thee?" She raised her little head, looked at him, and all at once laid
her hand upon her heart, with the countenance of one repressing the utterance of pain. He raised her up, and she
fell upon his breast; he pressed her towards him, and kissed her. She replied not by any pressure of the hand, by
any motion whatever. She held firmly against her heart; and all at once gave a cry, which was accompanied by
spasmodic movements of the body. She started up, and immediately fell down before him, as if broken in every
joint. It was an excruciating moment! "My child!" cried he, raising her up, and clasping her fast; "my child, what
ails thee?" The palpitations continued, spreading from the heart over all the lax and powerless limbs; she was
merely hanging in his arms. All at once she again became quite stiff, like one enduring the sharpest corporeal
agony; and soon with a new vehemence all her frame once more became alive; and she threw herself about his
neck, like a bent spring closing; while in her soul, as it were, a strong rent took place, and at the same moment a
stream of tears flowed from her shut eyes into his bosom. He held her fast. She wept, and no tongue can express
the force of these tears. Her long hair had loosened, and was hanging down before her; it seemed as if her whole
being was melting incessantly into a brook of tears. Her rigid limbs were again become relaxed; her inmost soul
was pouring itself forth; in the wild confusion of the moment, Wilhelm was afraid she would dissolve in his arms,
and leave nothing there for him to grasp. He held her faster and faster. "My child!" cried he, "my child! Thou art
indeed mine, if that word can comfort thee. Thou art mine! I will keep thee, I will never forsake thee!" Her tears
continued flowing. At last she raised herself; a faint gladness shone upon her face. "My father!" cried she, "thou
wilt not forsake me? Wilt be my father? I am thy child!"
Softly, at this moment, the harp began to sound before the door; the old man brought his most affecting songs as
an evening offering to our friend, who, holding his child ever faster in his arms, enjoyed the most pure and
undescribable felicity.

Book III
Chapter I
Know'st thou the land where lemon−trees do bloom,And oranges like gold in leafy gloom;A gentle wind from
deep blue heaven blows,The myrtle thick, and high the laurel grows?Know'st thou it, then? 'Tis there! 'tis there,O
my belov'd one, I with thee would go! Know'st thou the house, its porch with pillars tall?The rooms do glitter,
glitters bright the hall,And marble statues stand, and look me on:What's this, poor child, to thee they've
done?Know'st thou it, then? 'Tis there! 'tis there,O my protector, I with thee would go! Know'st thou the mountain
bridge that hangs on cloud?The mules in mist grope o'er the torrent loud,In caves lie coil'd the dragon's ancient
brood,The crag leaps down and over it the flood:Know'st thou it, then? 'Tis there! 'tis thereOur way runs; O my
father, wilt thou go?NEXT morning, on looking for Mignon about the house, Wilhelm did not find her; but was
informed that she had gone out early with Melina, who had risen betimes to receive the wardrobe and other
apparatus of his theatre.
After the space of some hours, Wilhelm heard the sound of music before his door. At first he thought it was the
Harper come again to visit him; but he soon distinguished the tones of a cithern, and the voice which began to
sing was Mignon's. Wilhelm opened the door; the child came in, and sang him the song we have just given above.
The music and general expression of it pleased our friend extremely, though he could not understand all the
words. He made her once more repeat the stanzas, and explain them; he wrote them down, and translated them
into his native language. But the originality of its turns he could imitate only from afar; its childlike innocence of
expression vanished from it in the process of reducing its broken phraseology to uniformity, and combining its
disjointed parts. The charm of the tune, moreover, was entirely incomparable.

Book III

72

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
She began every verse in a stately and solemn manner, as if she wished to draw attention towards something
wonderful, as if she had something weighty to communicate. In the third line, her tones became deeper and
gloomier; the Know'st thou it, then? was uttered with a show of mystery and eager circumspectness; in the 'T is
there! 'tis there! lay a boundless longing; and her I with thee would go! she modified at each repetition, so that
now it appeared to entreat and implore, now to impel and persuade.
On finishing her song for the second time, she stood silent for a moment, looked keenly at Wilhelm, and asked
him, "Know'st thou the land?" "It must mean Italy," said Wilhelm: "where didst thou get the little song?" "Italy!"
said Mignon with an earnest air: "If thou go to Italy, take me along with thee; for I am too cold here." "Hast thou
been there already, little dear?" said Wilhelm. But the child was silent, and nothing more could be got out of her.
Melina entered now; he looked at the cithern; was glad that she had rigged it up again so prettily. The instrument
had been among Melina's stage−gear; Mignon had begged it of him in the morning; and then gone to the old
Harper. On this occasion, she had shown a talent she was not before suspected of possessing.
Melina had already got possession of his wardrobe, with all that pertained to it; some members of the town
magistracy had promised him permission to act, for a time, in the place. He was now returning with a merry heart
and a cheerful look. His nature seemed altogether changed; he was soft, courteous to every one, nay fond of
obliging, and almost attractive. He was happy, he said, at now being able to afford employment to his friends,
who had hitherto lain idle and embarrassed; sorry, however, that at first he could not have it in his power to
remunerate the excellent actors whom fortune had offered him, in a style corresponding to their talents and
capacities; being under the necessity, before all other things, of discharging his debt to so generous a friend as
Wilhelm had proved himself to be.
"I cannot describe," said he to Wilhelm, "the friendliness which you have shown, in helping me forward to the
management of a theatre. When I found you here, I was in a very curious predicament. You recollect how
strongly I displayed to you, on our first acquaintance, my aversion to the stage; and yet, on being married, I was
forced to look about for a place in some theatre, out of love to my wife, who promised to herself much joy and
great applause, if so engaged. I could find none, at least no constant one; but in return I luckily fell in with some
commercial men, who, in extraordinary cases, were enabled to employ a person that could handle his pen, that
understood French, and was not without a little skill in ciphering. I managed pretty well in this way, for a time; I
was tolerably paid; got about me many things which I had need of, and did not feel ashamed of my work. But
these commissions of my patrons came to an end; they could afford me no permanent establishment: and ever
since, my wife has continued urging me still more to go upon the stage again; though, at present, alas, her own
situation is none of the favourablest for exhibiting herself, with honour, in the eyes of the public. But now, I hope,
the establishment, which by your kind help I have the means of setting up, will prove a good beginning for me
and mine; you I shall thank for all my future happiness, let matters turn out as they will."
Wilhelm listened to him with contentment: the whole fraternity of players were likewise moderately satisfied with
the declarations of the new manager; they secretly rejoiced that an offer of employment had occurred so soon; and
were disposed to put up, at first, with a smaller salary; the rather, that most of them regarded the present one, so
unexpectedly placed within their reach, as a kind of supplement, on which a short while ago they could not count.
Melina made haste to profit by this favourable temper; he endeavoured in a sly way to get a little talk with each in
private; and ere long had, by various methods, so cockered them all, that they did not hesitate to strike a bargain
with him, without loss of time; scarcely thinking of this new engagement, or reckoning themselves secure at worst
of getting free again after six weeks' warning.
The terms were now to be reduced to proper form, and Melina was considering with what pieces he would first
entice the public, when a courier riding up informed the Stallmeister, that his lord and lady were at hand; on
which the latter ordered out his horses.

In a short time after this, the coach with its masses of luggage rolled in; two servants sprang down from the
coach−box before the inn; and Philina, according to her custom, foremost in the way of novelties, placed herself
within the door.
"Who are you?" said the Countess entering the house.
"An actress, at your Excellency's service," was the answer; while the cheat, with a most innocent air, and looks of
great humility, courtesied, and kissed the lady's gown.
The Count, on seeing some other persons standing round, who also signified that they were players, inquired
about the strength of their company, their last place of residence, their manager. "Had they but been Frenchmen,"
said he to his lady, "we might have treated the Prince with an unexpected enjoyment, and entertained him with his
favourite pastime at our house."
"And could we not," said the Countess, "get these people, though unluckily they are but Germans, to exhibit with
us at the Castle, while the Prince stays there? Without doubt, they have some degree of skill. A large party can
never be so well amused with anything as with a theatre; besides the Baron would assist them."
So speaking they went up−stairs; and Melina presented himself above, as manager. "Call your folk together," said
the Count, "and place them before me, that I may see what is in them. I must also have the list of pieces you
profess to act."
Melina, with a low bow, hastened from the room, and soon returned with his actors. They advanced in
promiscuous succession; some, out of too great anxiety to please, introduced themselves in a rather sorry style;
the others, not much better, by assuming an air of unconcern. Philina showed the deepest reverence to the
Countess, who behaved with extreme graciousness and condescension; the Count, in the mean time, was
mustering the rest. He questioned each about his special province of acting; and signified to Melina, that he must
rigorously keep them to their several provinces; a precept which the manager received with the greatest devotion.
The Count then stated to each in particular what he ought especially to study, what about his figure or his postures
ought to be amended; showed them luminously in what points the Germans always fail; and displayed such
extra−ordinary knowledge, that all stood in the deepest humility, scarcely daring to draw their breath, before so
enlightened a critic and so right honourable a patron.
"What fellow is that in the corner?" said the Count, looking at a subject, who had not yet been presented to him,
and who now approached; a lean shambling figure, with a rusty coat patched at the elbows, and a woful periwig
covering his submissive head.
This person, whom, from the last Book, we know already as Philina's darling, had been wont to enact pedants,
tutors and poets; generally undertaking parts in which any cudgelling or ducking was to be endured. He had
trained himself to certain crouching, ludicrous, timid bows; and his faltering, stammering speech befitted the
characters he played, and created laughter in the audience; so that he was always looked on as a useful member of
the company, being moreover very serviceable and obliging. He approached the Count in his own peculiar way;
bent himself before him, and answered every question with the grimaces and gestures he was used to on the stage.
The Count looked at him, for some time, with an air of attentive satisfaction and studious observation; then
turning to the Countess, "Child," said he, "consider this man well: I will engage for it, he is a great actor, or may
become so." The creature here, in the fulness of his heart, made an idiotic bow; the Count burst into laughing, and
exclaimed: "He does it excellently well! I bet this fellow can act anything he likes; it is pity that he has not been
already used to something better."

So singular a prepossession was extremely galling to the rest; Melina alone felt no vexation, but completely
coincided with the Count, and answered with a prostrate look: "Alas! it is too true; both he and others of us have
long stood in need of such encouragement, and such a judge, as we now find in your Excellency."
"Is this the whole company?" inquired the Count.
"Some of them are absent," said the crafty Melina; "and at any rate, if we should meet with support, we could
soon collect abundant numbers from the neighbourhood."
Philina in the mean while was saying to the Countess: "There is a very pretty young man above, who without
doubt would shortly become a first−rate amateur."
"Why does not he appear?" said the Countess.
"I will bring him," cried Philina, hastening to the door.
She found our friend still occupied with Mignon; she persuaded him to come down. He followed her with some
reluctance; yet curiosity impelled him: for hearing that the family were people of rank, he longed much to know
more of them. On entering the room his eyes met those of the Countess, which were directed towards him. Philina
led him to the lady, while the Count was busied with the rest. Wilhelm made his bow; and replied to several
questions from the fair dame, not without confusion of mind. Her beauty and youth, her graceful dignity and
refined manner, made the most delightful impression on him; and the more so, as her words and looks were
accompanied with a certain bashfulness, one might almost say embarrassment. He was likewise introduced to the
Count, who however took no special notice of him; but went to the window with his lady, and seemed to ask her
about something. It was easy to observe that her opinion accorded strongly with his own; that she even tried to
persuade him, and strengthen him in his intentions.
In a short while, he turned round to the company, and said: "I must not stay at present, but I will send a friend to
you; and if you make reasonable proposals, and will take very great pains, I am not disinclined to let you play at
the Castle."
All testified their joy at this; Philina in particular kissed the hands of the Countess with the greatest vivacity.
"Look you, little thing," said the lady, patting the cheeks of the light−minded girl, "look you, child, you shall
come to me again; I will keep my promise; only you must dress better." Philina stated in excuse that she had little
to lay out upon her wardrobe; and the Countess immediately ordered her waiting−maids to bring from the carriage
a silk neckerchief and an English hat, the articles easiest to come at, and give them to her new favourite. The
Countess herself then decked Philina, who continued very neatly to support, by her looks and conduct, that
saint−like, guiltless character she had assumed at first.
The Count took his lady's hand and led her down. She bowed to the whole company with a friendly air, in passing
by them; she turned round again towards Wilhelm, and said to him, with the most gracious mien: "We shall soon
meet again."
These happy prospects enlivened the whole party: every one of them gave free course to his hopes, his wishes, his
imaginations; spoke of the parts he would play, and the applause he would acquire. Melina was considering how
he might still, by a few speedy exhibitions, gain a little money from the people of the town, before he left it; while
others went into the kitchen, to order a better dinner than of late they had been used to.

Chapter II
AFTER a few days, the Baron came; and it was not without fear that Melina received him. The Count had spoken
of him as a critic; and it might be dreaded, he would speedily detect the weakness of the little party, and see that it
formed no efficient troop, there being scarcely a play which they could act in a suitable manner. But the manager,
as well as all the members, were soon delivered from their cares, on finding that the Baron was a man who viewed
the German stage with a most patriotic enthusiasm, to whom every player, and every company of players, was
welcome and agreeable. He saluted them all with great solemnity; was happy to come upon a German theatre so
unexpectedly, to get connected with it, and to introduce their native Muses to the mansion of his relative. He then
pulled out from his pocket a bundle of stitched papers, in which Melina hoped to find the terms of their contract
specified; but it proved something very different. It was a drama, which the Baron himself had composed, and
wished to have played by them: he requested their attention while he read it. Willingly they formed a circle round
him; charmed at being able with so little trouble to secure the favour of a man so important; though judging by the
thickness of the manuscript, it was clear that a very long rehearsal might be dreaded. Their apprehensions were
not groundless; the piece was written in five acts, and that sort of acts which never have an end.
The hero was an excellent, virtuous, magnanimous and at the same time misunderstood and persecuted man; this
worthy person, after many trials, gained the victory at last over all his enemies; on whom, in consequence, the
most rigorous poetic justice would have been exercised, had he not pardoned them on the spot.
While this piece was rehearsing, each of the auditors had leisure enough to think of himself, and to mount up
quite softly from the humble prostration of mind, to which, a little while ago, he had felt disposed, into a
comfortable state of contentment with his own gifts and advantages; and from this elevation, to discover the most
pleasing prospects in the future. Such of them as found in the play no parts adapted for their own acting, internally
pronounced it bad, and viewed the Baron as a miserable author; while the others, every time they noticed any
passage which they hoped might procure them a little clapping of the hands exalted it with the greatest praise, to
the immeasurable satisfaction of the author.
The commercial part of their affair was soon completed. Melina made an advantageous bargain with the Baron,
and contrived to keep it secret from the rest.
Of our friend, Melina took occasion to declare in passing, that he seemed to be successfully qualifying himself for
becoming a dramatic poet, and even to have some capacities for being an actor. The Baron introduced himself to
Wilhelm as a colleague; and the latter by and by produced some little pieces, which, with a few other relics, had
escaped by chance, on the day when he threw the greater part of his works into the flames. The Baron lauded both
his pieces and delivery; he spoke of it as a settled thing, that Wilhelm should come over to the Castle with the
rest. For all, at his departure, he engaged to find the best reception, comfortable quarters, a good table, applauses
and presents; and Melina farther gave the promise of a certain modicum of pocket−money to each.
It is easy to conceive how this visit raised the spirits of the party; instead of a low and harassing situation, they
now at once saw honours and enjoyment before them. On the score of these great hopes they already made merry;
and each thought it needless and stingy to retain a single groschen of money in his purse.
Meanwhile our friend was taking counsel with himself, about accompanying the troop to the Castle; and he found
it, in more than one sense, advisable to do so. Melina was in hopes of paying off his debt, at least in part, by this
engagement; and Wilhelm, who had come from home to study men, was unwilling to let slip this opportunity of
examining the great world, where he expected to obtain much insight into life, into himself and the dramatic art.
With all this, he durst not confess how greatly he wished again to be near the beautiful Countess. He rather sought
to persuade himself in general of the mighty advantages, which a more intimate acquaintance with the world of
Chapter II

76

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
rank and wealth would procure for him. He pursued his reflections on the Count, the Countess, the Baron; on the
security, the grace and propriety of their demeanour; he exclaimed with rapture when alone:
"Thrice happy are they to be esteemed, whom their birth of itself exalts above the lower stages of mankind; who
do not need to traverse those perplexities, not even to skirt them, in which many worthy men so painfully
consume the whole period of life. Far−extending and unerring must their vision be, on that higher station; easy
each step of their progress in the world! From their very birth, they are placed as it were in a ship, which, in this
voyage we have all to make, enables them to profit by the favourable winds, and to ride out the cross ones; while
others, bare of help, must wear their strength away in swimming, can derive little profit from the favourable
breeze, and in the storm must soon become exhausted and sink to the bottom. What convenience, what ease of
movement does a fortune we are born to, confer upon us! How securely does a traffic flourish, which is founded
on a solid capital, where the failure of one or of many enterprises does not of necessity reduce us to inaction! Who
can better know the worth and worthlessness of earthly things, than he that has had within his choice the
enjoyment of them from youth upwards; and who can earlier guide his mind to the useful, the necessary, the true,
than he that may convince himself of so many errors in an age when his strength is yet fresh to begin a new
career!"
Thus did our friend cry joy to all inhabitants of the upper regions; and not to them only, but to all that were
permitted to approach their circle, and draw water from their wells. So he thanked his own happy stars, that
seemed preparing to grant this mighty blessing to himself.
Melina, in the mean time, was torturing his brains to get the company arranged according to their several
provinces, and each of them appointed to produce his own peculiar effect. In compliance with the Count's
injunctions and his own persuasions, he made many efforts: but at last, when it came to the point of execution, he
was forced to be content, if, in so small a troop, he found his people willing to adjust themselves to this or that
part, as they best were able. When matters would admit of it, Laertes played the lover; Philina the lady's−maid;
the two young girls took up between them the characters of the artless and tender loved−ones; the boisterous old
gentleman of the piece was sure to be the best acted. Melina himself thought he might come forth as chevalier;
Madame Melina, to her no small sorrow, was obliged to satisfy herself with personating young wives, or even
affectionate mothers; and as in the newer plays a poet or pedant is rarely introduced, and still more rarely for the
purpose of being laughed at, the well−known favourite of the Count was now usually transformed into president
or minister; these being commonly set forth as knaves, and severely handed in the fifth act. Melina too, in the part
of chamberlain or the like, introduced, with great satisfaction, the ineptitudes put into his hands by various honest
Germans, according to use and wont, in many well−accepted plays: he delighted in these characters, because he
had an opportunity of decking himself out in a fashionable style, and was called upon to assume the airs of a
courtier, which he conceived himself to possess in great perfection.
It was not long till they were joined by several actors from different quarters; who being received without very
strict examination, were also retained without very burdensome conditions.
Wilhelm had been more than once assailed with persuasions from Melina to undertake an amateur part. This he
declined; yet he interested and occupied himself about the general cause with great alacrity, without our new
manager's acknowledging his labours in the smallest. On the contrary, it seemed to be Melina's opinion, that with
his office he had at the same time picked up all the necessary skill for carrying it on. In particular, the task of
curtailment formed one of his most pleasing occupations; he would succeed in reducing any given piece down to
the regular measure of time, without the slightest respect to proprieties or proportions, or anything whatever but
his watch. He met with great encouragement; the public was very much delighted; the most knowing inhabitants
of the burgh maintained that the Prince's theatre itself was not so well conducted as theirs.

Chapter III
AT last the time arrived when the company had to prepare themselves for travelling, and to expect the coaches
and other vehicles that were to carry them to the Count's mansion. Much altercation now took place about the
mode of travelling, and who should sit with whom. The ordering and distribution of the whole was at length
settled and concluded, with great labour, and, alas, without effect. At the appointed hour, fewer coaches came
than were expected; they had to accommodate themselves as the case would admit. The Baron, who followed
shortly afterwards on horseback, assigned as the reason, that all was in motion at the Castle, not only because the
Prince was to arrive a few days earlier than had been looked for, but also because an unexpected party of visitors
were already come; the place, he said, was in great confusion; on this account perhaps they would not lodge so
comfortably as had been intended; a change which grieved him very much.
Our travellers packed themselves into the carriages the best way they could; and the weather being tolerable, and
the Castle but a few leagues distant, the heartiest of the troop preferred setting out on foot to waiting the return of
the coaches. The caravan got under way with great jubilee; for the first time, without caring how the landlord's bill
was to be paid. The Count's mansion rose like a palace of the fairies on their souls; they were the happiest and
merriest mortals in the world. Each throughout the journey, in his own peculiar mode, kept fastening a continued
chain of fortune, honour and prosperity to that auspicious day.
A heavy rain, which fell unexpectedly, did not banish these delightful contemplations; though, as it incessantly
continued with more and more violence, many of the party began to show traces of uneasiness. The night came
on; and no sight could be more welcome than the palace of the Count, which shone upon them from a hill at some
distance, glancing with light in all its stories, so that they could reckon every window.
On approaching nearer, they found all the windows in the wings illuminated also. Each of the party thought
within himself what chamber would be his; and most of them prudently determined to be satisfied with a room in
the attic story, or some of the side buildings.
They were now proceeding through the village, past the inn. Wilhelm stopped the coach, in the mind to alight
there; but the landlord protested that it was not in his power to afford the least accommodation: his lordship the
Count, he said, being visited by some unexpected guests, had immediately engaged the whole inn; every chamber
in the house had been marked with chalk last night, specifying who was to lodge there. Our friend was
accordingly obliged, against his will, to travel forward to the Castle, with the rest of the company.
In one of the side buildings, round the kitchen fire, they noticed several cooks running busily about; a sight which
refreshed them not a little. Servants came jumping hastily with lights to the staircase of the main−door; and the
hearts of the worthy pilgrims overflowed at the aspect of such honours. But how great was their surprise, when
this cordial reception changed into a storm of curses. The servants scouted the coachmen for driving in hither;
they must wheel out again, it was bawled, and take their loading round to the old Castle; there was no room here
for such guests! To this unfriendly and unexpected dismissal, they joined all manner of jeering, and laughed aloud
at each other for leaping out in the rain on so false an errand. It was still pouring; no star was visible in the sky;
while our company were dragged along a rough jolting road, between two walls, into the old mansion, which
stood behind, inhabited by none since the present Count's father had build the new residence in front of it. The
carriages drew up, partly in the courtyard, partly in a long arched gateway; and the postillions, people hired from
the village, unyoked their horses and rode off.
As nobody came forward to receive the travellers, they alighted from their places, they shouted, and searched. In
vain! All continued dark and still. The wind swept through the lofty gate; the court and the old towers were lying
gray and dreary, and so dim that their forms could scarcely be distinguished in the gloom. The people were all
shuddering and freezing; the women were becoming frightened; the children began to cry; the general impatience
Chapter III

78

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
was increasing every minute; so quick a revolution of fortune, for which no one of them had been at all prepared,
entirely destroyed their equanimity.
Expecting every minute that some person would appear and unbolt the doors; mistaking at one time the pattering
of rain, at another the rocking of the wind, for the much−desired footstep of the Castle Bailiff, they continued
downcast and inactive; it occurred to none of them to go into the new mansion, and there solicit help from
charitable souls. They could not understand where their friend the Baron was lingering; they were in the most
disconsolate condition.
At last some people actually arrived: by their voices, they were recognised as the pedestrians who had fallen
behind the others on the journey. They intimated that the Baron had tumbled with his horse, and hurt his leg
severely; and that on calling at the Castle, they too had been roughly directed hither.
The whole company were in extreme perplexity; they guessed and speculated as to what should now be done; but
they could fix on nothing. At length they noticed from afar a lantern advancing, and took fresh breath at sight of
it; but their hopes of quick deliverance again evaporated, when the object approached, and came to be distinctly
seen. A groom was lighting the well−known Stallmeister of the Castle towards them; this gentleman, on coming
nearer, very anxiously inquired for Mademoiselle Philina. No sooner had she stept forth from the crowd, than he
very pressingly offered to conduct her to the new mansion, where a little place had been provided for her with the
Countess's maids. She did not hesitate long about accepting his proposal; she caught his arm, and recommending
her trunk to the care of the rest, was going to hasten off with him directly; but the others intercepted them, asking,
entreating, conjuring the Stallmeister; till at last, to get away with his fair one, he promised everything, assuring
them that in a little while, the Castle should be opened, and they lodged in the most comfortable manner. In a few
moments, they saw the glimmer of his lantern vanish; they long looked in vain for another gleam of light. At last,
after much watching, scolding and reviling, it actually appeared, and revived them with a touch of hope and
consolation.
An ancient footman opened the door of the old edifice, into which they rushed with violence. Each of them now
strove to have his trunk unfastened, and brought in beside him. Most of this luggage, like the persons of its
owners, was thoroughly wetted. Having but a single light, the process of unpacking went on very slowly. In the
dark passages they pushed against each other, they stumbled, they fell. The begged to have more lights, they
begged to have some fuel. The monosyllabic footman, with much ado, consented to put down his own lantern;
then went his way, and came not again.
They now began to investigate the edifice. The doors of all the rooms were open; large stoves, tapestry hangings,
inlaid floors, yet bore witness to its former pomp; but of other house−gear there was none to be seen; no table,
chair, or mirror; nothing but a few monstrous empty bedsteads, stript of every ornament and every necessary. The
wet trunks and knapsacks were adopted as seats; a part of the tired wanderers placed themselves upon the floor.
Wilhelm had sat down upon some steps; Mignon lay upon his knees. The child was restless; and, when he asked
what ailed her, she answered: "I am hungry." He himself had nothing that could still the craving of the child; the
rest of the party had consumed their whole provision; so he was obliged to leave the little traveller without
refreshment. Through the whole adventure he had been inactive, silently immersed in thought. He was very
sullen, and full of indignant regret that he had not kept by his first determination, and remained at the inn, though
he should have slept in the garret.
The rest demeaned themselves in various ways. Some of them had got a heap of old wood collected within a vast
gaping chimney in the hall; they set fire to the pile with great huzzaing. Unhappily, however, their hopes of
warming and drying themselves by means of it, were mocked in the most frightful manner. The chimney, it
appeared, was there for ornament alone, and was walled−up above; so the smoke rushed quickly back, and at once
filled the whole chamber. The dry wood rose crackling into flames; the flame was also driven back; the draught
sweeping through the broken windows gave it a wavering direction. Terrified lest the Castle should catch fire, the
Chapter III

79

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
unhappy guests had to tear the burning sticks asunder to smother and trample them under their feet; the smoke
increased; their case was rendered more intolerable than before; they were driven to the brink of desperation.
Wilhelm had retreated from the smoke into a distant chamber; to which Mignon soon followed him, leading in a
well−dressed servant, with a high clear double−lighted lantern in his hand. He turned to Wilhelm, and holding out
to him some fruits and confectionery on a beautiful porcelain plate: "The young lady upstairs," said he, "sends
you this, with the request that you would join her party: she bids me tell you," added the lacquey, with a sort of
grin, "that she is very well off yonder, and wishes to divide her enjoyments with her friends."
Wilhelm had not at all expected such a message; for, ever since the adventure on the stone bench, he had treated
Philina with the most decided contempt: he was still so resolute to have no more concern with her, that he thought
of sending back her dainty gifts untasted, when a supplicating look of Mignon's induced him to accept them. He
returned his thanks in the name of the child. The invitation he entirely rejected. He desired the servant to exert
himself a little for the stranger company, and made inquiry for the Baron. The latter, he was told, had gone to bed;
but had already, as the lacquey understood, given orders to some other person to take charge of these unfortunate
and ill−lodged gentlemen.
The servant went away, leaving one of his lights, which Wilhelm, in the absence of a candlestick, contrived to fix
upon the window casement; and now at least, in his meditations, he could see the four walls of his chamber. Nor
was it long till preparations were commenced for conducting our travellers to rest. Candles arrived by degrees,
though without snuffers; then a few chairs; an hour afterwards came bed−clothes; then pillows, all well steeped in
rain. It was far past midnight when straw−beds and mattresses were produced, which, if sent at first, would have
been extremely welcome.
In the interim also, somewhat to eat and drink had been brought in: it was enjoyed without much criticism, though
it looked like a most disorderly collection of remains, and offered no very singular proof of the esteem in which
our guests were held.

Chapter IV
THE DISORDERS and mischievous tricks of some frolick−some companions still farther augmented the
disquietudes and distresses of the night: these gay people woke each other, each played a thousand giddy pranks
to plague his fellow. The next morning dawned amid loud complaints against their friend the Baron, for having so
deceived them, for having given so very false a notion of the order and comfort that awaited their arrival.
However, to their great surprise and consolation, at an early hour, the Count himself, attended by a few servants,
made his entrance, and inquired about their circumstances. He appeared much vexed on discovering how badly
they had fared, and the Baron, who came limping along, supported on the arm of a servant, bitterly accused the
Steward for neglecting his commands on this occasion; showing great anxiety to have that person punished for his
disobedience.
The Count gave immediate orders that everything should be arranged, in his presence, to the utmost possible
convenience of the guests. While this was going on, some officers arrived, who forthwith scraped acquaintance
with the actresses. The Count assembled all the company before him, spoke to each by name, introduced a few
jokes among his observations; so that every one was charmed at the gracious condescension of his Lordship. At
last it came to Wilhelm's turn; he appeared with Mignon holding by his hand. Our friend excused himself, in the
best terms he could, for the freedom he had taken; the Count, on the other hand, spoke as if the visit had been
looked for.
A gentleman, who stood beside the Count, and who, although he wore no uniform, appeared to be an officer,
conversed with Wilhelm; he was evidently not a common man. His large keen blue eyes, looking out from
Chapter IV

80

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
beneath a high brow; his light−coloured hair, thrown carelessly back; his middle stature; everything about him
showed an active, firm and decisive mode of being. His questions were lively; he seemed to be at home in all that
he inquired about.
Wilhelm asked the Baron what this person was; but found that he had little good to say of him. "He held the rank
of Major, was the special favourite of the Prince, managed his most secret affairs, was, in short, regarded as his
right arm. Nay, there was reason to believe him the Prince's natural son. He had been on embassies in France,
England, Italy; in all those places he had greatly distinguished himself; by which means he was grown conceited,
imagining, among other pretensions, that he thoroughly understood the literature of Germany, and allowing
himself to vent all kinds of sorry jests upon it. He, the Baron, was in the habit of avoiding all intercourse with
him; and Wilhelm would do well to imitate that conduct, for it somehow happened that no one could be near him
without being punished for it. He was called Jarno; though nobody knew rightly what to make of such a name."
Wilhelm had nothing to urge against all this: he had felt a sort of inclination for the stranger, though he noticed in
him something cold and repulsive.
The company being arranged and distributed throughout the Castle, Melina issued the strictest orders, that they
should behave themselves with decency; the women live in a separate quarter; and each direct his whole attention
to the study of dramatic art, and of the characters he had to play. He posted up written ordinances, consisting of
many articles, upon all the doors. He settled the amount of fine, which should be levied upon each transgressor,
and put into a common box.
This edict was but little heeded. Young officers went out and in; they jested not in the most modest fashion with
the actresses; made game of the actors; and annihilated the whole system of police, before it had the smallest time
to take root in the community. The people ran chasing one another through the rooms, they changed clothes, they
disguised themselves. Melina, attempting to be rigorous with a few at first, was exasperated by every sort of
insolence; and when the Count soon after sent for him to come and view the place where his theatre was to be
erected, matters grew worse and worse. The young gentry devised a thousand broad jokes; by the help of some
actors, they became yet coarser; it seemed as if the old Castle had been altogether given up to an infuriate host;
and the racket did not end till dinner.
Meanwhile the Count had led Melina over to a large hall, which, though belonging to the old Castle,
communicated by a gallery with the new one: it seemed very well adapted for being changed into a little theatre.
Here the sagacious lord of the mansion pointed out in person how he wanted everything to be.
The labour now commenced in the greatest haste; the stage−apparatus was erected and furbished up; what
decorations they had brought along with them and could employ, were set in order; and what was wanting, was
prepared by some skilful workmen of the Count's. Wilhelm likewise put his hand to the business; he assisted in
settling the perspective, in laying off the outlines of the scenery; he was very anxious that nothing should be
executed clumsily. The Count, who frequently came in to inspect their progress, was highly satisfied; he showed
particularly how they should proceed in every case, displaying an uncommon knowledge of all the arts they were
concerned with.
Next began the business of rehearsing, in good earnest, and there would have been enough of space and leisure for
this undertaking, had the actors not continually been interrupted by the presence of visitors. Some new guests
were daily arriving, and each insisted on viewing the operations of the company.

Chapter V
THE BARON had, for several days, been cheering Wilhelm with the hope of being formally presented to the
Chapter V

81

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Countess. "I have told this excellent lady," said he, "so much about the talent and fine sentiment displayed in your
compositions, that she feels quite impatient to see you, and hear one or two of them read. Be prepared, therefore,
to come over at a moment's notice; for, the first morning she is at leisure, you will certainly be called on." He then
pointed out to him the afterpiece it would be proper to produce on that occasion; adding, that doubtless it would
recommend him to no usual degree of favour. The lady, he declared, was extremely sorry that a guest like him had
happened to arrive at a time of such confusion, when they could not entertain him in a style more suitable to his
merits and their own wishes.
In consequence of this information, Wilhelm, with the most sedulous attention, set about preparing the piece,
which was to usher him into the great world. "Hitherto," said he, "thou hast laboured in silence for thyself;
applauded only by a small circle of friends. Thou hast for a time despaired of thy abilities, and art yet full of
anxious doubts whether even thy present path is the right one, and whether thy talent for the stage at all
corresponds with thy inclination for it. In the hearing of such practised judges, in the closet where no illusion can
take place, the attempt is far more hazardous than elsewhere; and yet I would not willingly recoil from the
experiment; I could wish to add this pleasure to my former enjoyments, and if it might be, to give extension and
stability to my hopes from the future."
He accordingly went through some pieces; read them with the keenest critical eye; made corrections here and
there; recited them aloud, that he might be perfect in his tones and expression: and finally selected the work,
which he was best acquainted with, and hoped to gain most honour by. He put it in his pocket, one morning, on
being summoned to attend the Countess.
The Baron had assured him that there would be no one present, but the lady herself and a worthy female friend of
hers. On entering the chamber, the Baroness von C advanced with great friendliness to meet him; expressed her
happiness at making his acquaintance; and introduced him to the Countess, who was then under the hands of her
hairdresser. The Countess received him with kind words and looks; but it vexed him to see Philina kneeling at her
chair, and playing a thousand fooleries. "The poor child," said the Baroness, "has just been singing to us. Finish
the song you were in the midst of; we should not like to lose it."
Wilhelm listened to her quavering with great patience, being anxious for the friseur's departure before he should
begin to read. They offered him a cup of chocolate, the Baroness herself handing him the biscuit. Yet, in spite of
these civilities, he relished not his breakfast; he was longing too eagerly to lay before the lovely Countess some
performance t hat might interest and gratify her. Philina too stood somewhat in his way; on former occasions,
while listening to him, she had more than once been troublesome. He looked at the friseur with a painful feeling,
hoping every moment that the tower of curls would be complete.
Meanwhile the Count came in, and began to talk of the fresh visitors he was expecting, of the day's occupations or
amusements, and of various domestic matters that were started. On his retiring, some officers sent to ask
permission of the Countess to pay their respects to her, as they had to leave the Castle before dinner. The footman
having come to his post at the door, she permitted him to usher in the gentlemen.
The Baroness amid these interruptions gave herself some pains to entertain our friend, and showed him much
consideration; all which he accepted with becoming reverence, though not without a little absence of mind. He
often felt for the manuscript in his pocket; and hoped for his deliverance every instant. He was almost losing
patience, when a man−milliner was introduced, and immediately began without mercy to open his papers, bags
and bandboxes; pressing all his various wares upon the ladies, with an importunity peculiar to that species of
creature.
The company increased. The Baroness cast a look at Wilhelm, and then whispered with the Countess: he noticed
this, but did not understand the purpose of it. The whole, however, became clear enough, when, after an hour of
painful and fruitless endurance, he went away. He then found a beautiful pocket−book, of English manufacture, in
Chapter V

82

his pocket. The Baroness had dextrously put it there without his notice; and soon afterwards the Countess's little
Black came out, and handed him an elegantly flowered waistcoat, without very clearly saying whence it came.

Chapter VI
THIS mingled feeling of vexation and gratitude spoiled the remainder of his day; till, towards evening, he once
more found employment. Melina informed him that the Count had been speaking of a little prelude, which he
wished to have produced, in honour of the Prince, on the day of his Highness's arrival. He meant to have the great
qualities of this noble hero and philanthropist personified in the piece. These Virtues were to advance together, to
recite his praises, and finally to encircle his bust with garlands of flowers and laurels; behind which a
transparency might be inserted, representing the princely Hat, and his name illuminated on it. The Count, Melina
said, had ordered him to take charge of getting ready the verses and other arrangements; and Wilhelm, he hoped,
to whom it must be an easy matter, would stand by him on this occasion.
"How!" exclaimed our friend in a splenetic tone, "have we nothing but portraits, illuminated names and
allegorical figures, to show in honour of a Prince, who, in my opinion, merits quite a different eulogy? How can it
flatter any reasonable man to see himself set up in effigy, and his name glimmering on oiled paper! I am very
much afraid that your Allegories, particularly in the present state of the wardrobe, will furnish occasion for many
ambiguities and jestings. If you mean, however, to compose the piece, or make it be composed, I can have
nothing to object against it; only I desire to have no part or lot in the matter."
Melina excused himself; alleging this to be only a casual hint of his Lordship the Count, who for the rest had left
the arrangement of the piece entirely in their own hands. "With all my heart," replied our friend, "will I contribute
something to the pleasure of this noble family; my Muse has never had so pleasant an employment as to sing,
though in broken numbers, the praises of a Prince who merits so much veneration. I will think of the matter;
perhaps I may be able to contrive some way of bringing out our little troop, so as at least to produce some effect."
From this moment, Wilhelm eagerly reflected on his undertaking. Before going to sleep, he had got it all reduced
to some degree of order; early next morning his plan was ready, the scenes laid out; a few of the most striking
passages and songs were even versified and written down.
As soon as he was dressed, our friend made haste to wait upon the Baron, to submit the plan to his inspection, and
take his advice upon certain points connected with it. The Baron testified his approbation of it; but not without
considerable surprise. For, on the previous evening, he had heard his Lordship talk of having ordered some quite
different piece to be prepared and versified.
"To me it seems improbable," replied our friend, "that it could be his Lordship's wish to have the piece got ready,
exactly as he gave it to Melina. If I am not mistaken, he intended merely to point out to us from a distance the
path we were to follow. The amateur and critic shows the artist what is wanted; and then leaves to him the care of
producing it by his own means."
"Not at all," replied the Baron; "his Lordship understands that the piece shall be composed according to that and
no other plan, which he has himself prescribed. Yours has indeed a remote similarity with his idea; but, if we
mean to accomplish our purpose, and get the Count diverted from his first thought, we shall need to employ the
ladies in the matter. The Baroness especially contrives to execute such operations in the most masterly manner:
the question is now, whether your plan shall so please her, that she will undertake the business; in that case it will
certainly succeed."
"We need the assistance of the ladies," said our friend, "at any rate; for neither our company nor our wardrobe
would suffice without them. I have counted on some pretty children, that are running up and down the house, and
Chapter VI

83

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
belong to certain of the servants."
He then desired the Baron to communicate his plan to the ladies. The Baron soon returned with intelligence that
they wished to speak with Wilhelm personally. That same evening, when the gentlemen sat down to play, which,
owing to the arrival of a certain General, was expected to be deeper and keener than usual, the Countess and her
friend, under pretext of some indisposition, would retire to their chamber; where Wilhelm, being introduced by a
secret staircase, might submit his project without interruption. This sort of mystery, the Baron said, would give
the adventure a peculiar charm; in particular the Baroness was rejoicing like a child, in the prospect of their
rendezvous; and the more so, because it was to be accomplished secretly and against the inclination of the Count.
Towards evening, at the appointed time, Wilhelm was sent for, and led in with caution. As the Baroness advanced
to meet him in a small cabinet, the manner of their interview brought former happy scenes, for a moment, to his
mind. She conducted him along to the Countess's chamber; and they now proceeded earnestly to question and
investigate. He exhibited his plan with the utmost warmth and vivacity; so that his fair audience were quite
decided in its favour. Our readers also will permit us to present a brief sketch of it here.
The piece was to open with a dance of children in some rural scene; their dance representing that particular game,
wherein each has to wheel round and gain the other's place. This was to be followed by several variations of their
play; till at last, in performing a dance of the repeating kind, they were all to sing a merry song. Here the old
Harper with Mignon should enter, and by the curiosity which they excited, gather several country people round
them; the Harper would sing various songs in praise of peace, repose and joy; and Mignon would then dance the
egg−dance.
In these innocent delights, they are disturbed by the sound of martial music; and the party are surprised by a troop
of soldiers. The men stand on the defensive, and are overcome; the girls fly, and are taken. In the tumult all seems
going to destruction, when a Person (about whose form and qualities the poet was not yet determined) enters, and
by signifying that the General is near, restores composure. Whereupon the Hero's character is painted in the finest
colours; security is promised in the midst of arms; violence and lawless disorder are now to be restrained. A
universal festival is held in honour of the noble−minded Captain.
The Countess and her friend expressed great satisfaction with the plan; only they maintained that there must of
necessity be something of allegory introduced, to make it palatable to his Lordship. The Baron proposed that the
leader of the soldiers should be represented as the Genius of Dissension and Violence; that Minerva should then
advance to bind fetters on him, to give notice of the hero's approach, and celebrate his praise. The Baroness
undertook the task of persuading the Count, that this plan was the one proposed by himself with a few alterations;
at the same time expressly stipulating that, without fail, at the conclusion of the piece the bust, the illuminated
name, and the princely Hat, should be exhibited in due order; since otherwise her attempt was vain.
Wilhelm had already figured in his mind how delicately and how nobly he would have the praises of his hero
celebrated in the mouth of Minerva; and it was not without a long struggle that he yielded in this point. Yet he felt
himself delightfully constrained to yield, The beautiful eyes of the Countess, and her lovely demeanour, would
easily have moved him to sin against his conscience as a poet; to abandon the finest and most interesting
invention, the keenly wished−for unity of his composition, and all its most suitable details. His conscience as a
burgher had a trial no less hard to undergo, when the ladies, in distributing the characters, pointedly insisted that
he must undertake one himself.
Laertes had received for his allotment the part of that violent war−god; Wilhelm was to represent the leader of the
peasants, who had some very pretty and tender verses to recite. After long resistance he was forced to comply: he
could find no excuse, when the Baroness protested that their stage was in all respects to be regarded as a private
one, and that she herself would very gladly play on it, if they could find her a fit occasion. On receiving his
consent, they parted with our friend on the kindest terms. The Baroness assured him that he was an incomparable
Chapter VI

84

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
man; she accompanied him to the little stairs, and wished him good−night with a squeeze of the hand.

Chapter VII
THE INTEREST in his undertakings, which the Countess and her friend expressed and felt so warmly, quickened
Wilhelm's faculties and zeal: the plan of his piece, which the process of describing it had rendered more distinct,
was now present in the most brilliant vividness before his mind. He spent the greater part of that night, and the
whole of next morning, in the sedulous versification of the dialogue and songs.
He had proceeded a considerable way, when a message came requiring his attendance in the Castle; the noble
company, who were then at breakfast, wished to speak with him. As he entered the parlour, the Baroness
advanced to meet him; and, under pretext of wishing him good−morning, whispered cunningly: "Say nothing of
your piece, but what you shall be asked."
"I hear," cried the Count to him, "that you are very busy working at my prelude, which I mean to present in
honour of the Prince. I consent that you introduce a Minerva into it; and we are just thinking beforehand how the
goddess shall be dressed, that we may not blunder in costume. For this purpose I am causing them to fetch from
the library all the books that contain any figures of her."
At the same instant, one or two servants entered the parlour, with a huge basket full of books of every shape and
appearance.
Montfaucon, the collections of antique statues, gems and coins, all sorts of mythological writings, were turned up,
and their plates compared. But even this was not enough. The Count's faithful memory recalled to him all the
Minervas to be found in frontispieces, vignettes, or anywhere else; and book after book was, in consequence,
carried from the library, till finally the Count was sitting in a chaos of volumes. Unable at last to recollect any
other figure of Minerva, he observed with a smile: "I durst bet, that now there is not a single Minerva in all the
library; and perhaps it is the first time that a collection of books has been so totally deprived of the presence of its
patron goddess."
The whole company were merry at this thought; Jarno particularly, who all along been spurring on the Count to
call for more and more books, laughed quite immoderately.
"Now," said the Count, turning to Wilhelm, "one chief point is: Which goddess do you mean? Minerva or Pallas?
The goddess of war or of the arts?"
"Would it not be best, your Excellency," said Wilhelm, "if we were not clearly to express ourselves on this head;
if since the goddess plays a double part in the ancient mythology, we also exhibited her here in a double quality?
She announces a warrior, but only to calm the tumults of the people; she celebrates a hero by exalting his
humanity; she conquers violence, and restores peace and security."
The Baroness, afraid lest Wilhelm might betray himself, hastily pushed forward the Countess's tailor, to give his
opinion how such an antique robe could best be got ready. This man, being frequently employed in making
masquerade dresses, very easily contrived the business; and as Madam Melina, notwithstanding her advanced
state of pregnancy, had undertaken to enact the celestial virgin, the tailor was directed to take her measure: and
the Countess, though with some reluctance, selected from the wardrobe the clothes he was to cut up for that
purpose.
The Baroness, in her dextrous way, again contrived to lead Wilhelm aside, and let him know that she had been
providing all the other necessaries. Shortly afterwards, she sent him the musician, who had charge of the Count's
Chapter VII

85

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
private band; and this professor set about composing what airs were wanted, or choosing from his actual stock
such tunes as appeared suitable. From this time, all went on according to the wishes of our friend: the Count made
no more inquiries about the piece; being altogether occupied with the transparent decoration, destined to surprise
the spectators at the conclusion of the play. His inventive genius, aided by the skill of his confectioner, produced
in fact a very pretty article. In the course of his travels, the Count had witnessed the most splendid exhibitions of
this sort; he had also brought home with him a number of copper−plates and drawings, and could sketch such
things with considerable taste.
Meanwhile Wilhelm finished the play; gave every one his part, and began the study of his own. The musician
also, having great skill in dancing, prepared the ballet; so that everything proceeded as it ought.
Yet one unexpected obstacle occurred, which threatened to occasion an unpleasant gap in the performance. He
had promised to himself a striking effect from Mignon's egg dance; and was much surprised when the child, with
her customary dryness of manner refused to dance, saying she was now his, and would no more go upon the stage.
He sought to move her by every sort of persuasion, and did not discontinue his attempt till she began weeping
bitterly, fell at his feet, and cried out, "Dearest father! stay thou from the boards thyself!" Little heeding this
caution, he studied how to give the scene some other turn that might be equally interesting.
Philina, whose appointment was to act one of the peasant girls, and in the concluding dance to give the
single−voice part of the song, and lead the chorus, felt exceedingly delighted that it had been so ordered. In other
respects too, her present life was altogether to her mind; she had her separate chamber; was constantly beside the
Countess, entertaining her with fooleries, and daily receiving some present for her pains. Among other things, a
dress had been expressly made for her wearing in this prelude. And being of a light imitative nature, she quickly
marked in the procedure of the ladies whatever would befit herself: she had of late grown all politeness and
decorum. The attentions of the Stallmeister augmented rather than diminished; and, as the officers also paid
zealous court to her, living in so genial an element, it came into her head for once in her life to play the prude,
and, in a quiet gradual way, to take upon herself a certain dignity of manner to which she had not before aspired.
Cool and sharp−sighted as she was, eight days had not elapsed till she knew the weak side of every person in the
house; so that, had she possessed the power of acting from any constant motive, she might very easily have made
her fortune. But on this occasion, as on all others, she employed her advantages merely to divert herself, to
procure a bright today, and be impertinent, wherever she observed that impertinence was not attended with
danger.
The parts were now committed to memory; a rehearsal of the piece was ordered; the Count purposed to be present
at it; and his lady began to feel anxious how he might receive it. The Baroness called Wilhelm to her privately:
the nearer the hour approached, they all displayed the more perplexity; for the truth was, that of the Count's
original idea nothing whatever had been introduced. Jarno, who joined them while consulting together, was
admitted to the secret. He felt amused at the contrivance, and was heartily disposed to offer the ladies his good
services in carrying it through. "It will go hard," said he, "if you cannot extricate yourselves without help from
this affair; but, at all events, I will wait as a body of reserve." The Baroness then told them how she had on
various occasions recited the whole piece to the Count, but only in fragments and without order; that consequently
he was prepared for each individual passage, yet certainly possessed with the idea that the whole would coincide
with his original conception. "I will sit by him," she said, "tonight at the rehearsal, and study to divert his
attention. The confectioner I have engaged already to make the decoration as beautiful as possible, but as yet he
has not quite completed it."
"I know of a Court," said Jarno, "where I wish we had a few such active and prudent friends as you. If your skill
tonight will not suffice, give me a signal; I will take out the Count, and not let him in again till Minerva enter, and
you have speedy aid to expect from the illumination. For a day or two, I have had something to report to him
about his cousin, which for various reasons I have hitherto postponed. It will give his thoughts another turn, and
that none of the pleasantest."
Chapter VII

86

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Business hindered the Count from being present when the play began; the Baroness amused him after his arrival;
Jarno's help was not required. For, as the Count had abundance of employment in pointing out improvements,
rectifying and arranging the detached parts, he entirely forgot the purport of the whole; and as at last Madam
Melina advanced and spoke according to his heart, and the transparency did well, he seemed completely satisfied.
It was not till the whole was finished, and his guests were sitting down to cards, that the difference appeared to
strike him, and he began to think whether after all this piece was actually of his invention. At a signal from the
Baroness, Jarno then came forward into action; the evening passed away; the intelligence of the Prince's approach
was confirmed; the people rode out more than once to see his vanguard encamping in the neighbourhood; the
house was full of noise and tumult; and our actors, not always served in the handsomest manner by unwilling
servants, had to pass their time in practisings and expectations, at their quarters in the old mansion, without any
one particularly taking thought about them.

Chapter VIII
AT length the Prince arrived, with all his generals, staff−officers and suite accompanying him. These, and the
multitude of people coming to visit or do business with him, made the castle like a bee−hive on the point of
swarming. All pressed forward to behold a man no less distinguished by his rank than by his great qualities; and
all admired his urbanity and condescension; all were astonished at finding the hero and the leader of armies also
the most accomplished and attractive courtier.
By the Count's orders, the inmates of the Castle were required to be all at their posts when the Prince arrived; not
a player was allowed to show himself, that his Highness might have no anticipation of the spectacle prepared to
welcome him. Accordingly, when at evening he was led into the lofty hall, glowing with light, and adorned with
tapestries of the previous century, he seemed not at all prepared to expect a play, and still less a prelude in honour
of himself. Everything went off as it should have done: at the conclusion of the show, the whole troop were called
and presented individually to the Prince, who contrived with the most pleasing and friendly air to put some
question, or make some remark, to every one of them. Wilhelm, as author of the piece, was particularly noticed,
and had his tribute of applause liberally paid him.
The prelude being fairly over, no one asked another word about it; in a few days, it was as if it never had existed,
except that occasionally Jarno spoke of it to Wilhelm, judiciously praised it, adding however: "It is pity you
should play with hollow nuts, for a stake of hollow nuts." This expression stuck in Wilhelm's mind for several
days; he knew not how to explain it, or what to infer from it.
Meanwhile the company kept acting every night, as well as their capacities permitted; each doing his utmost to
attract the attention of spectators. Undeserved applauses cheered them on: in their old Castle they fully believed
that the great assemblage was crowding thither solely on their account; that the multitude of strangers was allured
by their exhibitions; that they were the centre round which, and by means of which, the whole was moving and
revolving.
Wilhelm alone, discovered, to his sorrow, that directly the reverse was true. For although the Prince had waited
out the first exhibitions, sitting on his chair, with the greatest conscientiousness, yet by degrees he grew remiss in
his attendance, and seized every plausible occasion of withdrawing. And those very people whom Wilhelm, in
conversation, had found to be the best informed and most sensible, with Jarno at their head, were wont to spend
but a few transitory moments in the hall of the theatre; sitting for the rest of their time in the ante−chamber,
gaming, or seeming to employ themselves in business.
Amid all his persevering efforts, to want the wished and hoped−for approbation grieved Wilhelm very deeply. In
the choice of plays, in transcribing the parts, in numerous rehearsals, and whatever farther could be done, he
zealously coöperated with Melina, who, being in secret conscious of his own insufficiency, at length
Chapter VIII

87

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
acknowledged and pursued these counsels. His own parts Wilhelm diligently studied; and executed with vivacity
and feeling, and with all the propriety which the little training he had yet received would allow.
At the same time, the unwearied interest which the Baron took in their performances, obliterated every doubt from
the minds of the rest of the company: he assured them that their exhibitions were producing the deepest effect,
especially while one of his own pieces had been representing; only he was grieved to say, the Prince showed an
exclusive inclination for the French theatre; while a part of his people, among whom Jarno was especially
distinguished, gave a passionate preference to the monstrous productions of the English stage.
If in this way the art of our players was not adequately noticed and admired, their persons, on the other hand,
grew not entirely indifferent to all the gentlemen and all the ladies of the audience. We observed above, that from
the very first our actresses had drawn upon them the attention of the young officers; in the sequel they were
luckier, and made more important conquests. But omitting these, we shall merely observe, that Wilhelm every day
appeared more interesting to the Countess, while in him too a silent inclination towards her was beginning to take
root. Whenever he was on the stage, she could not turn her eyes from him; and ere long he seemed to play and to
recite with his face towards her alone. To look upon each other was to them the sweetest satisfaction; to which
their harmless souls yielded without reserve, without cherishing a bolder wish, or thinking about any
consequence.
As two hostile outposts will sometimes peacefully and pleasantly converse together, across the river which
divides them, not thinking of the war in which both their countries are engaged, so did the Countess exchange
looks full of meaning with our friend, across the vast chasm of birth and rank, both believing for themselves that
they might safely cherish their several emotions.
The Baroness, in the meantime, had selected Laertes, who, being a spirited and lively young man, pleased her
very much; and who, woman−hater as he was, felt unwilling to refuse a passing adventure. He would actually on
this occasion have been fettered, against his will, by the courteous and attractive nature of the Baroness, had not
the Baron done him accidentally a piece of good, or if you will, of bad service, by instructing him a little in the
habits and temper of this lady.
Laertes happening once to celebrate her praises, and give her the preference to every other of her sex, the Baron
with a grin replied: "I see how matters stand; our fair friend has got a fresh inmate for her stalls." This luckless
comparison, which pointed too clearly to the dangerous caresses of a Circe, grieved poor Laertes to the heart; he
could not listen to the Baron without spite and anger, as the latter continued without mercy:
"Every stranger thinks he is the first, whom this delightful manner of proceeding has concerned; but he is
grievously mistaken; for we have all, at one time or another, been trotted round this course. Man, youth, or boy,
be who he like, each must devote himself to her service for a season, must hang about her, and toil and long to
gain her favour."
To the happy man, just entering the garden of an enchantress, and welcomed by all the pleasures of an artificial
spring, nothing can form a more unpleasant surprise, than if, while his ear is watching and drinking−in the music
of the nightingales, some transformed predecessor on a sudden grunts at his feet.
After this discovery, Laertes felt heartily ashamed, that vanity should have again misled him to think well, even in
the smallest degree, of any woman whatsoever. He now entirely forsook the Baroness; kept by the Stallmeister,
with whom he diligently fenced and hunted; conducting himself at rehearsals and representations as if these were
but secondary matters.
The Count and his lady would often in the mornings send for some of the company to attend them; and all had
continual cause to envy the undeserved good fortune of Philina. The Count kept his favourite, the Pedant,
Chapter VIII

88

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
frequently for hours together, at his toilette. This genius had been dressed−out by degrees; he was now equipt and
furnished even to watch and snuff−box.
Many times, too, particularly after dinner, the whole company were called out before the noble guests; an honour
which the artists regarded as the most flattering in the world; not observing, that on these very occasions the
servants and huntsmen were ordered to bring in a multitude of hounds, and to lead strings of horses about the
court of the Castle.
Wilhelm had been counselled to praise Racine, the Prince's favourite, and thereby to attract some portion of his
Highness's favour to himself. On one of these afternoons, being summoned with the rest, he found an opportunity
to introduce this topic. The Prince asked him if he diligently read the great French dramatic writers; to which
Wilhelm answered with a very eager "Yes." He did not observe that his Highness, without waiting for the answer,
was already on the point of turning round to some one else: he fixed upon him, on the contrary, almost stepping in
his way; and proceeded to declare, that he valued the French theatre very highly, and read the works of their great
masters with delight; particularly he had learned with true joy that his Highness did complete justice to the great
talents of Racine. "I can easily conceive," continued he, "how people of high breeding and exalted rank must
value a poet, who has painted so excellently and so truly the circumstances of their lofty station. Corneille, if I
may say so, has delineated great men; Racine men of eminent rank. In reading his plays, I can always figure to
myself the poet as living at a splendid court, with a great king before his eyes, in constant intercourse with the
most distinguished persons, and penetrating into the secrets of human nature, as it works concealed behind the
gorgeous tapestry of palaces. When I study his Britannicus, his Berenice, it seems as if I were transported in
person to the court, were initiated into the great and the little, in the habitations of these earthly gods; through the
fine and delicate organs of my author, I see kings whom a nation adores, courtiers whom thousands envy, in their
natural forms, with their failings and their pains. The anecdote of Racine's dying of a broken heart, because Louis
Fourteenth would no longer attend to him, and had shown him his dissatisfaction, is to me the key to all his
works. It was impossible that a poet of his talents, whose life and death depended on the looks of a king, should
not write such works as a king and a prince might applaud."
Jarno had stept near, and was listening with astonishment. The Prince, who had made no answer, and had only
shown his approbation by an assenting look, now turned aside; though Wilhelm, who did not know that it was
contrary to etiquette to continue a discussion under such circumstances and exhaust a subject, would gladly have
spoken more, and convinced the Prince that he had not read his favourite poet without sensibility and profit.
"Have you never," said Jarno, taking him aside, "read one of Shakspeare's plays?"
"No," replied Wilhelm: "since the time when they became more known in Germany, I have myself grown
unacquainted with the theatre; and I know not whether I should now rejoice that an old taste, and occupation of
my youth, has been by chance renewed. In the mean time, all that I have heard of these plays has excited little
wish to become acquainted with such extraordinary monsters, which appear to set probability and dignity alike at
defiance."
"I would advise you," said the other, "to make a trial, notwithstanding: it can do one no harm to look at what is
extraordinary with one's own eyes. I will lend you a volume or two; and you cannot better spend your time, than
by casting everything aside, and retiring to the solitude of your old habitation, to look into the magic−lantern of
that unknown world. It is sinful of you to waste your hours in dressing−out these apes to look more human, and
teaching dogs to dance. One thing only I require; you must not cavil at the form; the rest I can leave to your own
good sense and feeling."
The horses were standing at the door; and Jarno mounted with some other cavaliers, to go and hunt. Wilhelm
looked after him with sadness. He would fain have spoken much with his man, who, though in a harsh unfriendly
way, gave him new ideas, ideas that he had need of.
Chapter VIII

Oftentimes a man when approaching some development of his powers, capacities and conceptions, gets into a
perplexity, from which a prudent friend might easily deliver him. He resembles a traveller, who, at but a short
distance from the inn he is to rest at, falls into the water; were any one to catch him then, and pull him to the bank,
with one good wetting it were over; whereas though he struggles out himself, it is often at the side where he
tumbled in, and he has to make a wide and weary circuit before reaching his appointed object.
Wilhelm now began to have an inkling that things went forward in the world differently from what he had
supposed. He now viewed close at hand the solemn and imposing life of the great and distinguished; and
wondered at the easy dignity which they contrived to give it. An army on its march, a princely hero at the head of
it, such a multitude of coöperating warriors, such a multitude of crowding worshippers, exalted his imagination.
In this mood, he received the promised books; and ere long, as may be easily supposed, the stream of that mighty
genius laid hold of him, and led him down to a shoreless ocean, where he soon completely forgot and lost himself.

Chapter IX
THE CONNEXION between the Baron and the actors had suffered various changes, since the arrival of the latter.
At the commencement, it had been productive of great satisfaction to both parties. As the Baron for the first time
in his life now saw one of those pieces, with which he had already graced a private theatre, put into the hands of
real actors, and in the fair way for a decent exhibition, he showed the benignest humour in the world. He was
liberal in gifts; he bought little presents for the actresses from every millinery−hawker, and contrived to send over
many an odd bottle of champagne to the actors. In return for all this, our company took every sort of trouble with
his play; and Wilhelm spared no diligence in learning, with extreme correctness, the sublime speeches of that very
eminent hero, whose part had fallen to his share.
But, in spite of all these kind reciprocities, some clouds by degrees arose between the players and their patron.
The Baron's preference for certain actors became daily more observable; this of necessity chagrined the rest. He
exalted his favourites quite exclusively; and thus, of course, he introduced disunion and jealousy among the
company. Melina, without skill to help himself in dubious junctures, felt his situation very vexing. The persons
eulogised accepted of their praise, without being singularly thankful for it; while the neglected gentlemen showed
traces of their spleen by a thousand methods; and constantly found mean to make it very disagreeable for their
once much−honoured patron to appear among them. Their spite received no little nourishment from a certain
poem, by an unknown author, which made a great sensation in the Castle. Previous to this, the Baron's intercourse
with the company had given rise to many little strokes of merriment; several stories had been raised about him;
certain little incidents, adorned with suitable additions, and presented in the proper light, had been talked of, and
made the subject of much bantering and laughter. At last it began to be said, that a certain rivalry of trade was
arising between him and some of the actors, who also looked upon themselves as writers. The poem we spoke of
was founded upon this report; it ran as follows: I poor devil, Lord Baron,Must envy you your crest of arms,The
coach you ride in, coat you've on,Your copses, ponds, and rack−rent farms,Your father's polish'd ashlar
house,And all his hounds and hares and grouse. Me poor devil, Lord Baron,You envy my small shred of
wit;Because it seems, as things have gone,Old Nature had a hand in it;She made me light of heart and gay,With
long−necked purse, not brain of clay. Look you now, dear Lord Baron,What if we both should cease to fret,You
being his Lordship's eldest son,And I being mother Nature's brat?We live in peace, all envy chase,And heed not
which o' th' two surpasses;I in the Herald's Books no place,You having none about Parnassus.
Upon this poem, which various persons were possessed of, in copies scarcely legible, opinions were exceedingly
divided. But who the author was, no one could guess; and as some began to draw a spiteful mirth from it, our
friend expressed himself against it very keenly.
"We Germans," he exclaimed, "deserve to have our Muses still continue in the low contempt wherein they have
languished so long; since we cannot value men of rank who take a share in our literature, no matter how. Birth,
Chapter IX

rank and fortune are nowise incompatible with genius and taste; as foreign nations, reckoning among their best
minds a great number of noblemen, can fully testify. Hitherto indeed it has been rare in Germany for men of high
station to devote themselves to science; hitherto few famous names have become more famous by their love of art
and learning; while many, on the other hand, have mounted out of darkness to distinction, and risen like unknown
stars on the horizon. Yet such will not always be the case; and I greatly err, if the first classes of the nation are not
even now in the way of also employing their advantages to earn the fairest laurels of the Muses, at no distant date.
Nothing, therefore, grieves me more than to see the burgher jeering at the noble who can value literature; nay
even men of rank themselves, with inconsiderate caprice, maliciously scaring off their equal from a path where
honour and contentment wait on all."
Apparently this latter observation pointed at the Count, of whom Wilhelm had heard that he liked the poem very
much. In truth, this nobleman, accustomed to rally the Baron in his own peculiar way, was extremely glad of such
an opportunity to plague his kinsman more effectually. As to who the writer of the squib might be, each formed
his own hypothesis; and the Count, never willing that another should surpass him in acuteness, fell upon a
thought, which, in a short time, he would have sworn to the truth of. The verses could be written, he believed, by
no one but his Pedant, who was a very shrewd knave, and in whom, for a long while, he had noticed some touches
of poetic genius. By way of proper treat, he therefore caused the Pedant one morning to be sent for, and made him
read the poem, in his own manner, in presence of the Countess, the Baroness and Jarno; a service he was paid for
by applauses, praises and a present: and on the Count's inquiring if he had not still some other poems of an earlier
time, he cunningly contrived to evade the question. Thus did the Pedant get invested with the reputation of a poet
and a wit; and in the eyes of the Baron's friends, of a pasquinader and a bad−hearted man. From that period, play
as he might, the Count applauded him with greater zeal than ever; so that the poor wight grew at last inflated till
he nearly lost his senses, and began to meditate having a chamber in the Castle like Philina.
Had this project been fulfilled at once, a great mishap might have been spared him. As he was returning late one
evening from the Castle, groping about in the dark narrow way, he was suddenly laid hold of, and kept on the spot
by some persons, while some others rained a shower of blows upon him, and battered him so stoutly, that in a few
seconds he was lying almost dead upon the place, and could not without difficulty crawl in to his companions.
These, indignant as they seemed to be at such an outrage, felt their secret joy in the adventure; they could hardly
keep from laughing, at seeing him so thoroughly curried, and his new brown coat bedusted through and through,
and bedaubed with white, as if he had had to do with millers.
The Count, who soon got notice of the business, broke into a boundless rage. He treated this act as the most
heinous crime; called it an infringement of the Burgfried, or Peace of the Castle, and caused his judge to make the
strictest inquisition touching it. The whited coat, it was imagined, would afford a leading proof. Every creature,
that possibly could have the smallest trade with flour or powder in the Castle, was submitted to investigation; but
in vain.
The Baron solemnly protested on his honour, that although this sort of jesting had considerably displeased him,
and the conduct of his Lordship the Count had not been the friendliest, yet he had got over the affair; and with
respect to the misfortune which had come upon the poet, or pasquinader, or whatsoever his title might be, he
knew absolutely nothing, and had not the most remote concern in it.
The operations of the strangers, and the general commotion of the house, soon effaced all recollection of the
matter; and so, without redress, the unlucky favourite had to pay dear for the satisfaction of pluming himself, a
short while, in feathers not his own.
Our troop, regularly acting every night, and on the whole very decently treated, now began to make more
clamorous demands, the better they were dealt with. Ere long their victuals, drink, attendance, lodging, grew
inadequate; and they called upon the Baron, their protector, to provide more liberally for them, and at last make
good those promises of comfortable entertainment, which he had been giving them so long. Their complaints
Chapter IX

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
grew louder; and the efforts of our friend to still them more and more abortive.
Meanwhile, excepting in rehearsals and hours of acting, Wilhelm scarcely ever came abroad. Shut up in one of the
remotest chambers, to which Mignon and the Harper alone had free access, he lived and moved in the
Shakspearean world, feeling or knowing nothing but the movements of his own mind.
We have heard of some Enchanter summoning, by magic formulas, a vast multitude of spiritual shapes into his
cell. The conjurations are so powerful that the whole space of the apartment is quickly full; and the spirits
crowding on to the verge of the little circle which they must not pass, around this, and above the master's head,
keep increasing in number, and ever whirling in perpetual transformation. Every corner is crammed, every crevice
is possessed. Embryos expand themselves, and giant forms contract into the size of nuts. Unhappily the
Black−artist has forgot the counter−word, with which he might command this flood of sprites again to ebb.
So sat Wilhelm in his privacy; with unknown movements, a thousand feelings and capacities awoke in him, of
which he formerly had neither notion nor anticipation. Nothing could allure him from this state; he was vexed and
restless if any one presumed to come to him, and talk of news or what was passing in the world.
Accordingly he scarce took notice of the circumstance, when told that a judicial sentence was about being
executed in the Castle−yard; the flogging of a boy, who had incurred suspicions of nocturnal housebreaking, and
who, as he wore a peruke−maker's coat, had most probably been one of the assaulters of the Pedant. The boy
indeed, it seemed, denied most obstinately; so that they could not inflict a formal punishment, but meant to give
him a slight memorial as a vagabond, and send him about his business; he having prowled about the
neighbourhood for several days, lain at night in the mills, and at last clapped a ladder to the gardenwall, and
mounted over by it.
Our friend saw nothing very strange in the transaction, and was dismissing it altogether, when Mignon came
running in, and assured him that the criminal was Friedrich, who, since the rencounter with the Stallmeister, had
vanished from the company, and not again been heard of.
Feeling an interest in the boy, Wilhelm hastily arose; he found, in the court−yard of the Castle, the preparations
almost finished. The Count loved solemnity on these occasions. The boy being now led out, our friend stept
forward, and entreated for delay, as he knew the boy, and had various things to say which might perhaps throw
light on the affair. He had difficulty in succeeding, notwithstanding all his statements; at length, however, he did
get permission to speak with the culprit in private. Friedrich averred, that concerning the assault in which the
Pedant had been used so harshly, he knew nothing whatever. He had merely been lurking about; and had come in
at night to see Philina, whose room he had discovered, and would certainly have reached, had he not been taken
by the way.
For the credit of the company, Wilhelm felt desirous not to have the truth of his adventure published. He hastened
to the Stallmeister; he begged him to show favour, and with his intimate knowledge of men and things about the
Castle, to find some means of quashing the affair, and dismissing the boy.
This whimsical gentleman, by Wilhelm's help, invented a little story; how the boy had belonged to the troop, had
run away from it, but soon wished to get back and be received again into his place; how he had accordingly been
trying in the night to come at certain of his well−wishers, and solicit their assistance. It was testified by others that
his former behaviour had been good; the ladies put their hands to the work; and Friedrich was let go.
Wilhelm took him in; a third person in that strange family, which for some time he had looked on as his own. The
old man and little Mignon received the returning wanderer kindly; and all the three combined to serve their friend
and guardian with attention, and procure him all the pleasure in their power.

Chapter X
PHILINA now succeeded in insinuating farther every day into the favour of the ladies. Whenever they were by
themselves, she was wont to lead the conversation on the men whom they saw about the Castle; and our friend
was not the last or least important that engaged them. The cunning girl was well aware that he had made a deep
impression on the Countess; she therefore talked about him often, telling much that she knew or did not know;
only taking care to speak of nothing that might be interpreted against him; eulogising, on the contrary, his
nobleness of mind, his generosity, and more than all, his modest and respectful conduct to the fair sex. To all
inquiries made about him she replied with equal prudence; and the Baroness, when she observed the growing
inclination of her amiable friend, was likewise very glad at the discovery. Her own intrigues with several men,
especially of late with Jarno, had not remained hidden from the Countess, whose pure soul could not look upon
such levities without disapprobation, and meek though earnest censures.
In this way, both Philina and the Baroness were personally interested in establishing a closer intercourse between
the Countess and our friend. Philina hoped, moreover, that there would occur some opportunity, when she might
once more labour for herself, and, if possible, get back the favour of the young man she had lost.
One day his Lordship with his guests had ridden out to hunt, and their return was not expected till the morrow. On
this, the Baroness devised a frolic, which was altogether in her way; for she loved disguises; and in order to
surprise her friends, would suddenly appear among them as a peasant girl at one time, at another as a page, at
another as a hunter's boy. By which means she almost gave herself the air of a little fairy, that is present
everywhere, and exactly in the place where it is least expected. Nothing could exceed this lady's joy, if, without
being recognised, she could contrive to wait upon the company for some time as a servant, or mix among them
anyhow, and then at last in some sportful way disclose herself.
Towards night, she sent for Wilhelm to her chamber; and, happening to have something else to do just then, she
left Philina to receive him and prepare him.
He arrived, and found to his surprise, not the honourable lady, but the giddy actress in the room. She received him
with a certain dignified openness of manner, which she had of late been practising, and so constrained him
likewise to be courteous.
At first she rallied him in general on the good fortune which pursued him everywhere, and which, as she could not
but see, had led him hither, in the present case. Then she delicately set before him the treatment with which of late
he had afflicted her; she blamed and upbraided herself; confessed that she had but too well deserved such
punishment; described with the greatest candour what she called her former situation; adding, that she would
despise herself, if she were not capable of altering, and making herself worthy of his friendship.
Wilhelm was struck with this oration. He had too little knowledge of the world to understand that persons, quite
unstable and incapable of all improvement, frequently accuse themselves in the bitterest manner, confessing and
deploring their faults with extreme ingenuousness, though they possess not the smallest power within them to
retire from that course, along which the irresistible tendency of their nature is dragging them forward.
Accordingly, he could not find in his heart to behave inexorably to the graceful sinner; he entered into
conversation, and learned from her the project of a singular disguisement, wherewith it was intended to surprise
the Countess.
He found some room for hesitation here; nor did he hide his scruples from Philina; but the Baroness, entering at
this moment, left him not an instant for reflection; she hurried him away with her, declaring it was just the proper
hour.

Chapter X

93

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
It was now grown dark. She took him to the Count's wardrobe; made him change his own coat with his Lordship's
silk night−gown; and put the cap with red trimmings on his head. She then led him forward to the cabinet; and
bidding him sit down upon the large chair, and take a book, she lit the Argand's lamp, which stood before him,
and showed him what he was to do, and what kind of part he had to play.
They would inform the Countess, she said, of her husband's unexpected arrival, and that he was in very bad
humour. The Countess would come in, walk up and down the room once or twice, then place herself beside the
back of his chair, lay her arm upon his shoulder, and speak a few words. He was to play the cross husband as long
and as well as possible; and when obliged to disclose himself, he must behave politely, handsomely and gallantly.
Wilhelm was left sitting, restlessly enough, in this singular mask. The proposal had come upon him by surprise;
the execution of it got the start of the deliberation. The Baroness had vanished from the room, before he saw how
dangerous the post was which he had engaged to fill. He could not deny that the beauty, the youth, the
gracefulness of the Countess had made some impression on him; but his nature was entirely averse to all empty
gallantry, and his principles forbade any thought of more serious enterprises; so that his perplexity at this moment
was in truth extreme. The fear of displeasing the Countess, and that of pleasing her too well, were equally busy in
his mind.
Every female charm, that had ever acted on him, now showed itself again to his imagination. Mariana rose before
him in her white morning−gown, and entreated his remembrance. Philina's loveliness, her beautiful hair, her
insinuating blandishments, had again become attractive by her late presence. Yet all this retired as if behind the
veil of distance, when he figured to himself the noble blooming Countess, whose arm in a few minutes he would
feel upon his neck, whose innocent caresses he was there to answer.
The strange mode, in which he was to be delivered out of this perplexity, he certainly did not anticipate. We may
judge of his astonishment, nay his terror, when the door opened behind him; and at the first stolen look in the
mirror, he quite clearly discerned the Count coming in with a light in his hand. His doubt what he should do,
whether he should sit still or rise, should fly, confess, deny, or beg forgiveness, lasted but a few instants. The
Count, who had remained motionless standing in the door, retired and shut it softly. At the same moment, the
Baroness sprang forward by the side−door, extinguished the lamp, tore Wilhelm from his chair, and hurried him
with her into the closet. Instantly, he threw off the night−gown, and put it in its former place. The Baroness took
his coat under her arm, and hastened with him through several rooms, passages and partitions, into her chamber;
where Wilhelm, so soon as she recovered breath, was informed that on her going to the Countess, and delivering
the fictitious intelligence about her husband's arrival, the Countess had answered: "I know it already: what can
have happened? I saw him riding in, at the postern, even now." On which the Baroness, in an excessive panic, had
run to the Count's chamber to give warning.
"Unhappily you came too late!" said Wilhelm. "The Count was in the room before you, and saw me sitting."
"And recognised you?"
"That I know not. He was looking at me in the glass, as I at him; and before I could well determine whether it was
he or a spirit, he drew back, and closed the door behind him."
The anxiety of the Baroness increased, when a servant came to call her, signifying that the Count was with his
lady. She went with no light heart; and found the Count silent and thoughtful indeed, but milder and kinder in his
words than usual. She knew not what to think of it. They spoke about the incidents of the chase, and the causes of
his quick return. The conversation soon ran out. The Count became taciturn; and it struck the Baroness
particularly, when he asked for Wilhelm, and expressed a wish that he were sent for, to come and read something.

Chapter X

94

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Wilhelm, who had now dressed himself in the Baroness's chamber, and in some degree recovered his composure,
obeyed the order, not without anxiety. The Count gave him a book; out of which he read an adventurous tale, very
little at his ease. His voice had a certain inconstancy and quivering in it, which fortunately corresponded with the
import of the story. The Count more than once gave kindly tokens of approval; and at last dismissed our friend,
with praises of his exquisite manner of reading.

Chapter XI
WILHELM had scarcely read one or two of Shakspeare's plays, till their effect on him became so strong that he
could go no farther. His whole soul was in commotion. He sought an opportunity to speak with Jarno; to whom,
on meeting with him, he expressed his boundless gratitude for such delicious entertainment.
"I clearly enough foresaw," said Jarno, "that you would not remain insensible to the charms of the most
extraordinary and most admirable of all writers."
"Yes!" exclaimed our friend; "I cannot recollect that any book, any man, any incident of my life, has produced
such important effects on me, as the precious works, to which by your kindness I have been directed. They seem
as if they were performances of some celestial genius, descending among men, to make them, by the mildest
instructions, acquainted with themselves. They are no fictions! You would think, while reading them, you stood
before the unclosed awful Books of Fate, while the whirlwind of most impassioned life was howling through the
leaves, and tossing them fiercely to and fro. The strength and tenderness, the power and peacefulness of this man
have so astonished and transported me, that I long vehemently for the time when I shall have it in my power to
read farther."
"Bravo!" said Jarno, holding out his hand, and squeezing our friend's: "this is as it should be! And the
consequences, which I hope for, will likewise surely follow."
"I wish," said Wilhelm, "I could but disclose to you all that is going on within me even now. All the anticipations
I have ever had regarding man and his destiny, which have accompanied me from youth upwards, often
unobserved by myself, I find developed and fulfilled in Shakspeare's writings. It seems as if he cleared up every
one of our enigmas to us, though we cannot say: Here or there is the word of solution. His men appear like natural
men, and yet they are not. These, the most mysterious and complex productions of creation, here act before us as
if they were watches, whose dial−plates and cases were of crystal; which pointed out, according to their use, the
course of the hours and minutes; while, at the same time, you could discern the combination of wheels and springs
that turned them. The few glances I have cast over Shakspeare's world incite me, more than anything beside, to
quicken my footsteps forward into the actual world, to mingle in the flood of destinies that is suspended over it;
and at length if I shall prosper, to draw a few cups from the great ocean of true nature, and to distribute them from
off the stage among the thirsting people of my native land."
"I feel delighted with the temper of mind in which I now behold you," answered Jarno, laying his hand upon the
shoulder of the excited youth; "renounce not the purpose of embarking in active life. Make haste to employ with
alacrity the years that are granted you. If I can serve you, I will with all my heart. As yet, I have not asked you
how you came into this troop, for which you certainly were neither born nor bred. So much I hope and see: you
long to be out of it. I know nothing of your parentage, of your domestic circumstances; consider what you shall
confide to me. Thus much only I can say: the times of war we live in may produce quick turns of fortune; did you
incline devoting your strength and talents to our service, not fearing labour, and if need were, danger, I might
even now have an opportunity to put you in a situation, which you would not afterwards be sorry to have filled for
a time." Wilhelm could not sufficiently express his gratitude; he was ready to impart to his friend and patron the
whole history of his life.

Chapter XI

95

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
In the course of this conversation, they had wandered far into the park, and at last come upon the highway that
crossed it. Jarno stood silent for a moment, and then said: "Deliberate on my proposal, determine, give me your
answer in a few days, and then let me have the narrative you mean to trust me with. I assure you, it has all along
to me seemed quite incomprehensible, how you ever could have anything to do with such a class of people. I have
often thought with vexation and spleen, how, in order to gain a paltry living, you must fix your heart on a
wandering ballad−monger, and a silly mongrel, neither male nor female."
He had not yet concluded, when an officer on horseback came hastily along; a groom following him with a led
horse. Jarno shouted a warm salutation to him. The officer sprang from his horse; Jarno and he embraced, and
talked together; while Wilhelm, confounded at the last expressions of his warlike friend, stood thoughtfully at a
side. Jarno turned over some papers which the stranger had delivered to him; while the latter came to Wilhelm;
held out his hand, and said with emphasis: "I find you in worthy company; follow the counsel of your friend; and
by doing so, accomplish likewise the desire of an unknown man, who takes a genuine interest in you." So saying,
he embraced Wilhelm and pressed him cordially to his breast. At the same instant, Jarno advanced, and said to the
stranger: "It is best that I ride on with you: by this means you may get the necessary orders, and set out again
before night." Both then leaped into their saddles, and left our astonished friend to his own reflections.
Jarno's last words were still ringing in his ears. It galled him to see the two human beings, that had most
innocently won his affections, so grievously disparaged by a man whom he honoured so much. The strange
embracing of the officer, whom he knew not, made but a slight impression on him; it occupied his curiosity and
his imagination for a moment: but Jarno's speech had cut him to the heart; he was deeply hurt by it; and now, in
his way homewards, he broke out into reproaches against himself, that he should for a single instant have
mistaken or forgotten the unfeeling coldness of Jarno, which looked out from his very eyes, and spoke in all his
gestures.
"No!" exclaimed he, "thou conceivest, dead−hearted worldling, that thou canst be a friend? All that thou hast
power to offer me is not worth the sentiment which binds me to these forlorn beings. How fortunate, that I have
discovered in time what I had to expect from thee!"
Mignon came to meet him as he entered; he clasped her in his arms, exclaiming: "Nothing, nothing shall part us,
thou good little creature! The seeming prudence of the world shall never cause me to forsake thee, or forget what I
owe thee."
The child, whose warm caresses he had been accustomed to avoid, rejoiced with all her heart at this unlooked−for
show of tenderness, and clung so fast to him, that he had some difficulty to get loose from her.
From this period, he kept a stricter eye on Jarno's conduct: many parts of it he did not think quite praiseworthy;
nay several things came out, which totally displeased him. He had strong suspicions, for example, that the verses
on the Baron, which the poor Pedant had so dearly paid for, were composed by Jarno. And as the latter, in
Wilhelm's presence, had made sport of the adventure, our friend thought here was certainly a symptom of a most
corrupted heart; for what could be more depraved than to treat a guiltless person, whose griefs oneself had
occasioned, with jeering and mockery, instead of trying to satisfy or to idemnify him? In this matter, Wilhelm
would himself willingly have brought about reparation; and ere long a very curious accident led him to obtain
some traces of the persons concerned in that nocturnal outrage.
Hitherto his friends had contrived to keep him unacquainted with the fact, that some of the young officers were in
the habit of passing whole nights, in merriment and jollity, with certain actors and actresses, in the lower hall of
the old Castle. One morning, having risen early according to his custom, he happened to visit this chamber, and
found the gallant gentlemen just in the act of performing rather a singular operation. They had mixed a bowl of
water with a quantity of chalk, and were plastering this gruel with a brush upon their waistcoats and pantaloons,
without stripping; thus very expeditiously restoring the spotlessness of their apparel. On witnessing this piece of
Chapter XI

96

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
ingenuity, our friend was at once struck with the recollection of the poor Pedant's whited and bedusted coat: his
suspicions gathered strength, when he learned that some relations of the Baron's were among the party.
To throw some light on his doubts, he engaged the youths to breakfast with him. They were very lively, and told a
multitude of pleasant stories. One of them especially, who for a time had been on the recruiting service, was loud
in praising the craft and activity of his captain; who, it appeared, understood the art of alluring men of all kinds
towards him, and overreaching every one by the deception proper for him. He circumstantially described, how
several young people of good families and careful education had been cozened, by playing off to them a thousand
promises of honour and preferment; and he heartily laughed at the simpletons, who felt so gratified, when first
enlisted, at the thought of being esteemed and introduced to notice by so reputable, prudent, bold and munificent
an officer.
Wilhelm blessed his better genius for having drawn him back in time from the abyss, to whose brink he had
approached so near. Jarno he now looked upon as nothing better than a crimp; the embrace of the stranger officer
was easily explained. He viewed the feelings and opinions of these men with contempt and disgust; from that
moment he carefully avoided coming into contact with any one that wore a uniform; and when he heard that the
army was about to move its quarters, the news would have been extremely welcome to him, if he had not feared
that immediately on its departure, he himself must be banished from the neighbourhood of his lovely friend,
perhaps forever.

Chapter XII
MEANWHILE the Baroness had spent several days disquieted by anxious fears and unsatisfied curiosity. Since
the late adventure, the Count's demeanor had been altogether an enigma to her. His manner was changed; none of
his customary jokes were to be heard. His demands on the company and the servants had very much abated. Little
pedantry or imperiousness was now to be discerned in him; he was silent and thoughtful; yet withal he seemed
composed and placid; in short, he was quite another man.
In choosing the books which now and then he caused to be read to him, those of a serious, often a religious cast
were pitched upon; and the Baroness lived in perpetual fright lest, beneath this apparent serenity, a secret rancour
might be lurking; a silent purpose to revenge the offence he had so accidentally discovered. She determined,
therefore, to make Jarno her confidant; and this the more freely, as that gentleman and she already stood in a
relation to each other, where it is not usual to be very cautious in keeping secrets. For some time Jarno had been
her dearest friend; yet they had been dextrous enough to conceal their attachment and joys from the noisy world in
which they moved. To the Countess alone this new romance had not remained unknown; and very possibly the
Baroness might wish to get her fair friend occupied with some similar engagement, and thus to escape the silent
reproaches she had often to endure from that noble−minded woman.
Scarcely had the Baroness related the occurrence to her lover, when he cried out, laughing: "To a certainty the old
fool believes that he has seen his ghost! He dreads that the vision may betoken some misfortune, perhaps death to
him, and so he is become quite tame, as all half−men do, in thinking of that consummation which no one has
escaped, or will escape. Softly a little! As I hope he will live long enough, we may now train him at least, so that
he shall not again give disturbance to his wife and household."
They accordingly, as soon as any opportunity occurred, began talking, in the presence of the Count, about
warnings, visions, apparitions, and the like. Jarno played the sceptic, the Baroness likewise; and they carried it so
far, that his Lordship at last took Jarno aside, reproved him for his freethinking, and produced his own experience
to prove the possibility, nay actual occurrence, of such preternatural events. Jarno affected to be struck; to be in
doubt; and finally to be convinced: but in private with his friend, he made himself so much the merrier at the
credulous weakling, who had thus been cured of his evil habits by a bugbear, but who, they admitted, still
Chapter XII

97

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
deserved some praise for expecting dire calamity, or death itself, with such composure.
"The natural result, which the present apparition might have had, would possibly have ruffled him!" exclaimed the
Baroness, with her wonted vivacity; to which, when anxiety was taken from her heart, she had instantly returned.
Jarno was richly rewarded; and the two contrived fresh projects for frightening the Count still farther; and still
farther exciting and confirming the affection of the Countess for Wilhelm.
With this intention, the whole story was related to the Countess. She, indeed, expressed her displeasure at such
conduct; but from that time she became more thoughtful, and in peaceful moments seemed to be considering,
pursuing and painting out that scene which had been prepared for her.
The preparations, now going forward on every side, left no room for doubt that the armies were soon to move in
advance, and the Prince at the same time to change his headquarters. It was even said that the Count intended
leaving his Castle, and returning to the city. Our players could therefore, without difficulty, calculate the aspect of
their stars; yet none of them, except Melina, took any measures in consequence: the rest strove only to catch as
much enjoyment as they could from the moment that was passing over them.
Wilhelm, in the mean time, was engaged with a peculiar task. The Countess had required from him a copy of his
writings; and he looked on this request as the noblest recompense for his labours.
A young author, who has not yet seen himself in print, will, in such a case, apply no ordinary care to provide a
clear and beautiful transcript of his works. It is like the golden age of authorship: he feels transported into those
centuries when the press had not inundated the world with so many useless writings, when none but excellent
performances were copied, and kept by the noblest men; and he easily admits the illusion, that his own accurately
ruled and measured manuscript may itself prove an excellent performance, worthy to be kept and valued by some
future critic.
The Prince being shortly to depart, a great entertainment had been appointed in honour of him. Many ladies of the
neighbourhood were invited; and the Countess had dressed herself betimes. On this occasion, she had taken a
costlier suit than usual. Her head−dress, and the decorations of her hair, were more exquisite and studied: she
wore all her jewels. The Baroness, too, had done her utmost to appear with becoming taste and splendour.
Philina, observing that both ladies, in expectation of their guests, felt the time rather tedious, proposed to send for
Wilhelm, who was wishing to present his manuscript, now completed, and to read them some other little pieces.
He came; and on his entrance was astonished at the form and the graces of the Countess, which her decorations
had but made more visible and striking. Being ordered by the ladies, he began to read; but with so much absence
of mind, and so badly, that had not his audience been excessively indulgent, they would very soon have dismissed
him.
Every time he looked at the Countess, it seemed to him as if a spark of electric fire were glancing before his eyes.
In the end, he knew not where to find the breath he wanted for his reading. The Countess had always pleased him;
but now it appeared as if he never had beheld a being so perfect and so lovely. A thousand thoughts flitted up and
down his soul; what follows might be nearly their substance.
"How foolish is it in so many poets, and men of sentiment as they are called, to make war on pomp and
decoration; requiring that women of all ranks should wear no dress but what is simple and conformable to nature!
They rail at decoration, without once considering, that when we see a plain or positively ugly person clothed in a
costly and gorgeous fashion, it is not the poor decoration that displeases us. I would assemble all the judges in the
world, and ask them here if they wished to see one of these folds, of these ribbons and laces, these braids, ringlets
and glancing stones removed? Would they not dread disturbing the delightful impression that so naturally and
spontaneously meets us here? Yes, naturally I will say! As Minerva sprang in complete armour from the head of
Chapter XII

Jove, so does this goddess seem to have stept forth with a light foot, in all her ornaments, from t he bosom of
some flower."
While reading, he turned his eyes upon her frequently, as if he wished to stamp this image on his soul forever; he
more than once read wrong, yet without falling into confusion of mind; though, at other times, he used to feel the
mistaking of a word or a letter as a painful deformity, which spoiled a whole recitation.
A false alarm of the arrival of the guests put an end to the reading; the Baroness went out; and the Countess, while
about to shut her writing−desk, which was standing open, took up her casket, and put some other rings upon her
finger. "We are soon to part," said she, keeping her eyes upon the casket: "accept a memorial of a true friend, who
wishes nothing more earnestly than that you may always prosper." She then took out a ring, which, underneath a
crystal, bore a little plait of woven hair beautifully set with diamonds. She held it out to Wilhelm, who, on taking
it, knew neither what to say nor do, but stood as if rooted to the ground. The Countess shut her desk, and sat down
upon the sofa.
"And I must go empty?" said Philina, kneeling down at the Countess's right hand. "Do but look at the man; he
carries such a store of words in his mouth, when no one wants to hear them; and now he cannot stammer out the
poorest syllable of thanks. Quick, sir! Express your services by way of pantomime at least; and if today you can
invent nothing, then, for Heaven's sake, be my imitator."
Philina seized the right hand of the Countess, and kissed it warmly. Wilhelm sank upon his knee, laid hold of the
left and pressed it to his lips. The Countess seemed embarrassed, yet without displeasure.
"Ah!" cried Philina, "so much splendour of attire I may have seen before; but never one so fit to wear it. What
bracelets, but also what a hand! What a necklace, but also what a bosom!"
"Peace, little cozener!" said the Countess.
"Is this his Lordship then?" said Philina, pointing to a rich medallion, which the Countess wore on her left side, by
a particular chain.
"He is painted in his bridegroom dress," replied the Countess.
"Was he then so young?" inquired Philina; "I know it is but a year or two since you were married."
"His youth must be placed to the artist's account," replied the lady.
"He is a handsome man," observed Philina. "But was there never," she continued, placing her hand on the
Countess's heart, "never any other image that found its way in secret hither?"
"Thou art very bold, Philina!" cried she; "I have spoiled thee. Let me never hear the like again."
"If you are angry, then am I unhappy," said Philina, springing up, and hastening from the room.
Wilhelm still held that lovely hand in both of his. His eyes were fixed on the bracelet−clasp; he noticed, with
extreme surprise, that his initials were traced on it, in lines of brilliants.
"Have I then," he modestly inquired, "your own hair in this precious ring?"
"Yes," replied she, in a faint voice; then suddenly collecting herself, she said, and pressed his hand: "Arise, and
fare you well!"
Chapter XII

"Here is my name," cried he, "by the most curious chance!" He pointed to the bracelet−clasp.
"How?" cried the Countess: "it is the cipher of a female friend!"
"They are the initials of my name. Forget me not. Your image is engraven on my heart, and will never be effaced
Farewell! I must be gone."
He kissed her hand, and meant to rise; but, as in dreams, some strange thing fades and changes into something
stranger, and the succeeding wonder takes us by surprise; so, without knowing how it happened, he found the
Countess in his arms; her lips were resting upon his, and their warm mutual kisses were yielding them that
blessedness, which mortals sip from the topmost sparkling foam on the freshly−poured cup of love.
Her head lay on his shoulder; the disordered ringlets and ruffles were forgotten. She had thrown her arm round
him; he clasped her with vivacity; and pressed her again and again to his breast. O that such a moment could but
last forever! And woe to envious fate that shortened even this brief moment to our friends!
How terrified was Wilhelm, how astounded did he start from his happy dream, when the Countess, with a shriek,
on a sudden tore herself away, and hastily pressed her hand against her heart.
He stood confounded before her; she held the other hand upon her eyes, and, after a moment's pause, exclaimed:
"Away! leave me! delay not!"
He continued standing.
"Leave me!" she cried; and taking off her hand from her eyes, she looked at him with an indescribable expression
of countenance; and added, in the most tender and affecting voice: "Fly, if you love me."
Wilhelm was out of the chamber, and again in his room, before he knew what he was doing.
Unhappy creatures! What singular warning of chance or of destiny tore them asunder?

Chapter I
LAERTES was standing at the window in a thoughtful mood resting on his arm, and looking out into the fields.
Philina came gliding towards him, across the large hall; she leant upon him, and began to mock him for his
serious looks.
"Do not laugh," replied he; "it is frightful to think how Time goes on, how all things change and have an end. See
here! A little while ago there was a stately camp: how pleasantly the tents looked; what restless life and motion
was within them; how carefully they watched the whole enclosure! And behold, it is all vanished in a day! For a
short while, that trampled straw, those holes which the cooks have dug, will show a trace of what was here; and
soon the whole will be ploughed and reaped as formerly, and the presence of so many thousand gallant fellows in
this quarter will but glimmer in the memories of one or two old men."
Philina began to sing, and dragged forth her friend to dance with her in the hall. "Since Time is not a person we
can overtake when he is past," cried she, "let us honour him with mirth and cheerfulness of heart while he is
passing."

Book IV

They had scarcely made a step or two, when Frau Melina came walking through the hall. Philina was wicked
enough to invite her to join them in the dance, and thus to bring her in mind of the shape to which her pregnancy
had reduced her.
"That I might never more see a woman in an interesting situation!" said Philina, when her back was turned.
"Yet she feels an interest in it," said Laertes.
"But she manages so shockingly. Didst thou notice that wabbling fold of her shortened petticoat, which always
travels out before her when she moves? She has not the smallest knack or skill to trim herself a little, and conceal
her state."
"Let her be," said Laertes; "time will soon come to her aid."
"It were prettier, however," cried Philina, "if we could shake children from the trees."
The Baron entered, and spoke some kind words to them, adding a few presents, in the name of the Count and the
Countess, who had left the place very early in the morning. He then went to Wilhelm, who was busy in the side
chamber with Mignon. She had been extremely affectionate and taking; had asked minutely about Wilhelm's
parents, brothers, sisters and relations; and so brought to his mind the duty which he owed his people, to send
them some tidings of himself.
With the farewell compliments of the family, the Baron delivered him an assurance from the Count, that his
Lordship had been exceedingly obliged by his acting, his poetical labours and his theatrical exertions. For proof of
this statement, the Baron then drew forth a purse, through whose beautiful texture the bright glance of new gold
coin was sparkling out. Wilhelm drew back, refusing to accept of it.
"Look upon this gift," said the Baron, "as a compensation for your time, as an acknowledgment of your trouble,
not as the reward of your talents. If genius procures us a good name and good−will from men, it is fair likewise
that, by our diligence and efforts, we should earn the means to satisfy our wants; since, after all, we are not wholly
spirit. Had we been in town, where everything is to be got, we should have changed this little sum into a watch, a
ring, or something of that sort; but as it is, I must place the magic rod in your own hands; procure a trinket with it,
such as may please you best and be of greatest use, and keep it for our sakes. At the same time, you must not
forget to hold the purse in honour. It was knit by the fingers of our ladies; they meant that the cover should give to
its contents the most pleasing form."
"Forgive my embarrassment," said Wilhelm, "and my doubts about accepting this present. It as it were annihilates
the little I have done, and hinders the free play of happy recollection. Money is a fine thing, when any matter is to
be completely settled and abolished; I feel unwilling to be so entirely abolished from the recollection of your
house."
"That is not the case," replied the Baron; "but feeling so tenderly yourself, you could not wish that the Count
should be obliged to consider himself wholly your debtor; especially when I assure you, that his Lordship's
highest ambition has always consisted in being punctual and just. He is not uninformed of the labour you have
undergone, or of the zeal with which you have devoted all your time to execute his views; nay he is aware that, to
quicken certain operations, you have even expended money of your own. With what face shall I appear before
him, then, if I cannot say that his acknowledgment has given you satisfaction?"
"If I thought only of myself," said Wilhelm; "if I might follow merely the dictates of my own feelings, I should
certainly, in spite of all these reasons, steadfastly refuse this gift, generous and honourable as it is: but I will not
deny, that at the very moment when it brings me into one perplexity, it frees me from another, into which I have
Book IV

101

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
lately fallen with regard to my relations, and which has in secret caused me much uneasiness. My management,
not only of the time, but also of the money, for which I have to give account, has not been the best; and now, by
the kindness of his Lordship, I shall be enabled, with confidence, to give my people news of the good fortune to
which this curious bypath has led me. I therefore sacrifice those feelings of delicacy, which like a tender
conscience admonish us on such occasions, to a higher duty; and, that I may appear courageously before my
father, I must consent to stand ashamed before you."
"It is singular," replied the Baron, "to see what a world of hesitation people feel about accepting money from their
friends and patrons, though ready to receive any other gift with joy and thankfulness. Human nature manifests
some other such peculiarities, by which many scruples of a similar kind are produced and carefully cherished."
"Is it not the same with all points of honour?" said our friend.
"It is so," replied the Baron; "and with several other prejudices. We must not root them out, lest, in doing so, we
tear up noble plants along with them. Yet I am always glad when I meet with men, that feel superior to such
objections, when the case requires it; and I think with pleasure on the story of that ingenious poet, which I dare
say you have heard of. He had written several plays for the court−theatre, which were honoured by the warmest
approbation of the monarch. 'I must give him a distinguished recompense, said the generous prince: 'ask him
whether he would choose to have some jewel given him; or if he would disdain to accept a sum of money.' In his
humorous way the poet answered the inquiring courtier: 'I am thankful, with all my heart, for these gracious
purposes; and as the Emperor is daily taking money from us, I see not wherefore I should feel ashamed of taking
some from him."'
Scarcely had the Baron left the room, when Wilhelm eagerly began to count the cash, which had come to him so
unexpectedly, and, as he thought, so undeservedly. It seemed as if the worth and dignity of gold, not usually felt
till later years, had now, by anticipation, twinkled in his eyes for the first time, as the fine glancing coins rolled
out from the beautiful purse. He reckoned up, and found that, particularly as Melina had engaged immediately to
pay the loan, he had now as much or more on the right−side of his account, as on that day when Philina first asked
him for the nosegay. With a little secret satisfaction, he looked upon his talents; with a little pride, upon the
fortune which had led him and attended him. He now seized the pen, with an assured mind, to write a letter, which
might free his family from their anxieties, and set his late proceedings in the most favourable light. He abstained
from any special narrative; and only by significant and mysterious hints, left them room for guessing at what had
befallen him. The good condition of his cash−book, the advantage he had earned by his talents, the favour of the
great and of the fair, acquaintance with a wider circle, the improvement of his bodily and mental gifts, his hopes
from the future, altogether formed such a fair cloudpicture, that Fata Morgana itself could scarcely have thrown
together a stranger or a better.
In this happy exaltation, the letter being folded up, he went on to maintain a conversation with himself,
recapitulating what he had been writing, and pointing out for himself an active and glorious future. The example
of so many gallant warriors had fired him; the poetry of Shakespeare had opened a new world to him; from the
lips of the beautiful Countess he had inhaled an inexpressible inspiration. All this could not and would not be
without effect.
The Stallmeister came to inquire whether they were ready with their packing. Alas! with a single exception of
Melinda, no one of them had thought of it. Now, however, they were speedily to be in motion. The Count had
engaged to have the whole party conveyed forward a few days' journey on their way: the horses were now in
readiness, and could not long be wanted. Wilhelm asked for his trunk: Frau Melina had taken it to put her own
things in. He asked for money; Herr Melina had stowed it all far down at the bottom of his box. Philina said she
had still some room in hers; she took Wilhelm's clothes, and bade Mignon bring the rest. Wilhelm, not without
reluctance, was obliged to let it be so.

Book IV

102

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
While they were loading, and getting all things ready, Melina said: "I am sorry we should travel like mountebanks
and rope−dancers; I could wish that Mignon would put on girl's clothes, and that the Harper would let his beard
be shorn." Mignon clung firmly to Wilhelm and cried, with great vivacity: "I am a boy; I will be no girl!" The old
man held his peace; and Philina, on this suggestion, made some merry observations on the singularity of their
protector the Count. "If the Harper should cut off his beard," said she, "let him sew it carefully upon a ribbon, and
keep it by him, that he may put it on again whenever his Lordship the Count falls in with him in any quarter of the
world. It was this beard alone that procured him the favour of his Lordship."
On being pressed to give an explanation of this singular speech, Philina said to them: "The Count thinks it
contributes very much to the completeness of theatrical illusion if the actor continues to play his part, and to
sustain his character, even in common life. It was for this reason that he showed such favour to the Pedant; and he
judged it, in like manner, very fitting that the Harper not only wore his false beard at nights on the stage, but also
constantly by day; and he used to be delighted at the natural appearance of the mask."
While the rest were laughing at this error, and the other strange opinions of the Count, the Harper led our friend
aside, took leave of him, and begged with tears that he would even now let him go. Wilhelm spoke to him,
declaring that he would protect him against all the world, that no one should touch a hair of his head, much less
send him off against his will.
The old man seemed affected deeply; an unwonted fire was glowing in his eyes. "It is not that," cried he, "which
drives me away. I have long been reproaching myself in secret for staying with you. I ought to linger nowhere; for
misfortune flies to overtake me, and injures all that are connected with me. Dread everything, unless you dismiss
me; but ask me no questions; I belong not to myself; I cannot stay."
"To whom dost thou belong? Who can exert such a power on thee?"
"Leave me my horrid secret, and let me go! The vengeance which pursues me is not of the earthly judge. I belong
to an inexorable Destiny; I cannot stay, and I dare not."
"In the situation thou art now in, I certainly will not let thee go."
"It were high treason against you, my benefactor, if I should delay. I am secure while with you, but you are in
peril. You know not whom you keep beside you. I am guilty, but more wretched than guilty. My presence scares
happiness away; and good deeds grow powerless, when I become concerned in them. Fugitive, unresting I should
be, that my evil genius might not seize me, which pursues but at a distance, and only appears when I have found a
place, and am laying down my head to seek repose. More grateful I cannot show myself, than by forsaking you."
"Strange man! Thou canst neither take away the confidence I place in thee, nor the hope I feel to see thee happy. I
wish not to penetrate the secrets of thy superstition; but if thou livest in belief of wonderful forebodings and
entanglements of Fate, then, to cheer and hearten thee, I say, unite thyself to my good fortune, and let us see
which genius is the stronger, thy dark or my bright one."
Wilhelm seized this opportunity of suggesting to him many other comfortable things; for of late our friend had
begun to imagine that this singular attendant of his must be a man who, by chance or destiny, had been led into
some weighty crime, the remembrance of which he was ever bearing on his conscience. A few days ago,
Wilhelm, listening to his singing, had observed attentively the following lines:For him the light of ruddy morn
But paints the horizon red with flame;And voices, from the depths of nature borne, Woe! woe! upon his guilty
head proclaim.
But, let the old man urge what arguments he pleased, our friend had constantly a stronger argument at hand. He
turned everything on its fairest side; spoke so bravely, heartily and cheerily, that even the old man seemed again

to gather spirits, and to throw aside his whims.

Chapter II
MELINA was in hopes to get established with his company, in a small but thriving town at some distance. They
had already reached the place where the Count's horses were to turn; and now they looked about for other
carriages and cattle to transport them onward. Melina had engaged to provide them a conveyance; he showed
himself but niggardly, according to his custom. Wilhelm, on the contrary, had the shining ducats of the Countess
in his pocket, and thought he had the fullest right to spend them merrily; forgetting very soon how ostentatiously
he had produced them in the stately balance transmitted to his father.
His friend Shakspeare, whom with the greatest joy he acknowledged as his godfather, and rejoiced the more that
his name was Wilhelm, had introduced him to a prince, who frolicked for a time among mean, nay vicious
companions, and who, notwithstanding his nobleness of nature, found pleasure in the rudeness, indecency and
coarse intemperance of these altogether sensual knaves. This ideal likeness, which he figured as the type and the
excuse of his own actual condition, was most welcome to our friend; and the process of self−deception, to which
already he displayed an almost invincible tendency, was thereby very much facilitated.
He now began to think about his dress. It struck him that a waistcoat, over which, in case of need, one could
throw a little short mantle, was a very fit thing for a traveller. Long knit pantaloons, and a pair of lacing−boots,
seemed the true garb of a pedestrian. He next procured a fine silk sash, which he tied about him, under the
pretence at first of securing warmth for his person. On the other hand, he freed his neck from the tyranny of
stocks; and got a few stripes of muslin sewed upon his shirt; making the pieces of considerable breadth, so that
they presented the complete appearance of an ancient ruff. The beautiful silk neckerchief; the memorial of
Mariana, which had once been saved from burning, now lay slackly tied beneath this muslin collar. A round hat,
with a parti−coloured band, and a large feather, perfected the mask.
The women all asserted that this garb became him very well. Philina in particular appeared enchanted with it. She
solicited his hair for herself; beautiful locks, which, the closer to approach the natural ideal, he had unmercifully
clipped. By so doing, she recommended herself not amiss to his favour; and our friend, who, by his
openhandedness, had acquired the right of treating his companions somewhat in Prince Harry's manner, ere long
fell into the humour of himself contriving a few wild tricks, and presiding in the execution of them. The people
fenced, they danced, they devised all kinds of sports; and in their gaiety of heart partook of what tolerable wine
they could fall in with, in copious proportions; while, amid the disorder of this tumultuous life, Philina lay in wait
for the coy hero; over whom let his better Genius keep watch!
One chief diversion, which yielded the company a frequent and very pleasing entertainment, consisted in
producing an extempore play, in which their late benefactors and patrons were mimicked and turned into ridicule.
Some of our actors had seized very neatly whatever was peculiar in the outward manner of several distinguished
people in the Count's establishment; their imitation of these was received by the rest of the party with the greatest
approbation; and when Philina produced, from the secret archives of her experience, certain peculiar declarations
of love that had been made to her, the audience were like to die with laughing and malicious joy.
Wilhelm censured their ingratitude; but they told him in reply, that these gentry well deserved what they were
getting, their general conduct towards such deserving people as our friends believed themselves, not having been
by any means the best imaginable. The little consideration, the neglect they had experienced, were now described
with many aggravations. The jesting, bantering and mimicry proceeded as before; our party were growing bitterer
and more unjust every minute.
"I wish," observed Wilhelm, "there were no envy or selfishness lurking under what you say, but that you would
Chapter II

104

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
regard those persons and their station in the proper point of view. It is a peculiar thing to be placed, by one's very
birth, in an elevated situation in society. The man for whom inherited wealth has secured a perfect freedom of
existence; who finds himself from his youth upwards abundantly encompassed with all the secondary essentials,
so to speak, of human life,−will generally become accustomed to consider these qualifications as the first and
greatest of all; while the worth of that mode of human life, which nature from her own stores equips and
furnishes, will strike him much more faintly. The behaviour of noblemen to their inferiors, and likewise to each
other, is regulated by external preferences: they give each credit for his title, his rank, his clothes and equipage,
but his individual merits come not into play."
This speech was honoured with the company's unbounded applause. They declared it to be shameful, that men of
merit should constantly be pushed into the background; and that in the great world, there should not be a trace of
natural and hearty intercourse. On this latter point particularly they overshot all bounds.
"Blame them not for it," said Wilhelm, "rather pity them! They have seldom an exalted feeling of that happiness
which we admit to be the highest that can flow from the inward abundance of nature. Only to us poor creatures is
it granted to enjoy the happiness of friendship, in its richest fulness. Those dear to us we cannot elevate by our
countenance, or advance by our favour, or make happy by our presents. We have nothing but ourselves. This
whole self we must give away; and if it is to be of any value, we must make our friend secure of it for ever. What
an enjoyment, what a happiness, for giver and receiver! With what blessedness does truth of affection invest our
situation! It gives to the transitory life of man a heavenly certainty; it forms the crown and capital of all that we
possess."
While he spoke thus, Mignon had come near him; she threw her little arms round him, and stood with her cheek
resting on his breast. He laid his hand on the child's head, and proceeded: "It is easy for a great man to win our
minds to him; easy to make our hearts his own. A mild and pleasant manner, a manner only not inhuman, will of
itself do wonders: and how many means does he possess of holding fast the affections he has once conquered! To
us, all this occurs less frequently, to us it is all more difficult; and we naturally therefore put a greater value on
whatever, in the way of mutual kindness, we acquire and accomplish. What touching examples of faithful servants
giving themselves up to danger and death for their masters! How finely has Shakspeare painted out such things to
us! Fidelity, in this case, is the effort of a noble soul struggling to become equal with one exalted above it. By
stedfast attachment and love, the servant is made equal to his lord, who but for this is justified in looking on him
as a hired slave. Yes, these virtues belong to the lower class of men alone; that class cannot do without them, and
with them it has a beauty of its own. Whoever is enabled to require all favours easily, will likewise easily be
tempted to raise himself above the habit of acknowledgment. Nay, in this sense, I am of opinion, it might almost
be maintained, that a great man may possess friends, but cannot be one."
Mignon pressed still closer towards him.
"It may be so," replied one of the party: "we do not need their friendship, and do not ask it. But it were well if
they understood a little more about the arts which they affect to patronise. When we played in the best style, there
was none to mind us: it was all sheer partiality. Any one they chose to favour pleased; and they did not choose to
favour those that merited to please. It was intolerable to observe how often silliness and mere stupidity attracted
notice and applause."
"When I abate from this," said Wilhelm, "what seemed to spring from irony and malice, I think we may nearly
say, that one fares in art as he does in love. And after all, how shall a fashionable man of the world, with his
dissipated habits, attain that intimate presence with a special object, which an artist must long continue in, if he
would produce anything approaching to perfection? a state of feeling without which it is impossible for any one to
take such an interest, as the artist hopes and wishes, in his work.

Chapter II

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
"Believe me, my friends, it is with talents as with virtue; one must love them for their own sake, or entirely
renounce them. And neither of them is acknowledged and rewarded, except when their possessor can practise
them unseen, like a dangerous secret."
"Meanwhile, until some proper judge discovers us, we may all die of hunger," cried a fellow in the corner.
"Not quite inevitably," answered Wilhelm. "I have observed that so long as one stirs and lives, one always finds
food and raiment, though they be not of the richest sort. And why should we repine? Were we not, altogether
unexpectedly, and when our prospects were the very worst, taken kindly by the hand, and substantially
entertained? And now, when we are in want of nothing, does it once occur to us to attempt anything for our
improvement; or to strive, though never so faintly, towards advancement in our art? We are busied about
indifferent matters; and, like school−boys, we are casting all aside that might bring our lesson to our thoughts."
"In sad truth," said Philina, "it is even so! Let us choose a play; we will go through it on the spot. Each of us must
do his best, as if he stood before the largest audience."
They did not long deliberate; a play was fixed on. It was one of those which at that time were meeting great
applause in Germany, and have now passed away. Some of the party whistled a symphony; each speedily
bethought him of his part; they commenced; and played all the piece with the greatest attention, and really well
beyond expectation. Mutual applauses circulated; our friends had seldom been so pleasantly diverted.
On finishing, they all felt exceedingly contented, partly on account of their time being spent so well, partly
because each of them experienced some degree of satisfaction with his own performance. Wilhelm expressed
himself copiously in their praise; the conversation grew cheerful and merry.
"You would see," cried our friend, "what advances we should make, if we continued this sort of training, and
ceased to confine our attention to mere learning by heart, rehearsing, and playing mechanically, as if it were a
barren duty, or some handicraft employment. How different a character do our musical professors merit! What
interest they take in their art; how correct are they in the practisings they undertake in common! What pains they
are at in tuning their instruments; how exactly they observe time; how delicately they express the strength and the
weakness of their tones! No one there thinks of gaining credit to himself by a loud accompaniment of the solo of
another. Each tries to play in the spirit of the composer, each to express well whatever is committed to him, be it
much or little.
"Should not we too go as strictly and as ingeniously to work, seeing we practise an art far more delicate than that
of music; seeing we are called on to express the commonest and the strangest emotions of human nature, with
elegance, and so as to delight? Can anything be more shocking than to slur over our rehearsal, and in our acting to
depend on good luck, or the capricious chance of the moment? We ought to place our highest happiness and
satisfaction in mutually desiring to gain each other's approbation; we should even value the applauses of the
public only in so far as we have previously sanctioned them among ourselves. Why is the master of the band more
secure about his music than the manager about his play? Because, in the orchestra, each individual would feel
ashamed of his mistakes, which offend the outward ear; but how seldom have I found an actor disposed to
acknowledge or feel ashamed of mistakes, pardonable or the contrary, by which the inward ear is so outrageously
offended! I could wish, for my part, that our theatre were as narrow as the wire of a rope−dancer, that so no inept
fellow might dare to venture on it; instead of being, as it is, a place where every one discovers in himself capacity
enough to flourish and parade."
The company gave this apostrophe a kind reception; each being convinced that the censure conveyed in it could
not apply to him, after acting a little while ago so excellently with the rest. On the other hand, it was agreed that
during this journey, and for the future, if they remained together, they would regularly proceed with their training
in the manner just adopted. Only it was thought, that as this was a thing of good humour and free will, no formal
Chapter II

106

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
manager must be allowed to have a hand in it. Taking it for an established fact, that among good men, the
republican form of government is the best, they declared that the post of manager should go round among them;
he must be chosen by universal suffrage, and every time have a sort of little senate joined in authority along with
him. So delighted did they feel with this idea, that they longed to put it instantly in practice.
"I have no objection," said Melina, "if you incline making such an experiment while we are travelling; I shall
willingly suspend my own directorship until we reach some settled place." He was in hopes of saving cash by this
arrangement, and of casting many small expenses on the shoulders of the little senate or of the interim manager.
This fixed, they went very earnestly to counsel, how the form of the new commonwealth might best be adjusted.
"'Tis an itinerating kingdom," said Laertes; "we shall at least have no quarrels about frontiers."
They directly proceeded to the business, and elected Wilhelm as their first manager. The senate also was
appointed, the women having seat and vote in it; laws were propounded, were rejected, were agreed to. In such
playing, the time passed on unnoticed; and as our friends had spent it pleasantly, they also conceived that they had
really been effecting something useful; and by their new constitution had been opening a new prospect for the
stage of their native country.

Chapter III
SEEING the company so favourably disposed, Wilhelm snow hoped he might farther have it in his power to
converse with them on the poetic merit of the pieces which might come before them. "It is not enough," said he
next day, when they were all again assembled, "for the actor merely to glance over a dramatic work, to judge of it
by his first impression, and thus, without investigation, to declare his satisfaction or dissatisfaction with it. Such
things may be allowed in a spectator, whose purpose it is rather to be entertained and moved than formally to
criticise. But the actor, on the other hand, should be prepared to give a reason for his praise or censure: and how
shall he do this, if he have not taught himself to penetrate the sense, the views and feelings of his author? A
common error is, to form a judgment of a drama from a single part in it; and to look upon this part itself in an
isolated point of view, not in its connexion with the whole. I have noticed this, within a few days, so clearly in my
own conduct, that I will give you the account as an example, if you please to hear me patiently.
"You all know Shakspeare's incomparable Hamlet: our public reading of it at the Castle yielded every one of us
the greatest satisfaction. On that occasion, we proposed to act the piece; and I, not knowing what I undertook,
engaged to play the Prince's part. This I conceived that I was studying, while I began to get by heart the strongest
passages, the soliloquies, and those scenes in which force of soul, vehemence and elevation of feeling have the
freest scope; where the agitated heart is allowed to display itself with touching expressiveness.
"I farther conceived that I was penetrating quite into the spirit of the character, while I endeavoured as it were to
take upon myself the load of deep melancholy under which my prototype was labouring, and in this humour to
pursue him through the strange labyrinths of his caprices and his singularities. Thus learning, thus practising, I
doubted not but I should by and by become one person with my hero.
"But the farther advanced, I advanced, the more difficult did it become for me to form any image of the whole, in
its general bearings; till at last it seemed as if impossible. I next went through the entire piece, without
interruption; but here too I found much that I could not away with. At one time the characters, at another time the
manner of displaying them, seemed inconsistent; and I almost despaired of finding any general tint, in which I
might present my whole part with all its shadings and variations. In such devious paths I toiled, and wandered
long in vain; till at length a hope arose that I might reach my aim in quite a new way.
"I set about investigating every trace of Hamlet's character, as it had shown itself before his father's death: I
Chapter III

107

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
endeavoured to distinguish what in it was independent of this mournful event; independent of the terrible events
that followed; and what most probably the young man would have been, had no such thing occurred.
"Soft, and from a noble stem, this royal flower had sprung up under the immediate influences of majesty: the idea
of moral rectitude with that of princely elevation, the feeling of the good and dignified with the consciousness of
high birth, had in him been unfolded simultaneously. He was a prince, by birth a prince; and he wished to reign,
only that good men might be good without obstruction. Pleasing in form, polished by nature, courteous from the
heart, he was meant to be the pattern of youth and the joy of the world.
"Without any prominent passion, his love for Ophelia was a still presentiment of sweet wants. His zeal in knightly
accomplishments was not entirely his own; it needed to be quickened and inflamed by praise bestowed on others
for excelling in them. Pure in sentiment, he knew the honourable−minded, and could prize the rest which an
upright spirit tastes on the bosom of a friend. To a certain degree, he had learned to discern and value the good
and the beautiful in arts and sciences; the mean, the vulgar was offensive to him; and if hatred could take root in
his tender soul, it was only so far as to make him properly despise the false and changeful insects of a court, and
play with them in easy scorn. He was calm in his temper, artless in his conduct; neither pleased with idleness, nor
too violently eager for employment. The routine of a university he seemed to continue when at court. He
possessed more mirth of humour than of heart; he was a good companion, pliant, courteous, discreet, and able to
forget and forgive and injury; yet never able to unite himself with those who overstept the limits of the right, the
good, and the becoming.
"When we read the piece again, you shall judge whether I am yet on the proper track. I hope at least to bring
forward passages that shall support my opinion in its main points."
This delineation was received with warm approval: the company imagined they foresaw that Hamlet's manner of
proceeding might now be very satisfactorily explained; they applauded this method of penetrating into the spirit
of a writer. Each of them proposed to himself to take up some piece, and study it on these principles, and so
unfold the author's meaning.

Chapter IV
OUR friends had to continue in the place for a day or two; and it was not long till sundry of them got engaged in
adventures of a rather pleasant kind. Laertes in particular was challenged by a lady of the neighbourhood, a
person of some property; but he received her blandishments with extreme, nay unhandsome coldness; and had in
consequence to undergo a multitude of jibes from Philina. She took this opportunity of detailing to our friend the
hapless love−story which had made the youth so bitter a foe to womankind. "Who can take it ill of him," she
cried, "that he hates a sex which has played him so foul, and given him to swallow, in one stoutly concentrated
potion, all the miseries that man can fear from woman? Do but conceive it: within four and twenty hours he was
lover, bridegroom, husband, cuckold, patient and widower! I wot not how you could use a man worse."
Laertes hastened from the room half−vexed, half−laughing; and Philina in her sprightliest style began to relate the
story: how Laertes, a young man of eighteen, on joining a company of actors, found in it a girl of fourteen on the
point of departing with her father, who had quarrelled with the manager. How, on the instant, he had fallen
mortally in love; had conjured the father by all possible considerations to remain, promising at length to marry
young woman. How, after a few pleasing hours of groomship, he had accordingly been wedded, and been happy
as he ought; whereupon, next day, while he was occupied at the rehearsal, his wife, according to professional rule,
had honoured him with a pair of horns; and how as he, out of excessive tenderness, hastening home far too soon,
had, alas, found a former lover in his place, he had struck into the affair with thoughtless indignation, had called
out both father and lover, and sustained a grievous wound in the duel. How father and daughter had thereupon set
off by night, leaving him behind to labour with a double hurt. How the leech he applied to was unhappily the
Chapter IV

108

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
worst in nature; and the poor fellow had got out of the adventure with blackened teeth and watering eyes. That he
was greatly to be pitied, being otherwise the bravest young man on the face of the earth. "Especially," said she, "it
grieves me that the poor soul now hates women; for, hating women, how can one keep living?"
Melina interrupted them with news, that all things being now ready for the journey, they would set out tomorrow
morning. He handed them a plan, arranging how they were to travel.
"If any good friend take me on his lap," said Philina, "I shall be content, though we sit crammed together never so
close and sorrily: 'tis all one to me."
"It does not signify," observed Laertes, who now entered. "It is pitiful," said Wilhelm, hastening away. By the aid
of money he secured another very comfortable coach, though Melina had pretended that there were no more. A
new distribution then took place; and our friends were rejoicing in the thought that they should now travel
pleasantly, when intelligence arrived that a party of military volunteers had been seen upon the road, from whom
little good could be expected.
In the town, these tidings were received with great attention, though they were but variable and ambiguous. As the
contending armies were at that time placed, it seemed impossible that any hostile corps could have advanced, or
any friendly on hung arear, so far. Yet every man was eager to exhibit to our travellers the danger that awaited
them as truly dangerous; every man was eager to suggest that some other route might be adopted.
By these means, most of our friends had been seized with anxiety and fear; and when, according to the new
republican constitution, the whole members of the state had been called together to take counsel on this
extraordinary case, they were almost unanimously of opinion that it would be proper either to keep back the
mischief by abiding where they were, or to evade it by choosing another road.
Wilhelm alone, not participating in the panic, regarded it as mean to abandon, for the sake of mere rumours, a
plan which they had not entered on without much thought. He endeavoured to put heart into them; his reasons
were manly and convincing.
"It is but a rumour," he observed; "and how many such arise in time of war! Well−informed people say that the
occurrence is exceedingly improbable, nay almost impossible. Shall we, in so important a matter, allow a vague
report to determine our proceedings? The route pointed out to us by the Count, and to which our passport was
adapted, is the shortest and in the best condition. It leads us to the town, where you see acquaintances, friends
before you, and may hope for a good reception. The other way will also bring us thither; but by what a circuit, and
along what miserable roads! Have we any right to hope, that, in this late season of the year, we shall get on at all;
and what time and money shall we squander in the mean while!" He added many more considerations, presenting
the matter on so many advantageous sides, that their fear began to dissipate, and their courage to increase. He
talked to them so much about the discipline of regular troops, he painted the marauders and wandering rabble so
contemptuously, and represented the danger itself as so pleasant and inspiring, that the spirits of the party were
altogether cheered.
Laertes from the first had been of his opinion; he now declared that he would not flinch or fail. Old Boisterous
found a consenting phrase or two to utter, in his own vein; Philina laughed at them all; and Madam Melina, who,
notwithstanding her advanced state of pregnancy, had lost nothing of her natural stout−heartedness, regarded the
proposal as heroic. Herr Melina, moved by this harmonious feeling, hoping also to save somewhat by travelling
the short road which had been first contemplated, did not withstand the general consent; and the project was
agreed to with universal alacrity.
They next began to make some preparations for defence at all hazards. They bought large hangers, and slung them
in well−quilted straps over their shoulders. Wilhelm, farther, stuck a pair of pistols in his girdle. Laertes,
Chapter IV

109

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
independently of this occurrence, had a good gun. They all took the road in the highest glee.
On the second day of their journey, the drivers, who knew the country well, proposed to take their noon's rest in a
certain woody spot of the hills; since the town was far off, and in good weather the hill road was generally
preferred.
The day being beautiful, all easily agreed to the proposal. Wilhelm on foot went on before them through the hills;
making every one that met him stare with astonishment at his singular figure. He hastened with quick contented
steps across the forest: Laertes walked whistling after him; none but the women continued to be dragged along in
the carriages. Mignon too ran forward by his side, proud of the hanger, which, when the party were all arming,
she would not go without. Around her hat she had bound the pearl necklace, one of Mariana's reliques, which
Wilhelm still possessed. Friedrich, the fair−haired boy, carried Laertes' gun. The Harper had the most pacific
look; his long cloak was tucked up within his girdle, to let him walk more freely; he leaned upon a knotty staff;
his harp had been left behind him in the carriage.
Immediately on reaching the summit of the height, a task not without its difficulties, our party recognised the
appointed spot, by the fine beech−trees which encircled and screened it. A spacious green, sloping softly in the
middle of the forest, invited one to tarry; a trimly−bordered well offered the most grateful refreshment; and on the
farther side, through chasms in the mountains, and over the tops of the woods, appeared a landscape distant,
lovely, full of hope. Hamlets and mills were lying in the bottoms, villages upon the plain; and a new chain of
mountains, visible in the distance, made the prospect still more significant of hope, for they entered only like a
soft limitation.
The first comers took possession of the place; rested a while in the shade, lighted a fire, and so awaited, singing as
they worked, the remainder of the party; who by degrees arrived, and with one accord saluted the place, the lovely
weather, and the still lovelier scene.

Chapter V
IF our friends had frequently enjoyed a good and merry hour together while within four walls, they were naturally
much gayer here, where the freedom of the sky and the beauty of the place seemed as it were to purify the feelings
of every one. All felt nearer to each other; all wished that they might pass their whole lives in so pleasant an
abode. They envied hunters, charcoal−men and woodcutters; people whom their calling constantly retains in such
happy places: but, above all, they prized the delicious economy of a band of gipsies. They envied these wonderful
companions, entitled to enjoy in blissful idleness all the adventurous charms of nature; they rejoiced at being in
some degree like them.
Meanwhile the women had begun to boil potatoes; and to unwrap and get ready the victuals brought along with
them. Some pots were standing by the fire. The party had placed themselves in groups, under the trees and bushes.
Their singular apparel, their various weapons, gave them a foreign aspect. The horses were eating their provender
at a side. Could one have concealed the coaches, the look of this little horde would have been romantic, even to
complete illusion.
Wilhelm enjoyed a pleasure he had never felt before. He could now imagine his present company to be a
wandering colony, and himself the leader of it. In this character he talked with those around him, and figured out
the fantasy of the moment as poetically as he could. The feelings of the party rose in cheerfulness: they ate and
drank and made merry; and repeatedly declared, that they had never passed more pleasant moments.
Their contentment had not long gone on increasing, till activity awoke among the younger part of them. Wilhelm
and Laertes seized their rapiers, and began to practise, on this occasion with theatrical intentions. They undertook
Chapter V

110

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
to represent the duel, in which Hamlet and his adversary find so tragical an end. Both were persuaded that, in this
powerful scene, it was not enough merely to keep pushing awkwardly hither and thither, as it is generally
exhibited in theatres: they were in hopes to show, by example, how, in presenting it, a worthy spectacle might also
be afforded to the critic in the art of fencing. The rest made a circle round them. Both fought with skill and ardour.
The interest of the spectators rose higher every pass.
But all at once, in the nearest bush, a shot went off; and immediately another; and the party flew asunder in terror.
Next moment, armed men were to be seen pressing forward to the spot where the horses were eating their fodder,
not far from the coaches that were packed with luggage.
A universal scream proceeded from the females: our heroes threw away their rapiers, seized their pistols, and ran
towards the robbers; demanding, with violent threats, the meaning of such conduct.
This question being answered laconically, with a couple of musket−shots, Wilhelm fired his pistol at a
crisp−headed knave, who had got upon the top of the coach, and was cutting the cords of the package. Rightly hit,
this artist instantly came tumbling down: Laertes also had not missed. Both of them, encouraged by success. drew
their side−arms; when a number of the plundering party rushed out upon them, with curses and loud bellowing;
fired a few shots at them, and fronted their impetuosity with glittering sabres. Our young heroes made a bold
resistance. They called upon their other comrades, and endeavoured to excite them to a general resistance. But ere
long, Wilhelm lost the sight of day, and the consciousness of what was passing. Stupefied by a shot that wounded
him between the breast and the left arm, by a stroke that split his hat in two, and almost penetrated to his brain, he
sank down, and only by the narratives of others came afterwards to understand the luckless end of this adventure.
On again opening his eyes, he found himself in the strangest posture. The first thing that pierced the dimness,
which yet swam before his vision, was Philina's face bent down over his. He felt himself weak; and making a
movement to rise, he discovered that he was in Philina's lap; into which, indeed, he again sank down. She was
sitting on the sward. She had softly pressed towards her the head of the fallen young man; and made for him an
easy couch, as far as in her power. Mignon was kneeling with dishevelled and bloody hair at his feet, which she
embraced with many tears.
On noticing his bloody clothes, Wilhelm asked, in a broken voice, where he was, and what had happened to
himself and the rest. Philina begged him to be quiet: the others, she said, were all in safety, and none but he and
Laertes wounded. Farther, she would tell him nothing; but earnestly entreated him to keep still, as his wounds had
been but slightly and hastily bound. He stretched out his hand to Mignon, and inquired about the bloody locks of
the child, who he supposed was also wounded.
For the sake of quietness, Philina let him know that this true−hearted creature, seeing her friend wounded, and in
the hurry of the instant being able to think of nothing which would stanch the blood, had taken her own hair that
was flowing round her head, and tried to stop the wounds with it; but had soon been obliged to give up the vain
attempt: that afterwards they had bound him with moss and dry mushrooms, Philina herself giving up her
neckerchief for that purpose.
Wilhelm noticed that Philina was sitting with her back against her own trunk, which still looked firmly locked and
quite uninjured. He inquired if the rest also had been so lucky as to save their goods? She answered with a shrug
of the shoulders, and a look over the green, where broken chests, and coffers beaten into fragments, and
knapsacks ripped up, and a multitude of little wares, lay scattered all round. No person now was to be seen upon
the place: this strange group formed the only living object in the solitude.
Inquiring farther, our friend learned more and more particulars. The rest of the men, it appeared, who at all events
might still have made resistance, were struck with terror, and soon overpowered. Some fled, some looked with
horror at the accident. The drivers, for the sake of their cattle, had held out more obstinately; but they too were at
Chapter V

111

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
last thrown down and tied; after which, in a few minutes, everything was thoroughly ransacked, and the booty
carried off. The hapless travellers, their fear of death being over, had begun to mourn their loss; and hastened with
the greatest speed to the neighbouring village, taking with them Laertes, whose wounds were slight, and carrying
off but a very few fragments of their property. The Harper having placed his damaged instrument against a tree,
had proceeded in their company to the place; to seek a surgeon, and return with his utmost rapidity to help his
benefactor, whom he had left apparently upon the brink of death.

Chapter VI
MEANWHILE our three adventurers continued yet a space in their strange position, no one returning to their aid.
Evening was advancing; the darkness threatened to come on. Philina's indifference was changing to anxiety;
Mignon ran to and fro, her impatience increasing every moment; and at last, when their prayer was granted, and
human creatures did approach, a new alarm fell upon them. They distinctly heard a troop of horses coming up the
road, which they had lately travelled; they dreaded lest, a second time, some company of unbidden guests might
be purposing to visit this scene of battle, and gather up the gleanings.
The more agreeable was their surprise, when, after a few moments, a young lady issued from the thickets, riding
on a gray courser, and accompanied by an elderly gentleman and some cavaliers. Grooms, servants and a troops
of hussars closed up the rear.
Philina stared at this phenomenon, and was about to call, and entreat the fair Amazon for help; when the latter,
turning her astonished eyes on the group, instantly checked her horse, rode up to them, and halted. She inquired
eagerly about the wounded man, whose posture in the lap of this light−minded Samaritan seemed to strike her as
peculiarly strange.
"Is it your husband?" she inquired of Philina. "Only a good friend," replied the other, with a tone that Wilhelm
liked extremely ill. He had fixed his eyes upon the soft, elevated, calm, sympathising features of the stranger; he
thought he had never seen aught nobler or more lovely. Her shape he could not see: it was hid by a man's white
greatcoat, which she seemed to have borrowed from some of her attendants, to screen her from the chill evening
air.
By this, the horsemen also had come near. Some of them dismounted: the lady did so likewise. She asked, with
humane sympathy, concerning every circumstance of the mishap which had befallen the travellers; but especially
concerning the wounds of the poor youth who lay before her. Thereupon she turned quickly round, and went aside
with the old gentleman to some carriages, which were slowly coming up the hill, and which at length stopped
upon the scene of action.
The young lady having stood with her conductor a short time at the door of one of the coaches, and talked with
the people in it, a man of a squat figure stept out, and came along with them to our wounded hero. By the little
box which he held in his hand, and the leathern pouch with instruments in it, you soon recognised him for a
surgeon. His manners were rude rather than attractive; but his hand was light and his help was welcome.
Having examined strictly, he declared that none of the wounds were dangerous. He would dress them, he said, on
the spot; after which the patient might be carried to the nearest village.
The anxious attentions of the young lady seemed to augment.
"Do but look," she said, after going to and fro once or twice, and again bringing the old gentleman to the place;
"look how they have treated him? And is it not on our account that he is suffering?" Wilhelm heard these words,
but did not understand them. She went restlessly up and down: it seemed as if she could not tear herself away
Chapter VI

112

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
from the presence of the wounded man, while at the same time she feared to violate decorum by remaining, when
they had begun, though not without difficulty, to remove some part of his apparel. The surgeon was just cutting
off the left sleeve of his patient's coat, when the old gentleman came near, and represented to the lady, in a serious
tone, the necessity of proceeding on their journey. Wilhelm kept his eyes bent on her; and was so enchanted with
her looks, that he scarcely felt what he was suffering or doing.
Philina, in the mean time, had risen up to kiss the hand of this kind young lady. While they stood beside each
other, Wilhelm thought he had never seen such a contrast. Philina had never till now appeared in so unfavourable
a light. She had no right, as it seemed to him, to come near that noble creature, still less to touch her.
The lady asked Philina various things, but in an under tone. At length she turned to the old gentleman, and said,
"Dear uncle, may I be generous at your expense?" She took off the greatcoat, with the visible intention to give it
to the stript and wounded youth.
Wilhelm, whom the healing look of her eyes had hitherto held fixed, was now, as the surtout fell away, astonished
at her lovely figure. She came near, and softly laid the coat above him. At this moment, as he tried to open his
mouth, and stammer out some words of gratitude, the lively impression of her presence worked so strongly on his
senses, already caught and bewildered, that all at once it appeared to him as if her head were encircled with rays;
and a glancing light seemed by degrees to spread itself over all her form. At this moment the surgeon, making
preparations to extract the ball from his wound, gave him a sharper twinge: the angel faded away from the eyes of
the fainting patient; he lost all consciousness; and on returning to himself, the horseman and coaches, the fair one
with her attendants, had vanished like a dream.

Chapter VII
WILHELM'S wounds once dressed, and his clothes put on, the surgeon hastened off; just as the Harper with a
number of peasants arrived. Out of some cut boughts, which they speedily wattled with twigs, a kind of litter was
constructed; upon which they placed the wounded youth, and under the conduct of a mounted huntsman, whom
the noble company had left behind them, carried him softly down the mountain. The Harper, silent and shrouded
in his own thoughts, bore with him his broken instrument. Some men brought on Philina's box, herself following
with a bundle. Mignon skipped along through copse and thicket, now before the party, now beside them, and
looked up with longing eyes at her hurt protector.
He meanwhile, wrapped in his warm surtout, was lying peacefully upon the litter. An electric warmth seemed to
flow from the fine wool into his body: in short, he felt himself in the most delightful frame of mind. The lovely
being, whom this garment lately covered, had affected him to the very heart. He still saw the coat falling down
from her shoulders; saw that noble form, begirt with radiance, stand beside him; and his soul hied over rocks and
forests on the footsteps of his vanished benefactress.
It was nightfall when the party reached the village, and halted at the door of the inn where the rest of the company
in the gloom of despondency, were bewailing their irreparable loss. The one little chamber of the house was
crammed with people. Some of them were lying upon straw; some were occupying benches; some had squeezed
themselves behind the stove. Frau Melina, in a neighbouring room, was painfully expecting her delivery. Fright
had accelerated this event. With the sole assistance of the landlady, a young inexperienced woman, nothing good
could be expected.
As the party just arrived required admission, there arose a universal murmur. All now maintained, that by
Wilhelm's advice alone, and under his especial guidance, they had entered on this dangerous road, and exposed
themselves to such misfortunes. They threw the blame of the disaster wholly on him; they stuck themselves in the
door to oppose his entrance, declaring that he must go elsewhere and seek quarters. Philina they received with still
Chapter VII

113

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
greater indignation: nor did Mignon and the Harper escape their share.
The huntsman, to whom the care of the forsaken party had been earnestly and strictly recommended by his
beautiful mistress, soon grew tired of this discussion: he rushed upon the company with oaths and menaces;
commanding them to fall to the right and left and make way for this new arrival. They now began to pacify
themselves. He made a place for Wilhelm on a table, which he shoved into a corner; Philina had her box put there,
and then sat down upon it. All packed themselves as they best could; and the huntsman went away to see if he
could not find for "the young couple" a more convenient lodging.
Scarcely was he gone, when spite again grew noisy, and one reproach began to follow close upon another. Each
described and magnified his loss; censuring the foolhardiness they had so keenly smarted for. They did not even
hide the malicious satisfaction they felt at Wilhelm's wounds: they jeered Philina, and imputed to her as a crime
the means by which she had saved her trunk. From a multitude of jibes and bitter innuendoes you were required to
conclude, that during the plundering and discomfiture she had endeavoured to work herself into favour with the
captain of the band, and had persuaded him, Heaven knew by what arts and complaisance, to give her back the
chest unhurt. To all this she answered nothing; only clanked with the large paddocks of her box, to impress her
censurers completely with its presence, and by her own good fortune to augment their desperation.

Chapter VIII
THOUGH our friend was weak from loss of blood, and though ever since the appearance of that helpful angel his
feelings had been soft and mild, yet at last he could not help getting vexed at the harsh and unjust speeches which,
as he continued silent, the discontented company went on uttering against him. Feeling himself strong enough to
sit up, and expostulate on the annoyance they were causing to their friend and leader, he raised his bandaged head,
and propping himself with some difficulty, and leaning against the wall, he began to speak as follows:
"Considering the pain which your losses occasion, I forgive you for assailing me with injuries at a moment when
you should condole with me; for opposing me and casting me from you, the first time I have needed to look to
you for help. The services I did you, the complaisance I showed you, I regarded as sufficiently repaid by your
thanks, by your friendly conduct: do not warp my thoughts, do not force my heart to go back and calculate what I
have done for you; the calculation would be painful to me. Chance brought me near you, circumstances and a
secret inclination kept me with you. I participated in your labours and your pleasures: my slender abilities were
ever at your service. If you now blame me with bitterness for the mishap that has befallen us, you do not recollect
that the first project of taking this road came to us from stranger people, was tried by all of you, and sanctioned by
every one as well as me.
"Had our journey ended happily, each would have taken credit to himself for the happy thought of suggesting this
plan and preferring it to others; each would joyfully have put us in mind of our deliberations and of the vote he
gave: but now you make me alone responsible; you force a piece of blame upon me, which I would willingly
submit to, if my conscience with a clear voice did not pronounce me innocent, nay if I might not appeal with
safety even to yourselves. If you have aught to say against me, bring it forward in order, and I shall defend
myself; if you have nothing reasonable to allege, then be silent, and do not torment me now when I have such
pressing need of rest."
By way of answer, the girls once more began whimpering and whining, and describing their losses
circumstantially. Melina was quite beside himself; for he had suffered more in purse than any of them; more
indeed than we can rightly estimate. He stamped like a madman up and down the little room, he knocked his head
against the wall, he swore and scolded in the most unseemly manner; and the landlady entering at this very time
with news, that his wife had been delivered of a dead child, he yielded to the most furious ebullitions, while in
accordance with him all howled and shrieked and bellowed and uproared with double vigour.
Chapter VIII

114

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Wilhelm, touched to the heart at once with sympathy in their sorrows, and with vexation at their mean way of
thinking, felt all the vigour of his soul awakened, notwithstanding the weakness of his body. "Deplorable as your
case may be," exclaimed he, "I shall almost be compelled to despise you. No misfortune gives us right to load an
innocent man with reproaches. If I had share in this false step, am not I suffering my share? I lie wounded here;
and if the company has come to loss, I myself have come to most. The wardrobe of which we have been robbed,
the decorations that are gone, were mine; for you, Herr Melina, have not yet paid me, and I here fully acquit you
of all obligation in that matter."
"It is well to give what none of us will ever see again," replied Melina. "Your money was lying in my wife's
coffer, and it is your own blame that you have lost it. But ah! if that were all!"−And thereupon he began anew to
stamp and scold and squeal. Every one recalled to memory the superb clothes from the Count's wardrobe; the
buckles, watches, snuff−boxes, hats, for which Melina had so happily transacted with the head valet. Each then
thought also of his own, though far inferior treasures. They looked with spleen at Philina's box; and gave Wilhelm
to understand, that he had indeed done wisely to connect himself with that fair personage, and to save his own
goods also, under the shadow of her fortune.
"Do you think," he exclaimed at last, "that I shall keep anything apart while you are starving? And is this the first
time I have honestly shared with you in a season of need? Open the trunk; all that is mine shall go to supply the
common wants."
"It is my trunk," observed Philina, "and I will not open it till I please. Your rag or two of clothes, which I have
saved for you, could amount to little, though they were sold to the most conscientious of Jews. Think of yourself;
what your cure will cost, what may befall you in a strange country."
"You, Philina," answered Wilhelm, "will keep back from me nothing that is mine; and that little will help us out
of the first perplexity. But a man possesses many things besides coined money to assist his friends with. All that is
in me shall be devoted to these hapless persons; who doubtless, on returning to their senses, will repent their
present conduct. Yes," continued he, "I feel that you have need of help, and what is mine to do, I will perform.
Give me your confidence again; compose yourselves for a moment, and accept of what I promise! Who will
receive the engagement of me in the name of all?"
Here he stretched out his hand and cried: "I promise not to flinch from you, never to forsake you till each shall see
his losses doubly and trebly repaired; till the situation you are fallen into, by whose blame soever, shall be totally
forgotten by all of you, and changed for a better."
He kept his hand still stretched out: but no one would take hold of it. "I promise it again," cried he, sinking back
upon his pillow. All continued silent: they felt ashamed, but nothing comforted; and Philina, sitting on her chest,
kept cracking nuts, a stock of which she had discovered in her pocket.

THE HUNTSMAN now came back with several people, and made preparations for carrying away the wounded
youth. He had persuaded the parson of the place to receive the "young couple" into his house; Philina's trunk was
taken out; she followed with a natural air of dignity. Mignon ran before; and when the patient reached the
parsonage, a wide couch, which had long been standing ready as guest's bed and bed of honour, was assigned him.
Here it was first discovered, that his wound had opened and bled profusely. A new bandage was required for it.
He fell into a feverish state; Philina waited on him faithfully; and when fatigue overpowered her, she was relieved
by the Harper. Mignon, with the firmest purpose to watch, had fallen asleep in a corner.
Next morning, Wilhelm, who felt himself in some degree refreshed, learned by inquiring of the huntsman, that the
Chapter IX

115

honourable persons who last night assisted him so nobly, had shortly before left their estates, in order to avoid the
movements of the contending armies, and remain till the time of peace in some more quiet district. He named the
elderly nobleman as well as his niece; mentioned the place they were first going to; and told how the young lady
had charged him to take care of Wilhelm.
The entrance of the surgeon interrupted the warm expressions of gratitude, in which our friend was pouring out
his feelings. He made a circumstantial description of the wounds; and certified that they would soon heal, if the
patient took care of them, and kept himself at peace.
When the huntsman was gone, Philina signified that he had left with her a purse of twenty louis−d'or; that he had
given the parson a remuneration for their lodging, and left with him money to defray the surgeon's bill when the
cure should be completed. She added, that she herself passed everywhere for Wilhelm's wife: that she now begged
leave to introduce herself once for all to him in this capacity, and would not allow him to look out for any other
sick−nurse.
"Philina," said Wilhelm, "in this disaster that has overtaken us, I am already deeply in your debt for kindness
shown me; and I should not wish to see my obligations increased. I am restless so long as you are near me: for I
know of nothing by which I can repay your labour. Give me my things which you have saved in your trunk; unite
yourself to the rest of the company; seek another lodging, take my thanks, and the gold watch as a small
acknowledgment: only leave me; your presence disturbs me more than you can fancy."
She laughed in his face when he had ended. "Thou art a fool," she said; "thou wilt not gather wisdom. I know
better what is good for thee; I will stay, I will not budge from the spot. I have never counted on the gratitude of
men, and therefore not on thine; and if I have a touch of kindness for thee, what hast thou to do with it?"
She stayed accordingly; and soon wormed herself into favour with the parson and his household; being always
cheerful, having the knack of giving little presents, and of talking to each in his own vein; at the same time always
contriving to do exactly what she pleased. Wilhelm's state was not uncomfortable: the surgeon, an ignorant but no
unskilful man, let nature play her part; and the patient was not long till he felt himself recovering. For such a
consummation, being eager to pursue his plans and wishes, he vehemently longed.
Incessantly he kept recalling that event, which had made an ineffaceable impression on his heart. He saw the
beautiful Amazon again come riding out of the thickets; she approached him, dismounted, went to and fro, and
strove to serve him. He saw the garment she was wrapt in fall down from her shoulders; he saw her countenance,
her figure vanish in their radiance. All the dreams of his youth now fastened on this image. Here he conceived he
had at length beheld the noble, the heroic Clorinda with his own eyes: and again he bethought him of that royal
youth, to whose sickbed the lovely sympathising princess came in her modest meekness.
"May it not be," said he often to himself in secret, "that in youth as in sleep, the images of coming things hover
round us, and mysteriously become visible to our unobstructed eyes? May not the seeds of what is to betide us be
already scattered by the hand of Fate; may not a foretaste of the fruits we yet hope to gather possibly be given
us?"
His sickbed gave him leisure to repeat those scenes in every mood. A thousand times he called back the tone of
that sweet voice; a thousand times he envied Philina, who had kissed that helpful hand. Often the whole incident
appeared before him as a dream; and he would have reckoned it a fiction, if the white surtout had not been left
behind to convince him that the vision had a real existence.
With the greatest care for this piece of apparel, he combined the greatest wish to wear it. The first time he arose
he put it on; and was kept in fear all day lest it might be hurt by some stain or other injury.

LAERTES visited his friend. He had not assisted in that lively scene at the inn, being then confined to bed in an
upper chamber. For his loss he was already in a great degree consoled; he helped himself with his customary:
"What does it signify?" He detailed various laughable particulars about the company; particularly charging Frau
Melina with lamenting the loss of her still−born daughter, solely because she herself could not on that account
enjoy the Old−German satisfaction of having a Mechthilde christened. As for her husband, it now appeared that
he had been possessed of abundant cash; and even at first had by no means needed the advances which he had
cajoled from Wilhelm. Melina's present plan was to set off by the next Postwagen; and he meant to require of
Wilhelm an introductory letter to his friend, the Manager Serlo, in whose company, the present undertaking
having gone to wreck, he now wished to establish himself.
For some days Mignon had been singularly quiet; when pressed with questions, she at length admitted that her
right arm was out of joint. "Thou hast thy own folly to thank for that," observed Philina, and then told how the
child had drawn her sword in the battle; and seeing her friend in peril, had struck fiercely at the freebooters; one
of whom had at length seized her by the arm, and pitched her to a side. They chid her for not sooner speaking of
her ailment; but they easily saw that she was apprehensive of the surgeon, who had hitherto looked on her as a
boy. With a view to remove the mischief, she was made to keep her arm in a sling; which arrangement too
displeased her; for now she was obliged to surrender most part of her share in the management and nursing of our
friend to Philina. That pleasing sinner but showed herself the more active and attentive on this account.
One morning, on awakening, Wilhelm found himself in a strange neighbourhood with her. In the movements of
sleep he had hitched himself quite to the back of his spacious bed. Philina was lying across from the front part of
it; she seemed to have fallen asleep while sitting on the bed and reading. A book had dropped from her hand; she
had sunk back, and her head was lying near his breast, over which her fair and now loosened hair was spread in
streams. The disorder of sleep enlivened her charms more than heart or purpose could have done; a childlike
smiling rest hovered on her countenance. He looked at her for a time; and seemed to blame himself for the
pleasure which this gave him. He had viewed her attentively for some moments, when she began to awake. He
softly closed his eyes; but could not help glimmering at her through his eyelashes, as she trimmed herself again,
and went away to consult about breakfast.
All the actors had at length successively announced themselves to Wilhelm; asking introductory letters, requiring
money for their journey with more or less impatience and ill−breeding; and constantly receiving it against
Philina's will. It was in vain for her to tell our friend, that the huntsman had already left a handsome sum with
these people, and that accordingly they did but cozen him. To these remonstrances he gave no heed; on the
contrary, the two had a sharp quarrel on the subject; which ended by Wilhelm signifying once for all, that Philina
must now join the rest of the company, and seek her fortune with Serlo.
For an instant or two she lost temper; but speedily recovering her composure, she cried: "If I had but my
fair−haired boy again, I should not care a fig for any of you." She meant Friedrich, who had vanished from the
scene of battle, and never since appeared. Next morning Mignon brought news to the bedside, that Philina had
gone off by night, leaving all that belonged to Wilhelm very neatly laid out in the next room. He felt her absence!
he had lost in her a faithful nurse, a cheerful companion; he was no longer used to be alone. But Mignon soon
filled up the blank.
Ever since that light−minded beauty had been near the patient with her friendly cares, the little creature had by
degrees drawn back, and remained silent and secluded in herself; but the field being clear once more, she again
came forth with her attentions and her love; again was eager in serving, and lively in entertaining him.

Chapter XI
WILHELM was rapidly approaching complete recovery: he now hoped to be upon his journey in a few days. He
proposed no more to lead an aimless routine of existence: the steps of his career were henceforth to be calculated
for an end. In the first place, he purposed to seek out that beneficent lady, and express the gratitude he felt to her;
then to proceed without delay to his friend the Manager, that he might do his utmost to assist the luckless
company; intending at the same time to visit the commercial friends whom he had letters for, and to transact the
business which had been intrusted to him. He was not without hope that fortune, as formerly, would favour him;
and give him opportunity, by some lucky speculation, to repaid his losses, and fill up the vacuity of his coffer.
The desire of again beholding his beautiful deliverer augmented every day. To settle his route, he took counsel
with the clergyman, a person well skilled in statistics and geography, and possessing a fine collection of charts
and books on those subjects. They two searched for the place which this noble family had chosen as their
residence while the war continued; they searched for information respecting the family itself. But their place was
to be found in no geography or map; and the heraldic manuals made no mention of their name. Wilhelm became
restless; and having mentioned the cause of his uneasiness, the Harper told him he had reason to believe that the
huntsman, for whatever reason, had concealed the real designations.
Conceiving himself now to be in the immediate neighbourhood of his lovely benefactress, Wilhelm hoped he
might obtain some tidings of her, if he sent out the Harper: but in this too he was deceived. Diligently as the old
man kept inquiring, he could find no trace of her. Of late days a number of quick movements and unforeseen
marches had taken place in that quarter; no one had particularly noticed the travelling party; and the ancient
messenger, to avoid being taken for a Jewish spy, was obliged to return, and appear without any olive−leaf before
his master and friend. He gave a strict account of his conduct in this commission, striving to keep far from him all
suspicions of remissness. He endeavoured by every means to mitigate the trouble of our friend; bethought him of
everything that he had learned from the huntsman, and advanced a number of conjectures; out of all which, one
circumstance at length came to light, whereby Wilhelm could explain some enigmatic words of his vanished
benefactress.
The freebooters, it appeared, had lain in wait, not for the wandering troop, but for that noble company, whom they
rightly guessed to be provided with store of gold and valuables, and of whose movements they must have had
precise intelligence. Whether the attack should be imputed to some freecorps, to marauders, or to robbers, was
uncertain. It was clear, however, that by good fortune for the high and rich company, the poor and low had first
arrived upon the place, and undergone the fate which was provided for the others. It was to this that the lady's
words referred, which Wilhelm yet well recollected. If he might now be happy and contented, that a prescient
Genius had selected him for the sacrifice, which saved a perfect mortal; he was, on the other hand, nigh desperate,
when he thought that all hope of finding her and seeing her again was, at least for the present, completely gone.
What increased this singular emotion still farther, was the likeness which he thought he had observed between the
Countess and the beautiful unknown. They resembled one another, as two sisters may, of whom neither can be
called the younger or the elder, for they seem to be twins.
The recollection of the amiable Countess was to Wilhelm infinitely sweet. He recalled her image but too willingly
into his memory. But anon the figure of the noble Amazon would step between; one vision melted and changed
into the other, and the form of neither would abide with him.
A new resemblance, the similarity of their handwritings, naturally struck him with still greater wonder. He had a
charming song in the Countess's hand laid up his portfolio; and in the surtout he had found a little note, inquiring
with much tender care about the health of an uncle.

Chapter XI

118

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Wilhelm was convinced that his benefactress must have penned this billet; that it must have been sent from one
chamber to another, at some inn during their journey, and put into the coat−pocket by the uncle. He held both
papers together; and if the regular and graceful letters of the Countess had already pleased him much, he found in
the similar but freer lines of the stranger a flowing harmony which could not be described. The note contained
nothing; yet the strokes of it seemed to affect him, as the presence of their fancied writer once had done.
He fell into a dreamy longing; and well accordant with his feelings was the song which at that instant Mignon and
the Harper began to sing, with a touching expression, in the form of an irregular duet:You never long'd and
lov'dYou know not grief like mine:Alone and far remov'dFrom joys or hopes, I pine:A foreign sky above,And a
foreign earth below me,To the south I look all day;For the hearts that love and know meAre far, are far away.I
burn, I faint, I languish,My heart is waste, and sick, and sore;Who has not long'd in baffled anguishCannot know
what I deplore.

Chapter XII
THE SOFT allurements of his dear presiding angel, far from leading our friend to any one determined path, did
but nourish and increase the unrest which he had previously experienced. A secret fire was gliding through his
veins; objects distinct and indistinct alternated within his soul, and awoke unspeakable desire. At one time he
wished for a horse, at another for wings; and not till it seemed impossible that he could stay, did he look round
him to discover whither he was wanting to go.
The threads of his destiny had become so strangely entangled, he wished to see its curious knots unravelled or cut
in two.
Often, when he heard the tramp of a horse or the rolling of a carriage, he would run to the window and look out,
in hopes it might be some one seeking him; some one, even though it were by chance, bringing him intelligence
and certainty and joy. He told stories to himself, how his friend Werner might visit these parts and come upon
him; how perhaps Mariana might appear. The sound of every post's horn threw him into agitation. It would be
Melina sending news to him of his adventures; above all, it would be the huntsman coming back to carry him to
the beauty whom he worshipped.
Of all these possibilities, unhappily no one occurred: he was forced at last to return to the company of himself;
and in again looking through the past, there was one circumstance, which the more he viewed and weighed it,
grew the more offensive and intolerable to him. It was his unprosperous generalship, of which he never thought
without vexation. For although, on the evening of that luckless day, he had produced a pretty fair defence of his
conduct when accused by the company, yet he could not hide from himself that he was guilty. On the contrary, in
hypochondriacal moments he took the blame of the whole misfortune.
Self−love exaggerates our faults as well as our virtues. Wilhelm thought he had awakened confidence in him, had
guided the will of the rest; that, led by inexperience and rashness, they had ventured on, till a danger seized them,
for which they were not match. Loud as well as silent reproaches had then assailed him: and if in their sorrowful
condition he had promised to the company, misguided by him, never to forsake them till their loss had been repaid
with usury; this was but another folly for which he had to blame himself, the folly of presuming to take upon his
single shoulders a misfortune that was spread over many. One instant he accused himself of uttering this promise,
under the excitement and the pressure of the moment; the next he again felt that this generous presentation of his
hand, which no one deigned to accept, was but a light formality compared with the vow which his heart had taken.
He meditated means of being kind and useful to them; he found every cause conspire to quicken his visit to Serlo.
Accordingly he packed his things together; and without waiting his complete recovery, without listening to the
counsel of the parson or the surgeon, he hastened, in the strange society of Mignon and the Harper, to escape the
inactivity, in which his fate had once more too long detained him.
Chapter XII

Chapter XIII
SERLO received him with open arms, crying as he met him: "Is it you? Do I see you again? You have scarcely
changed at all. Is your love for that noblest of arts still as lively and strong? I myself am so glad at your arrival, I
even feel no longer the mistrust which your last letters had excited in me."
Wilhelm asked with surprise for a clearer explanation.
"You have treated me," said Serlo, "not like an old friend, but as if I were a great lord, to whom with a safe
conscience you might recommend useless people. Our destiny depends on the opinion of the public; and I fear
Herr Melina and his suite can hardly be received among us."
Wilhelm tried to say something in their favour; but Serlo began to draw so merciless a picture of them, that our
friend was happy when a lady came into the room, and put a stop to the discussion. She was introduced to him as
Aurelia, the sister of his friend: she received him with extreme kindness; and her conversation was so pleasing,
that he did not once remark a shade of sorrow visible on her expressive countenance, to which it lent peculiar
interest.
For the first time during many months, Wilhelm felt himself in his proper element once more. Of late in talking,
he had merely found submissive listeners, and even these not always; but now he had the happiness to speak with
critics and artists, who not only fully understood him, but repaid his observations by others equally instructive.
With wonderful vivacity they travelled through the latest pieces; with wonderful correctness judged them. The
decisions of the public they could try and estimate: they speedily threw light on each other's thoughts.
Loving Shakspeare as our friend did, he failed not to lead round the conversation to the merits of that dramatist.
Expressing, as he entertained, the liveliest hopes of the new epoch which these exquisite productions must form in
Germany he ere long introduced his Hamlet, who had busied him so much of late.
Serlo declared that he would long ago have played the piece, had this been possible, and that he himself would
willingly engage to act Polonius. He added, with a smile: "An Ophelia, too, will certainly turn up, if we had but a
Prince."
Wilhelm did not notice that Aurelia seemed a little hurt at her brother's sarcasm. Our friend was in his proper
vein, becoming copious and didactic, expounding how he would have Hamlet played. He circumstantially
delivered to his hearers the opinions we before saw him busied with; taking all the trouble possible to make his
notion of the matter acceptable, sceptical as Serlo showed himself regarding it.
"Well, then," said the latter, finally, "suppose we grant you all this, what will you explain by it?"
"Much, everything," said Wilhelm. "Conceive a prince such as I have painted him, and that his father suddenly
dies. Ambition and the love of rule are not the passions that inspire him. As a king's son he would have been
contented; but now he is first constrained to consider the difference which separates a sovereign from a subject.
The crown was not hereditary; yet a longer possession of it by his father would have strengthened the pretensions
of an only son, and secured his hopes of the succession. In place of this, he now beholds himself excluded by his
uncle, in spite of specious promises, most probably forever. He is now poor in goods and favour, and a stranger in
the scene which from youth he had looked upon as his inheritance. His temper here assumes its first mournful
tinge. He feels that now he is not more, that he is less, than a private nobleman; he offers himself as the servant of
every one; he is not courteous and condescending, he is needy and degraded.
"His past condition he remembers as a vanished dream. It is in vain that his uncle strives to cheer him, to present
Chapter XIII

120

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
his situation in another point of view. The feeling of his nothingness will not leave him.
"The second stroke that came upon him wounded deeper, bowed still more. It was the marriage of his mother. The
faithful tender son had yet a mother, when his father passed away. He hoped, in the company of his surviving
nobleminded parent, to reverence the heroic form of the departed; but his mother too he loses, and it is something
worse than death that robs him of her. The trustful image, which a good child loves to form of its parents, is gone.
With the dead there is no help; on the living no hold. She also is a woman, and her name is Frailty, like that of all
her sex.
"Now first does he feel himself completely bent and orphaned; and no happiness of life can repay what he has
lost. Not reflective or sorrowful by nature, reflection and sorrow have become for him a heavy obligation. It is
thus that we see him first enter on the scene. I do not think that I have mixed aught foreign with the piece, or
overcharged a single feature of it."
Serlo looked at his sister, and said, "Did I give thee a false picture of our friend? He begins well; he has still many
things to tell us, many to persuade us of." Wilhelm asseverated loudly, that he meant not to persuade, but to
convince; he begged for another moment's patience.
"Figure to yourselves this youth," cried he, "this son of princes: conceive him vividly, bring his state before your
eyes, and then observe him when he learns that his father's spirit walks; stand by him in the terrors of the night,
when the venerable ghost itself appears before him. A horrid shudder passes over him; he speaks to the
mysterious form; he sees it beckon him; he follows it, and hears. The fearful accusation of his uncle rings in his
ears; the summons to revenge, and the piercing off repeated prayer, Remember me!
"And when the ghost has vanished, who is it that stands before us? A young hero panting for vengeance? A prince
by birth, rejoicing to be called to punish the usurper of his crown? No! trouble and astonishment take hold of his
solitary young man; he grows bitter against smiling villains, swears that he will not forget the spirit, and
concludes with the significant ejaculation:The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,That ever I was born to set it
right!
"In these words, I imagine, will be found the key to Hamlet's whole procedure. To me it is clear that Shakspeare
meant, in the present case, to represent the effects of a great action laid upon a soul unfit for the performance of it.
In this view the whole piece seems to me to be composed. There is an oak−tree planted in a costly jar, which
should have borne only pleasant flowers in its bosom; the roots expand, the jar is shivered.
A lovely, pure, noble and most moral nature, without the strength of nerve which forms a hero, sinks beneath a
burden which it cannot bear and must not cast away. All duties are holy for him; the present is too hard.
Impossibilities have been required of him; not in themselves impossibilities, but such for him. He winds, and
turns, and torments himself; he advances and recoils; at ever put in mind, ever puts himself in mind; at last does
all but lose his purpose from his thoughts; yet still without recovering his peace of mind."

Chapter XIV
SEVERAL people entering interrupted the discussion. They were musical dilettanti, who commonly assembled at
Serlo's once a week, and formed a little concert. Serlo himself loved music much: he used to maintain, that a
player without taste for it never could attain a distinct conception and feeling of the scenic art. "As a man
performs," he would observe, "with far more ease and dignity, when his gestures are accompanied and guided by
a tune; so the player ought, in idea as it were, to set to music even his prose parts, that he may not monotonously
slight them over in his individual style, but treat them in suitable alternation by time and measure."

Chapter XIV

121

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Aurelia seemed to give but little heed to what was passing; at last, she conducted Wilhelm to another room, and
going to the window, and looking out at the starry sky, she said to him:
"You have still much to tell us about Hamlet; I will not hurry you; my brother must hear it as well as I; but let me
beg to know your thoughts about Ophelia."
"Of her there cannot much be said," he answered; "for a few master−strokes complete her character. The whole
being of Ophelia floats in sweet and ripe sensation. Kindness for the Prince, to whose hand she may aspire, flows
so spontaneously, her tender heart obeys its impulses so unresistingly, that both father and brother are afraid; both
give her warning harshly and directly. Decorum, like the thin lawn upon her bosom, cannot hide the soft, still
movements of her heart; it on the contrary betrays them. Her fancy smit; her silent modesty breathes amiable
desire; and if the friendly goddess Opportunity should shake the tree, is fruit would fall."
"And then," said Aurelia, "when she beholds herself forsaken, cast away, despised; when all is inverted in the soul
of her crazed lover, and the highest changes to the lowest and instead of the sweet cup of love he offers her the
bitter cup of woe−"
"Her heart breaks," cried Wilhelm; "the whole structure of her being is loosened from its joinings; her father's
death strikes fiercely against it; and the fair edifice altogether crumbles into fragments."
Our friend had not observed with what expressiveness Aurelia pronounced those words. Looking only at this
work of art, at its connexion and completeness, he dreamed not that his auditress was feeling quite a different
influence; that a deep sorrow of her own was vividly awakened in her breast by these dramatic shadows.
Aurelia's head was still resting on her arms; and her eyes, now full of tears, were directed to the sky. At last, no
longer able to conceal her secret grief, she seized both hands of her friend, and exclaimed, while he stood
surprised before her:
"Forgive, forgive a heavy heart! I am girt and pressed together by these people; from my hard−hearted brother I
must seek to hide myself; your presence has untied these bonds. My friend!" continued she, "it is but a few
minutes since we saw each other first, and already you are going to become my confidant." She could scarcely
end the words, and sank upon his shoulder. "Think not worse of me," she said with sobs, "that I disclose myself to
you so hastily, that I am so weak before you. Be my friend, remain my friend; I shall deserve it." He spoke to her
in his kindest manner: but in vain; her tears still flowed, and choked her words.
At this moment Serlo entered, most unwelcomely; and most unexpectedly, Philina with her hand in his. "Here is
your friend," said he to her; "he will be glad to make his compliments to you."
"How!" cried Wilhelm in astonishment: "are you here?" With a modest settled mien, she went up to him; bade
him welcome; praised Serlo's goodness, who, she said, without merit on her part, but purely in the hope of her
improvement, had agreed to admit her into his accomplished troop. She behaved, all the while, in a friendly
manner towards Wilhelm, yet with a dignified distance.
But this dissimulation lasted only till the other two were gone. Aurelia having left them, that she might conceal
her trouble, and Serlo being called away, Philina first looked very sharply at the doors, to see that both were really
out; then began skipping to and fro about the room, as if she had been mad; at last dropt down upon the floor, like
to die of giggling and laughing. She then sprang up, patted and flattered our friend; rejoicing above measure that
she had been clever enough to go before, and spy the land get herself nestled in.
"Pretty things are going on here," she said; "just of the sort I like. Aurelia has had a hapless love−affair with some
nobleman, who seems to be a very stately person, one whom I myself could like to see, some day. He has left her
Chapter XIV

a memorial, or I much mistake. There is a boy running about the house, of three years old or so: the papa must be
a very pretty fellow. Commonly I cannot suffer children, but this brat quite delights me. I have calculated
Aurelia's business. The death of her husband, the new acquaintance, the child's age, all things agree.
"But now her spark has gone his ways; for a year she has not seen a glimpse of him. She is beside herself and
inconsolable, on this account. The more fool she! Her brother has a dancing girl in his troop, with whom he stands
on pretty terms; an actress to whom he is betrothed; in the town, some other women whom he courts; I too am on
his list. The more fool he! Of the rest thou shalt hear tomorrow. And now one word about Philina, whom thou
knowest: the arch−fool is fallen in love with thee." She swore that it was true, and a proper joke. She earnestly
requested Wilhelm to fall in love with Aurelia; for then the chase would be worth beholding. "She pursues her
faithless swain, thou her, I thee, her brother me. If that will not divert us for a quarter of a year, I engage to die at
the first episode which occurs in this four−times complicated tale." She begged of him not to spoil her trade, and
to show her such respect as her external conduct should deserve.

Chapter XV
NEXT morning Wilhelm went to visit Frau Melina; but found her not at home. On inquiring here for the other
members of the wandering community, he learned that Philina had invited them to breakfast. Out of curiosity, he
hastened thither; and found them all cleared up and not a little comforted. The cunning creature had collected
them, was treating them with chocolate, and giving them to understand that some prospects still remained for
them; that, by her influence, she hoped to convince the manager how advantageous it would be for him to
introduce so many clever hands among his company. They listened to her with attention; swallowed cup after cup
of her chocolate; thought the girl was not so bad after all; and went away proposing to themselves to speak
whatever good of her they could.
"Do you think then," said our friend, who stayed behind, "that Serlo will determine to retain our comrades?" "Not
at all," replied Philina; "nor do I care a fig for it. The sooner they are gone the better! Laertes alone I could wish to
keep: the rest we shall by and by pack off."
Next she signified to Wilhelm her firm persuasion that he should no longer hide his talent; but, under the direction
of a Serlo, go upon the boards. She was lavish in this establishment: she spoke so flatteringly to Wilhelm; with
such admiration of his gifts, that his heart and his imagination were advancing towards this proposal, as fast as his
understanding and his reason were retreating from it. He concealed his inclination from himself and from Philina;
and passed a restless day, unable to resolve on visiting his trading correspondents, to receive the letters which
might there be lying for him. The anxieties of his people during all this time he easily conceived; yet he shrank
from the precise account of them; particularly at the present time, as he promised to himself a great and pure
enjoyment from the exhibition of a new piece that evening.
Serlo had refused to let him witness the rehearsal. "You must see us on the best side," he observed, "before we
can allow you to look into our cards."
The acting of the piece, however, where our friend did not fail to be present, yielded him a high satisfaction. It
was the first time he had ever seen a theatre in such perfection. The actors were evidently all possessed of
excellent gifts, of superior capacities, and a high clear notion of their art: they were not equal; but they mutually
restrained and supported one another; each breathed ardour into those around him; throughout all their acting,
they showed themselves decided and correct. You soon felt that Serlo was the soul of the whole; as an individual
he appeared to much advantage. A merry humour, a measured vivacity, a settled feeling of propriety, combined
with a great gift of imitation, were to be observed in him the moment he appeared upon the stage. The inward
contentment of his being seemed to spread itself over all that looked on him; and the intellectual style, in which he
could so easily and gracefully express the finest shadings of his part, excited more delight, as he could conceal the

art which, by long−continued practice, he had made his own.
Aurelia, his sister, was not inferior; she obtained still greater approbation, for she touched the souls of the
audience, which it was his to exhilarate and amuse.
After a few days had passed pleasantly enough, Aurelia sent to inquire for our friend. He hastened to her: she was
lying on sofa; she seemed to be suffering from headache: her whole frame had visibly a feverish movement. Her
eye lighted up as she noticed Wilhelm. "Pardon me!" she cried, as he entered: "the trust you have inspired me
with has made me weak. Till now I have contrived to bear up against my woes in secret; nay, they gave me
strength and consolation: but now, I know not how it is, you have loosened the bands of silence; you must, against
your will, take part in the battle I am fighting with myself."
Wilhelm answered her in friendly and obliging terms. He declared that her image and her sorrows had not ceased
to hover in his thoughts; that he longed for her confidence, and devoted himself to be her friend.
While he spoke, his eyes were attracted to the boy, who sat before her on the floor, and was busy rattling a
multitude of playthings. This child, as Philina had observed, might be about three years of age; and Wilhelm now
conceived how that giddy creature, seldom elevated in her phraseology, had likened it to the sun. For its cheerful
eyes and full countenance were shaded by the finest golden locks, which flowed round in copious curls; dark,
slender, softly−bending eyebrows showed themselves upon a brow of dazzling whiteness; and the living tinge of
health was glancing on its cheeks. child by me," said Aurelia: "you are looking at the happy child with admiration,
in truth, I took it into my arms with joy; I keep it carefully: yet by it too I can measure the extent of my sufferings;
for they seldom let me feel the worth of such a gift.
"Allow me," she continued, "to speak to you about myself and my destiny: for I have it much at heart that you
should not misunderstand me. I thought I should have a few calm instants, and accordingly I sent for you; you are
now here, and the thread of my narrative is lost.
"One more forsaken woman in the world!' you will say. You are a man; you are a man; you are thinking: 'What a
noise she makes, the fool, about a necessary evil; which, certainly as death, awaits a woman, when such is the
fidelity of men!' O my friend! if my fate were common, I would gladly undergo a common evil; but it is so
singular: why cannot I present it to you in a mirror, why not command some one to tell it you? O, had I, had I
been seduced, surprised, and afterwards forsaken, there would then still be comfort in despair: but I am far more
miserable; I have been my own deceiver; I have wittingly betrayed myself; and this, this is what shall never be
forgiven me."
"With noble feelings, such as yours," said Wilhelm, "you can never be entirely unhappy."
"And do you know to what I am indebted for my feelings?" asked Aurelia. "To the worst education that ever
threatened to contaminate a girl; to the vilest examples for misleading the senses and the inclinations.
"My mother dying early, the fairest years of my youth were spent with an aunt, whose principle it was to despise
the laws of decency. She resigned herself headlong to every impulse; careless whether the object of it proved her
tyrant or her slave, so she might forget herself in wild enjoyment.
"By children, with the pure clear vision of innocence, what ideas of men were necessarily formed in such a scene!
How stolid, brutally bold, importunate, unmannerly, was every one whom she allured! How sated, empty, insolent
and tasteless, when he left her! I have seen this woman live, for years, humbled under the control of the meanest
creatures. What incidents she had to undergo! With what a front she contrived to accommodate herself to her
destiny; nay, with how much skill to wear those shameful fetters!

Chapter XV

"It was thus, my friend, that I became acquainted with your sex: and deeply did I hate it, when, as I imagined, I
observed that even tolerable men, in their conduct to ours, appeared to renounce every honest feeling, of which
Nature might otherwise have made them capable.
"Unhappily, moreover, on such occasions, a multitude of painful discoveries about my own sex were forced upon
me: and in truth I was then wiser, as a girl of sixteen, than I now am; now that I scarcely understand myself. Why
are we so wise when young; so wise, and ever growing less so?"
The boy began to make a noise; Aurelia became impatient, and rung. An old woman came to take him out. "Hast
thou tooth−ache still?" said Aurelia to the crone, whose face was wrapped in cloth. "Unsufferable," said the other,
with a muffled voice; then lifted the boy, who seemed to like going with her, and carried him away.
Scarcely was he gone, when Aurelia began bitterly to weep. "I am good for nothing," cried she, "but lamenting
and complaining; and I feel ashamed to lie before you like a miserable worm. My recollection is already fled; I
can relate no more." She faltered, and was silent. Her friend, unwilling to reply with a commonplace, and unable
to reply with anything particularly applicable, pressed her hand, and looked at her for some time without
speaking. Thus embarrassed, he at length took up a book, which he noticed Iying on the table before him: it was
Shakspeare's works, and open at Hamlet.
Serlo at this moment entering, inquired about his sister; and looking in the book which our friend had hold of,
cried: "So you are again at Hamlet? Very good! Many doubts have arisen in me, which seem not a little to impair
the canonical aspect of the piece as you would have it viewed. The English themselves have admitted that its chief
interest concludes with the third act; the last two lagging sorrily on, and scarcely uniting with the rest: and
certainly about the end it seems to stand stock−still."
"It is very possible," said Wilhelm, "that some individuals of a nation, which has so many master−pieces to feel
proud of, may be led by prejudice and narrowness of mind to form false judgments: but this cannot hinder us from
looking with our own eyes, and doing justice where we see it due. I am very far from censuring the plan of
Hamlet; on the contrary, I believe there never was a grander one invented; nay, it is not invented, it is real."
"How do you demonstrate that?" inquired Serlo.
"I will not demonstrate anything," said Wilhelm; "I will merely show you what my own conceptions of it are."
Aurelia rose up from her cushion; leaned upon her hand, and looked at Wilhelm; who, with the firmest assurance
that he was in the right, went on as follows: "It pleases us, it flatters us to see a hero acting on his own strength;
loving and hating as his heart directs him; undertaking and completing; casting every obstacle aside; and at length
attaining some great object which he aimed at. Poets and historians would willingly persuade us that so proud a
lot may fall to man. In Hamlet we are taught another lesson: the hero is without a plan, but the piece is full of
plan. Here we have no villain punished on some self−conceived and rigidly−accomplished scheme of vengeance:
a horrid deed occurs; it rolls itself along with all its consequences, dragging guiltless persons also in its course;
the perpetrator seems as if he would evade the abyss which is made ready for him; yet he plunges in, at the very
point by which he thinks he shall escape and happily complete his course.
"For it is the property of crime to extend its mischief over innocence, as it is of virtue to extend its blessings over
many that deserve them not; while frequently the author of the one or of the other is not punished or rewarded at
all. Here is this play of ours, how strange! The Pit of darkness sends its spirit and demands revenge; in vain! All
circumstances tend one way, and hurry to revenge; in vain! Neither earthly nor infernal thing may bring about
what is reserved for Fate alone. The hour of judgment comes: the wicked falls with the good: one race is mowed
away, that another may spring up."

Chapter XV

After a pause, in which they looked at one another, Serlo said: "You pay no great compliment to Providence, in
thus exalting Shakspeare; and besides, it appears to me, that for the honour of your poet, as others for the honour
of Providence, you ascribe to him an object and a plan, which he himself had never thought of."

Chapter XVI
"LET me also put a question," said Aurelia. "I have looked at Ophelia's part again; I am contented with it, and
conceive that under certain circumstances I could play it. But tell me, should not the poet have furnished the
insane maiden with another sort of songs? Could not one select some fragments out of melancholy ballads for this
purpose? What have double meanings and lascivious insipidities to do in the mouth of such a noble−minded
person?"
"Dear friend," said Wilhelm, "even here I cannot yield you one iota. In these singularities, in this apparent
impropriety, a deep sense is hid. Do we not understand from the very first what the mind of the good soft−hearted
girl was busied with? Silently she lived within herself, yet she scarce concealed her wishes, her longing; the tones
of desire were in secret ringing through her soul; and how often may she have attempted, like an unskilful nurse,
to lull her senses to repose with songs which only kept them more awake? But at last, when her self−command is
altogether gone, when the secrets of her heart are hovering on her tongue, that tongue betrays her, and in the
innocence of insanity she solaces herself, unmindful of king or queen, with the echo of her loose and
well−beloved songs: Tomorrow is Saint Valentine's day; and By Gis and by Saint Charity."
He had not finished speaking, when all at once an extraordinary scene took place before him, which he could not
in any way explain.
Serlo had walked once or twice up and down the room without evincing any special object. On a sudden, he
stepped forward to Aurelia's dressing−table; caught hastily at something that was lying there, and hastened to the
door with his booty. No sooner did Aurelia notice this, than springing up, she threw herself in his way; laid hold
of him with boundless vehemence, and had dexterity enough to clutch an end of the article which he was carrying
off. They struggled and wrestled with great obstinacy; twisted and threw each other sharply round: he laughed;
she exerted all her strength: and as Wilhelm hastened towards them, to separate and soothe them, Aurelia sprang
aside with a naked dagger in her hand, while Serlo cast the scabbard, which had stayed with him, angrily upon the
floor. Wilhelm started back astonished; and his dumb wonder seemed to ask the cause why so violent a strife,
about so strange an implement, had taken place between them.
"You shall judge betwixt us," said the brother. "What has she to do with sharp steel? Do but look at it. That
dagger is not fit for any actress: point like a needle's, edge like a razor's! What good is it? Passionate as she is, she
will one day chance to do herself a mischief. I have a heart's hatred at such singularities: a serious thought of that
sort is insane, and so dangerous a plaything is not in taste."
"I have it back!" exclaimed Aurelia, and held the polished blade aloft; "I will now keep my faithful friend more
carefully. Pardon me," she cried, and kissed the steel, "that I have so neglected thee."
Serlo was like to grow seriously angry. "Take it as thou wilt, brother," she continued: "how knowest thou but,
under this form, a precious talisman may have been given me; so that, in extreme need, I may find help and
counsel in it? Must all be hurtful that looks dangerous?"
"Such talk without a meaning might drive one mad," said Serlo, and left the room with suppressed indignation.
Aurelia put the dagger carefully into its sheath, and placed it in her bosom. "Let us now resume the conversations
which our foolish brother has disturbed," said she, as Wilhelm was beginning to put questions on the subject of
this quarrel.
Chapter XVI

"I must admit your picture of Ophelia to be just," continued she; "I cannot now misunderstand the object of the
poet: I must pity, though, as you paint her, I shall rather pity her than sympathise with her. But allow me here to
offer a remark, which in these few days you have frequently suggested to me. I observe with admiration the
correct, keen, penetrating glance with which you judge of poetry, especially dramatic poetry: the deepest abysses
of invention are not hidden from you, the finest touches of representation cannot escape you. Without ever having
viewed the objects in nature, you recognise the truth of their images: there seems, as it were, a presentiment of all
the universe to lie in you, which by the harmonious touch of poetry is awakened and unfolded. For in truth,"
continued she, "from without, you receive not much: I have scarcely seen a person that so little knew, so totally
misknew the people he lived with, as you do. Allow me to say it: in hearing you expound the mysteries of
Shakspeare, one would think you had just descended from a synod of the gods, and had listened there while they
were taking counsel how to form men; in seeing you transact with your fellows, I could imagine you to be the first
large−born child of the Creation, standing agape, and gazing with strange wonderment and edifying good−nature,
at lions and apes and sheep and elephants, and true−heartedly addressing them as your equals, simply because
they were there, and in motion like yourself."
"The feeling of my ignorance in this respect," said Wilhelm, "often gives me pain; and I should thank you, worthy
friend, if you would help me to get a little better insight into life. From youth, I have been accustomed to direct
the eyes of my spirit inwards rather than outwards; and hence it is very natural that to a certain extent I should be
acquainted with man, while of men I have not the smallest knowledge."
"In truth," said Aurelia, "I at first suspected that, in giving such accounts of the people whom you sent to my
brother, you meant to make sport of us; when I compared your letters with the merits of these persons, it seemed
very strange."
Aurelia's remarks, well−founded as they might be, and willing as our friend was to confess himself deficient in
this matter, carried with them something painful, nay offensive to him: so that he grew silent, and retired within
himself, partly to avoid showing any irritated feeling, partly to search his mind for the truth or error of the charge.
"Let not this alarm you," said Aurelia: "the light of the understanding it is always in our power to reach; but this
fulness of the heart no one can give us. If you are destined for an artist, you cannot long enough retain the
dim−sightedness and innocence of which I speak; it is the beautiful hull upon the young bud; woe to us if we are
forced too soon to burst it! Surely it were well, if we never knew what the people are, for whom we work and
study.
"Oh! I too was in that happy case, when I first betrod the stage, with the loftiest opinion of myself and of my
nation. What a people, in my fancy, were the Germans; what a people might they yet become! I addressed this
people; raised above them by a little joinery, separated from them by a row of lamps, whose glancing and vapour
threw an indistinctness over everything before me. How welcome was the tumult of applause, which sounded to
me from the crowd; how gratefully did I accept the present, offered me unanimously by so many hands! For a
time I rocked myself in these ideas; I affected the multitude, and was again affected by them. With my public I
was on the fairest footing; I imagined that I felt a perfect harmony betwixt us, and that on each occasion I beheld
before me the best and noblest of the land.
"Unhappily it was not the actress alone that inspired these friends of the stage with interest; they likewise made
pretensions to the young and lively girl. They gave me to understand, in terms distinct enough, that my duty was
not only to excite emotion in them, but to share it with them personally. This unluckily was not my business: I
wished to elevate their minds; but to what they called their hearts I had not the slightest claim. Yet now men of all
ranks, ages and characters, by turns afflicted me with their addresses; and it did seem hard that I could not, like an
honest young woman, shut my door, and spare myself such a quantity of labour.

Chapter XVI

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
"The men appeared, for most part, much the same as I had been accustomed to about my aunt; and here again I
should have felt disgusted with them, had not their peculiarities and insipidities amused me. As I was compelled
to see them, in the theatre, in open places, in my house, I formed the project of spying out their follies, and my
brother helped me with alacrity to execute it. And if you reflect that, up from the whisking shopman and the
conceited merchant's son, to the polished calculating man of the world, the bold soldier and the impetuous prince,
all in succession passed in review before me, each in his way endeavouring to found his small romance, you will
pardon me if I conceived that I had gained some acquaintance with my nation.
"The fantastically−dizened student; the awkward, humbly−proud man of letters; the sleek−fed, gouty canon; the
solemn, heedful man of office; the heavy country−baron; the smirking, vapid courtier; the young erring parson;
the cool, as well as the quick and sharply−speculating merchant: all these I have seen in motion; and I swear to
you that there were few among them fitted to inspire me even with a sentiment of toleration: on the contrary, I felt
it altogether irksome to collect, with tedium and annoyance, the suffrages of fools; to pocket those applauses in
detail, which in their accumulated state had so delighted me, which in the gross I had appropriated with such
pleasure.
"If I expected a rational compliment upon my acting; if I hoped that they would praise an author whom I valued,
they were sure to make one empty observation on the back of another, and to name some tasteless piece in which
they wished to see me play. If I listened in their company, to hear if some noble, brilliant, witty thought had met
with a response among them, and would reappear from some of them in proper season, it was rare that I could
catch an echo of it. An error that had happened, a mispronunciation, a provincialism of some actor; such were the
weighty points by which they held fast, beyond which they could not pass. I knew not, in the end, to what hand I
should turn: themselves they thought too clever to be entertained; and me they imagined they were well
entertaining, if they romped and made noise enough about me. I began very cordially to despise them all; I felt as
if the whole nation had, on purpose, deputed these people to debase it in my eyes. They appeared to me so
clownish, so ill−bred, so wretchedly instructed, so void of pleasing qualities, so wretchedly instructed, so void of
pleasing qualities, so tasteless; I frequently exclaimed: No German can buckle his shoes, till he has learned to do
it of some foreign nation!
"You perceive how blind, how unjust and splenetic I was; and the longer it lasted, my spleen increased. I might
have killed myself with these things: but I fell into the contrary extreme; I married, or rather let myself be
married. My brother, who had undertaken to conduct the theatre, wished much to have a helper. His choice
lighted on a young man, who was not offensive to me; who wanted all that my brother had, genius, victory, spirit
and impetuosity of mind; but who also in return had all that my brother wanted, love of order, diligence, and
precious gifts in housekeeping and the management of money.
"He became my husband, I know not how; we lived together, I do not well know why. Enough, our affairs went
prosperously forward. We drew a large income; of this my brother's activity was the cause. We lived with a
moderate expenditure; and that was the merit of my husband. I thought no more about world or nation. With the
world I had nothing to participate: my idea of the nation had faded away. When I entered on the scene, I did so
that I might subsist; I opened my lips because I durst not continue silent, because I had come out to speak.
"Yet let me do the matter justice. I had altogether given myself up to the disposal of my brother. His objects were
applause and money; for, between ourselves, he has no dislike to hear his own praises, and his outlay is always
great. I no longer played according to my own feeling, to my own conviction; but as he directed me: and if I did it
to his satisfaction, I was content. He steered entirely by the caprices of the public. Money flowed upon us; he
could live according to his humour, and so we had good times with him.
"Thus had I fallen into a dull, handicraft routine. I spun out my days without joy or sympathy. My marriage was
childless, and not of long continuance. My husband grew sick; his strength was visibly decaying; anxiety for him
interrupted my general indifference. It was at this time that I formed an acquaintance, which opened a new life for
Chapter XVI

me; a new and quicker one, for it will soon be done."
She kept silence for a time, and then continued: "All at once my prattling humour falters; I have not the courage to
go on. Let me rest a little. You shall not go, till you have learned the whole extent of my misfortune. Meanwhile,
call in Mignon, and ask her what she wants."
The child had more than once been in the room, while Aurelia and our friend were talking. As they spoke lower
on her entrance, she had glided out again, and was now sitting quietly in the hall, and waiting. Being bid return,
she brought a book with her, which its form and binding showed to be a small geographical atlas. She had seen
some maps, for the first time at the parson's house, with great astonishment; had asked him many questions, and
informed herself so far as possible about them. Her desire to learn seemed much excited by this new branch of
knowledge. She now earnestly requested Wilhelm to purchase her the book; saying she had pawned her large
silver buckle with the printseller for it, and wished to have back the pledge tomorrow morning, as this evening it
was late. Her request was granted; and she then began repeating several things she had already learned; at the
same time, in her own way, making many very strange inquiries. Here again one might observe, that, with a
mighty effort, she could comprehend but little and laboriously. So likewise was it with her writing, at which she
still kept busied. She yet spoke very broken German: it was only when she opened her mouth to sing, when she
touched her cithern, that she seemed to be employing an organ by which, in some degree, the workings of her
mind could be disclosed and communicated.
Since we are at present on the subject, we may also mention the perplexity which Wilhelm had of late
experienced from certain parts of her procedure. When she came or went, wished him good−morning or
good−night, she clasped him so firmly in her arms, and kissed him with such ardour, that often the violence of this
expanding nature gave him serious fears. The spasmodic vivacity of her demeanour seemed daily to increase; her
whole being moved in a restless stillness. She would never be without some piece of packthread to twist in her
hands; some napkin to tie in knots; some paper or wood to chew. All her sports seemed but the channels which
drained off some inward violent commotion.
The only thing that seemed to cause her any cheerfulness was being near the boy Felix, with whom she could go
on in a very dainty manner.
Aurelia, after a little rest, being now ready to explain to her friend a matter which lay very near her heart, grew
impatient at the little girl's delay, and signified that she must go; a hint, however, which the latter did not take; and
at last, when nothing else would do, they sent her off expressly and against her will.
"Now or never," said Aurelia, "must I tell you the remainder of my story. Were my tenderly−beloved and unjust
friend but a few miles distant, I would say to you: 'Mount on horseback, seek by some means to get acquainted
with him; on returning you will certainly forgive me, and pity me with all your heart.' As it is, I can only tell you
with words how amiable he was, and how much I loved him.
"It was at the critical season, when care for the illness of my husband had depressed my spirits, that I first became
acquainted with this stranger. He had just returned from America, where, in company with some Frenchmen, he
had served with much distinction under the colours of the United States.
"He addressed me with an easy dignity, a frank kindliness; he spoke about myself, my state, my acting, like an old
acquaintance, so affectionately and distinctly, that now for the first time I enjoyed the pleasure of perceiving my
existence reflected in the being of another. His judgments were just, though not severe; penetrating, yet not void
of love. He showed no harshness; his pleasantry was courteous, with all his humour. He seemed accustomed to
success with women; this excited my attention: he was never in the least importunate or flattering; this put me off
my guard.

Chapter XVI

"In the town he had intercourse with few; he was often on horseback, visiting his many friends in the
neighbourhood, and managing the business of his house. On returning, he would frequently alight at my
apartments; he treated my ever−ailing husband with warm attention; he procured him mitigation of his sickness
by a good physician. And taking part in all that interested me, he allowed me to take part in all that interested him.
He told me the history of his campaigns; he spoke of his invincible attachment to military life, of his family
relations, of his present business. He kept no secret from me; he displayed to me his inmost thoughts, allowed me
to behold the most secret corners of his soul: I became acquainted with his passions and his capabilities. It was the
first time in my life that I enjoyed a cordial, intellectual intercourse with any living creature. I was attracted by
him, borne along by him, before I thought about inquiring how it stood with me.
"Meanwhile I lost my husband, nearly just as I had taken him. The burden of theatrical affairs now fell entirely on
me. My brother, not to be surpassed upon the stage, was never good for anything in economical concerns: I took
the charge of all; at the same time, studying my parts with greater diligence than ever. I again played as of old;
nay with new life, with quite another force. It was by reason of my friend, it was on his account that I did so; yet
my success was not always best when I knew him to be present. Once or twice he listened to me unobserved; and
how pleasantly his unexpected applauses surprised me you may conceive.
"Certainly I am a strange creature. In every part I played, it seemed as if I had been speaking it in praise of him;
for that was the temper of my heart, the words might be anything they pleased. Did I understand him to be present
in the audience, I durst not venture to speak out with all my force; just as I would not press my love or praise on
him to his face: was he absent, I had then free scope; I did my best, with a certain peacefulness, with a
contentment not to be described. Applause once more delighted me; and when I charmed the people, I longed to
call down among them: 'This you owe to him!'
"Yes, my relation to the public; to the nation, had been altered by a wonder. On a sudden they again appeared to
me in the most favourable light; I felt astonished at my former blindness.
"How foolish, said I often to myself, was it to revile a nation; foolish simply since it was a nation. Is it necessary,
is it possible, that individual men should generally interest us much? Not at all! The only question is, whether in
the great mass there exists a sufficient quantity of talent, force and capability, which lucky circumstances may
develop, which men of lofty minds may direct upon a common object. I now rejoiced in discovering so little
prominent originality among my countrymen; I rejoiced that they disdained not to accept of guidance from
without; I rejoiced that they had found a leader.
"Lothario−allow me to designate my friend by this his first name which I loved−Lothario had always presented
the Germans to my mind on the side of valour; and shown me, that when well commanded, there was no braver
nation on the face of the earth; and I felt ashamed that I had never thought this the first quality of a people.
History was known to him; he was in connexion and correspondence with the most distinguished persons of the
age. Young as he was, his eye was open to the budding youthhood of his native country; to the silent labours of
active and busy men in so many provinces of art. He afforded me a glimpse of Germany; what it was, and what it
might be; and I blushed at having formed my judgment of a nation from the motley crowd, that press themselves
into the wardrobe of a theatre. He made me look upon it as a duty that I too, in my own department, should be
true, spirited, enlivening. I now felt as if inspired, every time I stepped upon the boards. Mediocre passages grew
golden in my mouth; had any poet been at hand to support me adequately, I might have produced the most
astonishing effects.
"So lived the young widow for a series of months. He could not want me; and I felt exceedingly unhappy when he
stayed away. He showed me the letters he received from his relations, from his amiable sister. He took an interest
in the smallest circumstances that concerned me; more complete, more intimate no union ever was than ours. The
name of love was not mentioned. He went and came, came and went−And now, my friend, it is high time that you
too should go."

WILHELM could put off no longer the visiting of his commercial friends. He proceeded to their place with some
anxiety; knowing he should there find letters from his people. He dreaded the reproofs which these would of
course contain: it seemed likely also that notice had been given to his trading correspondents, concerning the
perplexities and fears which his late silence had occasioned. After such a series of knightly adventures, he
recoiled from the school−boy aspect in which he must appear: he proposed within his mind to act with an air of
sternness and defiance, and thus hide his embarrassment.
To his great wonder and contentment, however, all went off very easily and well. In the vast, stirring, busy
countingroom, the men had scarcely time to seek him out his packet; his delay was but alluded to in passing. And
on opening the letters of his father and his friend Werner, he found them all of very innocent contents. His father,
in hopes of an extensive journal, the keeping of which he had strongly recommended to his son at parting, giving
him also a tabulary scheme for that purpose, seemed pretty well pacified about the silence of the first period;
complaining only of a certain enigmatical obscurity in the last and only letter, dispatched, as we have seen, from
the Castle of the Count. Werner joked in his way; told merry anecdotes, facetious burgh news; and requested
intelligence of friends and acquaintances, whom Wilhelm in the large trading city would now meet with in great
numbers. Our friend, extremely pleased at getting off so well, answered without loss of a moment, in some very
cheerful letters: promising his father a copious journal of his travels, with all the required geographical, statistical
and mercantile remarks. He had seen much on his journey, he said; and hoped to make a tolerably large
manuscript out of these materials. He did not observe, that he was almost in the same case as he had once
experienced before, when he assembled an audience and lit his lamps to represent a play, which was not written,
still less got by heart. Accordingly, so soon as he commenced the actual work of composition, he became aware
that he had much to say about emotions and thoughts, and many experiences of the heart and spirit; but not a word
concerning outward objects, on which, as he now discovered, he had not bestowed the least attention.
In this embarrassment, the acquisitions of his friend Laertes came very seasonably to his aid. Custom had united
these young people, unlike one another as they were; and Laertes, with all his failings and singularities, was
actually an interesting man. Endowed with warm and pleasurable senses, he might have reached old age without
reflecting for a moment on his situation. But his ill fortune and his sickness had robbed him of the pure feelings of
youth; and opened for him instead of it a view into the transitoriness, the discontinuity of man's existence. Hence
had arisen a humorous, flighty, rhapsodical way of thinking about all things, or rather of uttering the immediate
impressions they produced on him. He did not like to be alone; he strolled about all the coffee−houses and
tables−d'hôte: and when he did stay at home, books of travels were his favourite, nay his only kind of reading.
Having lately found a large circulating library, he had been enabled to content his taste in this respect to the full;
and ere long half the world was figuring in his faithful memory.
It was easy for him, therefore, to speak comfort to his friend, when the latter had disclosed his utter lack of matter
for the narrative so solemnly promised by him. "Now is the time for a stroke of art," said Laertes, "that shall have
no fellow!
"Has not Germany been travelled over, cruised over, walked, crept and flown over, repeatedly from end to end?
And has not every German traveller the royal privilege of drawing from the public a repayment of the great or
small expenses he may have incurred while travelling? Give me your route previous to our meeting; the rest I
know already. I will find you helps and sources of information: of miles that were never measured, populations
that were never counted, we shall give them plenty. The revenues of provinces we will take from almanacs and
tables, which, as all men know, are the most authentic documents. On these we will ground our political
discussions; we shall not fail in side−glances at the ruling powers. One or two princes we will paint as true fathers
of their country, that we may gain more ready credence in our allegations against others. If we do not travel
through the residence of any noted man, we shall take care to meet such persons at the inn, and make them utter

the most foolish stuff to us. Particularly, let us not forget to insert, with all its graces and sentiments, some
love−story with a pastoral barmaid. I tell you it shall be a composition, which will not only fill father and mother
with delight, but which booksellers themselves shall gladly pay you current money for."
They went accordingly to work; and both of them found pleasure in their labour. Wilhelm, in the mean time
frequenting the play at night, and conversing with Serlo and Aurelia by day, experienced the greatest satisfaction;
and was daily more and more expanding his ideas, which had been too long revolving in the same narrow circle.

Chapter XVIII
IT was not without deep interest that he became acquainted with the history of Serlo's career. Piecemeal he
learned it; for it was not the fashion of that extraordinary man to be confidential, or to speak of anything
connectively. He had been, one may say, born and suckled in the theatre. While yet literally an infant, he had been
produced upon the stage to move spectators merely by his presence; for authors even then were acquainted with
this natural and very guiltless mode of doing so. Thus his first "Father!" or "Mother!" in favourite pieces,
procured him approbation, before he understood what was meant by that clapping of the hands. In the character of
Cupid he more than once descended, with terror, in his flying−gear; as harlequin he used to issue from the egg;
and as a little chimneysweep to play the sharpest tricks.
Unhappily, the plaudits of these glancing nights were too bitterly repaid by sufferings in the intervening seasons.
His father was persuaded that the minds of children could be kept awake and steadfast by no other means than
blows; hence, in the studying of any part, he used to thrash him at stated periods; not because the boy was
awkward, but that he might become more certainly and constantly expert. It was thus that in former times, while
putting down a landmark, people were accustomed to bestow a hearty drubbing on the children who had followed
them; and these, it was supposed, would recollect the place exactly to the latest day of their lives. Serlo waxed in
stature, and showed the finest capabilities of spirit and of body; in particular an admirable pliancy at once in his
thoughts, looks, movements and gestures. His gift of imitation was beyond belief. When still a boy he could
mimic persons, so that you would think you saw them; though in form, age and disposition, they might be entirely
unlike him, and unlike each other. Nor, with all this, did he want the knack of suiting himself to his
circumstances, and picking out his way in life. Accordingly, so soon as he had grown in some degree acquainted
with his strength, he very naturally eloped from his father; who, as the boy's understanding and dexterity
increased, still thought it needful to forward their perfection by the harshest treatment.
Happy was the wild boy, now roaming free about the world, where his feats of waggery never failed to secure him
a good reception. His lucky star first led him in the Christmas season to a cloister, where the friar, whose business
it had been to arrange processions, and to entertain the Christian community by spiritual masquerades, having just
died, Serlo was welcomed as a helping angel. On the instant he took up the part of Gabriel in the Annunciation;
and did not by any means displease the pretty girl, who, acting the Virgin, very gracefully received his most
obliging kiss, with external humility and inward pride. In their Mysteries he continued to perform the most
important parts; and thought himself no slender personage, when at last, in the character of Martyr, he was
mocked of the world, and beaten, and fixed upon the cross.
Some Pagan soldiers had, on this occasion, played their parts a little too naturally. To be avenged on these
heathen in the proper style, he took care at the Day of Judgment to have them decked out in gaudy clothes as
emperors and kings; and at the moment when they, exceedingly contented with their situation, were about to take
precedence of the rest in heaven as they had done on earth, he on a sudden rushed upon them in the shape of the
Devil; and, to the cordial edification of all the beggars and spectators, having thoroughly curried them with his
oven−fork, he pushed them without mercy back into the Chasm, where, in the midst of waving flame, they met
with the sorriest welcome.

Chapter XVIII

He was acute enough, however, to perceive that these crowned heads might feel offended at such bold procedure;
and perhaps forget the reverence due to his privileged office of Accuser and Turnkey. So in all silence, before the
Millennium commenced, he withdrew, and betook him to a neighbouring town. Here a society of persons,
denominated Children of Joy, received him with open arms. They were a set of clever, strong−headed, lively
geniuses, who saw well enough that the sum of our existence, divided by reason, never gives an integer number,
but that a surprising fraction is always left behind. At stated times, to get rid of this fraction, which impedes, and
if it is diffused over all the mass of our conduct, endangers us, was the object of the Children of Joy. For one day
a−week each of them in succession was a fool on purpose; and during this, he in his turn exhibited to ridicule, in
allegorical representations, whatever folly he had noticed in himself or the rest, throughout the other six. This
practice might be somewhat ruder than that constant training, in the course of which a man of ordinary morals is
accustomed to observe, to warn, to punish himself daily; but it was also merrier and surer. For as no Child of Joy
concealed his bosom−folly, so he and those about him held it for simply what it was: whereas, on the other plan,
by the help of self−deception, this same bosom−folly often gains the head authority within, and binds down
reason to a secret servitude, at the very time when reason fondly hopes that she has long since chased it out of
doors. The mask of folly circulated round in this society; and each member was allowed, in his particular day, to
decorate and characterise it with his own attributes or those of others. At the time of Carnival, they assumed the
greatest freedom, vying with the clergy in attempts to instruct and entertain the multitude. Their solemn figurative
processions of Virtues and Vices, Arts and Sciences, Quarters of the World, and Seasons of the Year, bodied forth
a number of conceptions, and gave images of many distant objects to the people, and hence were not without their
use; while, on the other hand, the mummeries of the priesthood tended but to strengthen a tasteless superstition,
already strong enough.
Here again young Serlo was altogether in his element. Invention in its strictest sense, it is true, he had not; but, on
the other hand, he had the most consummate skill in employing what he found before him; in ordering it; and
shadowing it forth. His roguish turns; his gift of mimicry; his biting wit, which at least one day weekly he might
use with entire freedom, even against his benefactors, made him precious, or rather indispensable, to the whole
society.
Yet his restless mind soon drove him from this favourable scene to other quarters of his country, where other
means of instruction awaited him. He came into the polished but also barren part of Germany, where, in
worshipping the good and the beautiful, there is indeed no want of truth, but frequently a grievous want of spirit.
His masks would here do nothing for him: he had now to aim at working on the heart and mind. For short periods
he attached himself to small or to extensive companies of actors; and marked, on these occasions, what were the
distinctive properties both of the pieces and the players. The monotony which then reigned on the German theatre,
the mawkish sound and cadence of their Alexandrines, the flat and yet distorted dialogue, the shallowness and
commonness of these undisguised preachers of morality, he was not long in comprehending; or in seizing, at the
same time, what little there was that moved and pleased.
Not only single parts in the current pieces, but the pieces themselves remained easily and wholly in his memory;
and along with them, the special tone of any player who had represented them with approbation. At length, in the
course of his rambles, his money being altogether done, the project struck him of acting entire pieces by himself,
especially in villages, and noblemen's houses; and thus in all places making sure at least of entertainment and
lodging. In any tavern, any room, or any garden, he would accordingly at once set up his theatre: with a roguish
seriousness and a show of enthusiasm, he would contrive to gain the imaginations of his audience; to deceive their
senses, and before their eyes to make an old press into a tower, or a fan into a dagger. His youthful warmth
supplied the place of deep feeling; his vehemence seemed strength, and his flattery tenderness. Such of the
spectators as already knew a theatre, he put in mind of all that they had seen and heard; in the rest he awakened a
presentiment of something wonderful, and a wish to be more acquainted with it. What produced an effect in one
place he did not fail to repeat in others; and his mind overflowed with a wicked pleasure when, by the same
means, on the spur of the moment, he could make gulls of all the world.

Chapter XVIII

133

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
His spirit was lively, brisk and unimpeded: by frequently repeating parts and pieces, he improved very fast. Ere
long he could recite and play with more conformity to the sense, than the models whom he had at first imitated.
Proceeding thus, he arrived by degrees at playing naturally, though he did not cease to feign. He seemed
transported, yet he lay in wait for the effect; and his greatest pride was in moving, by successive touches, the
passions of men. The mad trade he drove did itself soon force him to proceed with a certain moderation; and thus,
partly by constraint, partly by instinct, he learned the art of which so few players seem to have a notion, the art of
being frugal in the use of voice and gestures.
Thus did he contrive to tame, and to inspire with interest for him, even rude and unfriendly men. Being always
contented with food and shelter; thankfully accepting presents of any kind as readily as money; which latter, when
he reckoned that he had enough of it, he frequently declined,−he became a general favourite; was sent about from
one to another with recommendatory letters; and thus he wandered many a day from castle to castle, exciting
much festivity, enjoying much, and meeting in his travels with the most agreeable and curious adventures.
With such inward coldness of temper, he could not properly be said to love any one; with such clearness of vision,
he could respect no one. In fact, he never looked beyond the external peculiarities of men; and he merely carried
their characters in his mimical collection. Yet withal his selfishness was keenly wounded, if he did not please
every one, and call forth universal applause. How this might be attained, he had studied in the course of time so
accurately, and so sharpened his sense of the matter, that not only on the stage, but also in common life, he no
longer could do otherwise than flatter and deceive. And thus did his disposition, his talent and his way of life,
work reciprocally on each other, till by this means he had imperceptibly been formed into a perfect actor. Nay, by
a mode of action and reaction, which is quite natural, though it seems paradoxical, his recitation, declamation and
gesture, improved, by critical discernment and practice, to a high degree of truth, ease and frankness; while, in his
life and intercourse with men, he seemed to grow continually more secret, artful, or even hypocritical and
constrained.
Of his fortunes and adventures we perhaps shall speak in another place: it is enough to remark at present, that in
later times, when he had become a man of circumstance, in possession of a distinct reputation, and of a very good
though not entirely secure employment and rank, he was wont, in conversation, partly in the way of irony, partly
of mockery, in a delicate style, to act the sophist, and thus to destroy almost all serious discussion. This kind of
speech he seemed peculiarly fond of using towards Wilhelm, particularly when the latter took a fancy, as often
happened, for introducing any of his general and theoretical disquisitions. Yet still they liked well to be together;
with such different modes of thinking, the conversation could not fail to be lively. Wilhelm always wished to
deduce everything from abstract ideas which he had arrived at; he wanted to have art viewed in all its connexions
as a whole. He wanted to promulgate and fix down universal laws; to settle what was right, beautiful and good: in
short, he treated all things in a serious manner. Serlo, on the other hand, took up the matter very lightly: never
answering directly to any question, he would contrive by some anecdote or laughable turn, to give the finest and
most satisfactory illustrations; and thus to instruct his audience while he made them merry.

Chapter XIX
WHILE our friend was in this way living very happily, Melina and the rest were in quite a different case. Wilhelm
they haunted like evil spirits; and not only by their presence, but frequently by rueful faces and bitter words, they
caused him many a sorry moment. Serlo had not admitted them to the most trifling part, far less held out to them
any hope of a permanent engagement; and yet he had contrived, by degrees, to get acquainted with the capabilities
of every one of them. Whenever any actors were assembled in leisure hours about him, he was wont to make them
read, and frequently to read along with them.
On such occasions, he took plays which were by and by to be acted, which for a long time had remained unacted;
and generally by portions. In like manner, after any first representation, he caused such passages to be repeated as
Chapter XIX

134

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
he had anything to say upon; by which means he sharpened the discernment of his actors, and strengthened their
certainty of hitting the proper point. And as a person of slender but correct understanding may produce more
agreeable effect on others, than a perplexed and unpurified genius, he would frequently exalt men of mediocre
talents, by the clear views which he imperceptibly afforded them, to a wonderful extent of power. Nor was it an
unimportant item in his scheme, that he likewise had poems read before him in their meetings; for by these he
nourished in his people the feeling of that charm which a well−pronounced rhythm is calculated to awaken in the
soul; whereas in other companies, those prose compositions were already getting introduced, for which any tyro
was adequate.
On occasions such as these, he had contrived to make himself acquainted with the new−come players: he had
decided what they were, and what they might be; and silently made up his mind to take advantage of their talents,
in a revolution which was now threatening his own company. For a while he let the matter rest; declined every
one of Wilhelm's intercessions for his comrades, with a shrug of the shoulders; till at last he saw his time, and
altogether unexpectedly made the proposal to our friend, "that he himself should come upon the stage; that on this
condition, the others too might be admitted."
"These people must not be so useless as you formerly described them," answered Wilhelm, "if they can now be all
received at once; and I suppose their talents would remain the same without me as with me."
Under seal of secrecy, Serlo hereupon explained his situation: how his first actor was giving hints about a rise of
salary at the renewal of their contract; how he himself did not incline conceding this, the rather as the individual
in question was no longer in such favour with the public; how, if he dismissed him, a whole train would follow;
whereby, it was true, his company would lose some good, but likewise some indifferent actors. He then showed
Wilhelm what he hoped to gain in him, in Laertes, Old Boisterous, and even Frau Melina. Nay, he promised to
procure for the silly Pedant himself, in the character of Jew, minister, but chiefly of villain, a decided approbation.
Wilhelm faltered; the proposal fluttered him; he knew not what to say. That he might say something, he rejoined
with a deep−drawn breath: "You speak very graciously about the good you find and hope to find in us: but how is
it with our weak points, which certainly have not escaped your penetration?"
"These," said Serlo, "by diligence, practice and reflection, we shall soon make strong points. Though you are yet
but freshmen and bunglers, there is not one among you that does not warrant expectation more or less: for, so far
as I can judge, no stick, properly so called, is to be met with in the company; and your stick is the only person that
can never be improved, never bent or guided, whether it be self−conceit, stupidity, or hypochondria, that renders
him unpliant."
The manager next stated, in a few words, the terms he meant to offer; requested Wilhelm to determine soon, and
left him in no small perplexity.
In the marvellous composition of those travels, which he had at first engaged with as it were in jest, and was now
carrying on in conjunction with Laertes, his mind had by degrees grown more attentive to the circumstances and
the every−day life of the actual world than it was wont. He now first understood the object of his father in so
earnestly recommending him to keep a journal. He now, for the first time, felt how pleasant and how useful it
might be to become participator in so many trades and requisitions, and to take a hand in diffusing activity and
life into the deepest nooks of the mountains and forests of Europe. The busy trading town in which he was; the
unrest of Laertes, who dragged him about to examine everything, afforded him the most impressive image of a
mighty centre, from which everything was flowing out, to which everything was coming back; and it was the first
time that his spirit, in contemplating this species of activity, had really felt delight. At such a juncture Serlo's offer
had been made him; had again awakened his desires, his tendencies, his faith in a natural talent, and again brought
into mind his solemn obligation to his helpless comrades.

Chapter XIX

"Here standest thou once more," said he within himself, "at the Parting of the Ways, between the two women who
appeared before thee in the youth. The one no longer looks so pitiful as then; nor does the other look so glorious.
To obey the one, or to obey the other, thou art not without a kind of inward calling; outward reasons are on both
sides strong enough; and to decide appears to thee impossible. Thou wishest some preponderancy from without
would fix thy choice: and yet, if thou consider well, it is external circumstances only that inspire thee with a wish
to trade, to gather, to possess; whilst it is thy inmost want that has created, that has nourished the desire still
farther to unfold and perfect what endowments soever for the beautiful and good, be they mental or bodily, may
lie within thee. And ought I not to honour Fate, which without furtherance of mine has led me hither to the goal of
all my wishes? Has not all that I in old times meditated and forecast, now happened accidentally, and without my
coöperation? Singular enough! We seem to be so intimate with nothing as we are with our own wishes and hopes,
which have long been kept and cherished in our hearts; yet when they meet us, when they as it were press forward
to us, then we know them not, then we recoil from them. All that, since the hapless night which severed me from
Mariana, I have but allowed myself to dream, now stands before me, entreating my acceptance. Hither I intended
to escape by flight; hither I am softly guided: with Serlo I meant to seek a place; he now seeks me, and offers me
conditions which, as a beginner, I could not have looked for. Was it then mere love to Mariana that bound me to
the stage? Or love to art that bound me to her? Was that prospect, that outlet, which the theatre presented me,
nothing but the project of a restless, disorderly and disobedient boy, wishing to lead a life which the customs of
the civic world would not admit of? Or, was all this different, worthier, purer? If so, what moved thee to alter the
persuasions of that period? Hast thou not hitherto, even without knowing it, pursued thy plan? Is not the
concluding step still farther to be justified, now that no side−purposes combine with it; now that in making it thou
mayest fulfil a solemn promise, and nobly free thyself from a heavy debt?"
All that could affect his heart and his imagination was now moving, and conflicting in the liveliest strife within
him. The thought that he might retain Mignon, that he should not need to put away the Harper, was not an
inconsiderable item in the balance; which, however, had not ceased to waver to the one and to the other side,
when he went, as he was wont, to see his friend Aurelia.

Chapter XX
SHE was lying on the sofa; she seemed quiet. "Do you think you will be fit to act tomorrow?" he inquired. "O
yes!" cried she with vivacity, "you know there is nothing to prevent me. If I but knew a way," continued she, "to
rid myself of those applauses! The people mean it well, but they will kill me. Last night, I thought my very heart
would break! Once, when I used to please myself, I could endure this gladly: when I had studied long, and well
prepared myself, it gave me joy to hear the sound, 'It has succeeded!' pealing back to me from every corner. But
now I speak not what I like, nor as I like; I am swept along, I get confused, I scarce know what I do; and the
impression I make is far deeper. The applause grows louder, and I think: Did you but know what charms you!
These dark, vague, vehement tones of passion move you, force you to admire; and you feel not that they are the
cries of agony, wrung from the miserable being whom you praise.
"I learned my part this morning; just now I have been repeating it and trying it. I am tired, broken down; and
tomorrow I must do the same. Tomorrow evening is the play. Thus do I drag myself to and fro: it is wearisome to
rise, it is wearisome to go to bed. All moves within me in an everlasting circle. Then come their dreary
consolations, and present themselves before me; and I cast them out, and execrate them. I will not surrender, not
surrender to necessity: why should that be necessary, which crushed me to the dust? Might it not be otherwise? I
am paying the penalty of being born a German; it is the nature of the Germans that they bear heavily on
everything, that everything bears heavily on them."
"O my friend!" cried Wilhelm, "could you cease to whet the dagger wherewith you are ever wounding me! Does
nothing then remain for you? Are your youth, your form, your health, your talents nothing? Having lost one
blessing, without blame of yours, must you throw all the others after it? Is that also necessary?"
Chapter XX

She was silent for a few moments, and then burst forth: "I know well it is a waste of time, nothing but a waste of
time, this love! What might not, should not I have done! And now it is all vanished into air. I am a poor,
wretched, lovelorn creature; lovelorn, that is all! O, have compassion on me: God knows I am poor and
wretched!"
She sank in thought; then, after a brief pause, she exclaimed with violence: "You are accustomed to have all
things fly into your arms. No, you cannot feel; no man is qualified to feel the worth of a woman that can
reverence herself. By all the holy angels, by all the images of blessedness, which a pure and kindly heart creates,
there is not anything more heavenly than the soul of a woman giving herself to the man she loves!
"We are cold, proud, high, clear−sighted, wise, while we deserve the name of women; and all these qualities we
lay down at your feet, the instant that we love, that we hope to excite a return of love. O, how have I cast away my
whole existence wittingly and willingly! But now will I despair, purposely despair. There is no drop of blood
within me but shall suffer, no fibre that I will not punish. Smile, I pray you; laugh at this theatrical display of
passion."
Wilhelm was far enough from any tendency to laugh. This horrible, half−natural, half−factitious condition of his
friend afflicted him but too deeply. He sympathised in the tortures of that racking misery: his thoughts were
wandering in painful perplexities, his blood was in a feverish tumult.
She had risen, and was walking up and down the room. "I see before me," she exclaimed, "all manner of reasons
why I should not love him. I know he is not worthy of it: I turn my mind aside, this way and that; I seize upon
whatever business I can find. At one time I take up a part, though I have not to play it; at another, I begin to
practise old ones, though I know them through and through; I practise them more diligently, more minutely, I toil
and toil at them−My friend, my confidant, what a horrid task is it to tear away one's thoughts from oneself! My
reason suffers, my brain is racked and strained: to save myself from madness I again admit the feeling that I love
him. Yes, I love him, I love him!" cried she, with a shower of tears; "I love him, I shall die loving him!"
He took her by the hand, and entreated her in the most earnest manner not to waste herself in such self−torments.
"O, it seems hard," said she, "that not only so much that is impossible should be denied us, but so much also that
is possible. It was not your lot to meet with a faithful heart that would have formed your perfect happiness. It was
mine to fix the welfare of my life upon a hapless creature, whom by the weight of my fidelity I drew to the bottom
like a reed, perhaps even broke in pieces!"
He had told Aurelia of his intercourse with Mariana, and could therefore now refer to it. She looked him intently
in the face, and asked: "Can you say that you never yet betrayed a woman, that you never tried with thoughtless
gallantry, with false asseverations, with cajoling oaths, to wheedle favour from her?"
"I can," said Wilhelm, "and indeed without much vanity: my life has been so simple and sequestered, I have had
but few enticements to attempt such things. And what a warning, my beautiful, my noble friend, is this
melancholy state in which I see you! Accept of me a vow, which is suited to my heart; which, under the emotion
you have caused me, has settled into words and shape, and will be hallowed by the hour in which I utter it: Each
transitory inclination I will study to withstand; and even the most earnest I will keep within my bosom; no woman
shall receive an acknowledgment of love from my lips, to whom I cannot consecrate my life!"
She looked at him with a wild indifference; and drew back some steps as he offered her his hand. "'Tis of no
moment!" cried she: "so many women's tears more or fewer; the ocean will not swell by reason of them. And yet,"
continued she, "among thousands one woman saved; that still is something: among thousands one honest man
discovered; this is not to be refused. Do you know then what you promise?"
"I know it," answered Wilhelm with a smile, and holding out his hand.

"I accept it then," said she, and made a movement with her right hand, as if meaning to take hold of his: but
instantly she darted it into her pocket, pulled out her dagger quick as lightning, and scored with the edge and point
of it across his hand. He hastily drew it back, but the blood was already running down.
"One must mark you men rather sharply, if one would have you take heed," cried she with a wild mirth, which
soon passed into a quick assiduity. She took her handkerchief, and bound his hand with it to stanch the
fast−flowing blood. "Forgive a half−crazed being," cried she, "and regret not these few drops of blood. I am
appeased, I am again myself. On my knees will I crave your pardon: leave me the comfort of healing you."
She ran to her drawer; brought lint, with other apparatus; stanched the blood, and viewed the wound attentively. It
went across the palm, close under the thumb, dividing the life−lines, and running towards the little finger. She
bound it up in silence, with a significant, reflective look. He asked once or twice: "Aurelia, how could you hurt
your friend?"
"Hush!" replied she, laying her finger on her mouth: "Hush!"

Book V
Chapter I
THUS Wilhelm, to his pair of former wounds, which were yet scarcely healed, had now got the accession of a
third, which was fresh and not a little disagreeable. Aurelia would not suffer him to call a surgeon; she dressed the
hand with all manner of strange speeches, saws and ceremonies; and so placed him in a very painful situation. Yet
not he alone, but all persons who came near her, suffered by her restlessness and singularity: and no one more
than little Felix. This stirring child was exceedingly impatient under such oppression, and showed himself still
naughtier, the more she censured and instructed him.
He delighted in some practices which commonly are thought bad habits, and in which she would not by any
means indulge him. He would drink, for example, rather from the bottle than the glass; and his food seemed
visibly to have a better relish when eaten from the bowl than from the plate. Such ill−breeding was not
overlooked: if he left the door standing open, or slammed it to; if when bid do anything, he stood stock−still, or
ran off violently, he was sure to have a long lecture inflicted on him for the fault. Yet he showed no symptoms of
improvement from this training: on the other hand, his affection for Aurelia seemed daily to diminish; there was
nothing tender in his tone when he called her Mother; whereas he passionately clung to the old nurse, who let him
have his will in everything.
But she likewise had of late become so sick, that they had at last been obliged to take her from the house into a
quiet lodging; and Felix would have been entirely alone, if Mignon had not, like a kindly guardian−spirit, come to
help him. The two children talked together, and amused each other in the prettiest style. She taught him little
songs; and he, having an excellent memory, frequently recited them, to the surprise of those about him. She
attempted also to explain her maps to him. With these she was still very busy, though she did not seem to take the
fittest method. For, in studying countries, she appeared to care little about any other point than whether they were
cold or warm. Of the north and south Poles, of the horrid ice which reigns there, and of the increasing heat the
farther one retires from them, she could give a very clear account. When any one was travelling, she merely asked
whether he was going northward or southward; and strove to find his route in her little charts. Especially when
Wilhelm spoke of travelling, she was all attention, and seemed vexed when anything occurred to change the
subject. Though she could not be prevailed upon to undertake a part, or even to enter the theatre when any play
was acting, yet she willingly and zealously committed many odes and songs to memory; and by unexpectedly, and
as it were an the spur of the moment, reciting some such poem, generally of the earnest and solemn kind, she
would often cause astonishment in every one.

Serlo, accustomed to regard with favour every trace of opening talent, encouraged her in such performances: but
what pleased him most in Mignon was her sprightly, various and often even mirthful singing. By means of a
similar gift, the Harper likewise had acquired his favour.
Without himself possessing genius for music, or playing on any instrument, Serlo could rightly prize the value of
the art; he failed not, as often as he could, to enjoy this pleasure, which cannot be compared with any other. He
held a concert once a−week; and now, with Mignon, the Harper and Laertes, who was not unskilful on the violin,
he had formed a very curious domestic band.
He was wont to say: "Men are so inclined to content themselves with what is commonest; the spirit and the senses
so easily grow dead to the impressions of the beautiful and perfect, that every one should study, by all methods, to
nourish in his mind the faculty of feeling these things. For no man can bear to be entirely deprived of such
enjoyments: it is only because they are not used to taste of what is excellent, that the generality of people take
delight in silly and insipid things, provided they be new. For this reason," he would add, "one ought every day at
least to hear a little song, read a good poem, see a fine picture, and, if it were possible, to speak a few reasonable
words." With such a turn of thought in Serlo, which in some degree was natural to him, the persons who
frequented his society could scarcely be in want of pleasant conversation.
It was in the midst of these instructive entertainments, that Wilhelm one day received a letter sealed in black.
Werner's hand betokened mournful news; and our friend was not a little shocked when, opening the sheet, he
found it to contain the tidings of his father's death, conveyed in a very few words. After a short and sudden illness
he had parted from the world leaving his domestic affairs in the best possible order.
This unlooked−for intelligence struck Wilhelm to the heart. He deeply felt how careless and negligent we often
are of friends and relations while they inhabit with us this terrestrial sojourn; and how we first repent of our
insensibility when the fair union, at least for this side of time, is finally cut asunder. His grief for the early death
of this honest parent was mitigated only by the feeling, that he had loved but little in the world, and the conviction
that he had enjoyed but little.
Wilhelm's thoughts soon turned to his own predicament; and he felt himself extremely discomposed. A person can
scarcely be put into a more dangerous position, than when external circumstances have produced some striking
change in his condition, without his manner of feeling and of thinking having undergone any preparation for it.
There is then an epoch without epoch; and the contradiction which arises is the greater, the less the person feels
that he is not trained for this new manner of existence.
Wilhelm saw himself in freedom, at a moment when he could not yet be at one with himself. His thoughts were
noble, his motives pure, his purposes were not to be despised. All this he could with some degree of confidence
acknowledge to himself: but he had of late been frequently enough compelled to notice, that experience was sadly
wanting to him; and hence on the experience of others, and on the results which they deduced from it, he put a
value far beyond its real one; and thus led himself still deeper into error. What he wanted, he conceived he might
most readily acquire if he undertook to collect and retain whatever memorable thought he should meet with, in
reading or in conversation. He accordingly recorded his own or other men's opinions, may wrote whole dialogues,
when they chanced to interest him. But unhappily by this means he held fast the false no less firmly than the true;
he dwelt far too long on one idea, particularly when it was of an aphoristic shape; and thus he left his natural
mode of thought and action, and frequently took foreign lights for his loadstars. Aurelia's bitterness, and Laertes's
cold contempt for men, warped his judgment oftener than they should have done: but no one, in his present case,
would have been so dangerous as Jarno, a man whose clear intellect could form a just and rigorous decision about
present things; but who erred withal in enunciating these particular decisions with a kind of universal application;
whereas, in truth, the judgments of the understanding are properly of force but once, and that in the strictest cases,
and become inaccurate in some degree when applied to any other.

Thus Wilhelm, striving to become consistent with himself, was deviating farther and farther from wholesome
consistency; and this confusion made it easier for his passions to employ their whole artillery against him, and
thus still farther to perplex his views of duty.
Serlo did not fail to take advantage of the late tidings: and in truth he daily had more reason to be anxious about
some fresh arrangement of his people. Either he must soon renew his old contracts; a measure he was not
specially fond of, for several of his actors, who reckoned themselves indispensable, were growing more and more
arrogant; or else he must entirely new−model and reform his company; which plan he looked upon as preferable.
Though he did not personally importune our friend, he set Aurelia and Philina on him: and the other wanderers,
longing for some kind of settlement, on their side gave Wilhelm not a moment's rest; so that he stood hesitating in
his choice, in no slight embarrassment, till he should decide. Who would have thought that a letter of Werner's,
written with quite different views, should have forced him on resolving? We shall omit the introduction, and give
the rest of it with little alteration.

Chapter II
"IT was therefore, and it always must be, right for every one, on any opportunity, to follow his vocation and
exhibit his activity. Scarcely had the good old man been gone a quarter of an hour, when everything in the house
began moving by a different plan than his. Friends, acquaintances, relations, crowded forward; especially all sorts
of people who on such occasions use to gain anything. They fetched and carried, they counted, wrote and
reckoned; some brought wine and meat, others ate and drank; and none seemed busier than the women getting out
the mournings.
"Such being the case, thou wilt not blame me that, in this emergency, I likewise thought of my advantage. I made
myself as active, and as helpful to thy sister, as I could; and so soon as it was any way decorous, signified to her
that it had now become our business to accelerate a union, which our parents in their too great circumspection had
hitherto postponed.
"Do not suppose, however, that it came into our heads to take possession of that monstrous empty house. We are
more modest, and more rational. Thou shalt hear our plan: thy sister, so soon as we are married, comes to our
house; and thy mother comes along with her. 'How can that be?' thou wilt say; 'you have scarcely room for
yourselves in that hampered nest.' There lies the art of it, my friend! Good packing renders all things possible;
thou wouldst not believe what space one finds, when one desires to occupy little. The large house we shall sell; an
opportunity occurs for this; and the money we shall draw for it will produce a hundred−fold.
"I hope this meets thy views: I hope also thou hast not inherited the smallest particle of those unprofitable tastes
for which thy father and thy grandfather were noted. The latter placed his greatest happiness in having about him
a multitude of dull−looking works of art, which no one, I may well say no one, could enjoy with him; the former
lived in a stately pomp, which he suffered no one to enjoy with him. We mean to manage otherwise, and we
expect thy approbation.
"It is true, I myself in all the house have no place whatever but the stool before my writing−desk; and I see not
clearly where they will be able to put a cradle down: but in return, the room we shall have out of doors will be the
more abundant. Coffee−houses and clubs for the husband; walks and drives for the wife: and pleasant country
jaunts for both. But the chief advantage in our plan is, that the round table being now completely filled, our father
cannot ask his friends to dinner, who the more he strove to entertain them, used to laugh at him the more.
"Now, no superfluity for us! Not too much furniture and apparatus; no coach, no horses! Nothing but money; and
the liberty, day after day, to do what you like in reason. No wardrobes; still the best and newest on your back: the

man may wear his coat till it is done; the wife may truck her gown the moment it is going out of fashion. There is
nothing so unsufferable to me as an old huckster's shop of property. If you would offer me a jewel, on condition
of my wearing it daily on my finger, I would not accept it; for how can one conceive any pleasure in a dead
capital? This then is my confession of faith: To transact your business, to make money, to be merry with your
household; and about the rest of the earth to trouble yourself no farther than where you can be of service to it.
"But ere now thou art saying: 'And pray what is to be done with me in this sage plan of yours? Where shall I find
shelter, when you have sold my own house, and not the smallest room remains in yours?'
"This is in truth the main point, brother; and in this too I shall have it in my power to serve thee. But first I must
present the just tribute of my praise for time so spent as thine has been.
"Tell me, how hast thou within a few weeks become so skilled in every useful, interesting object? Highly as I
thought of thy powers, I did not reckon such attention and such diligence among the number. Thy journal shows
us with what profit thou art travelling. The description of the iron and the copper forges is exquisite; it evinces a
complete knowledge of the subject. I myself was once there; but my relation, compared with this, has but a very
bungled look. The whole letter on the linen−trade is full of information; the remarks on commercial competition
are at once just and striking. In one or two places there are errors in addition, which indeed are very pardonable.
"But what most delights my father and myself is thy thorough knowledge of husbandry, and the improvement of
landed property. We have thoughts of purchasing a large estate, at present under sequestration, in a very fruitful
district. For paying it, we mean to use the money realised by the sale of the house; another portion we shall
borrow; a portion may remain unpaid. And we count on thee for going thither, and superintending the
improvement of it; by which means, before many years are passed, the land, to speak in moderation, will have
risen above a third in value. We shall then bring it to the market again; seek out a larger piece; improve and trade
as formerly. For all this, thou art the man. Our pens, meanwhile, will not lie idle here; and so by and by we shall
rise to be enviable people.
"For the present, fare thee well! Enjoy life on thy journey, and turn thy face wherever thou canst find contentment
and advantage. For the next half year we shall not need thee; thou canst look about thee in the world as thou
pleasest; a judicious person finds his best instruction in his travels. Farewell! I rejoice at being connected with
thee so closely by relation, and now united with thee in the spirit of activity."
Well as this letter might be penned, and full of economical truths as it was, Wilhelm felt displeased with it for
more than one reason. The praise bestowed on him for his pretended statistical, technological and rural
knowledge, was a silent reprimand. The ideal of the happiness of civic life, which his worthy brother sketched, by
no means charmed him; on the contrary, a secret spirit of contradiction dragged him forcibly the other way. He
convinced himself that, except on the stage, he could nowhere find that mental culture which he longed to give
himself: he seemed to grow the more decided in his resolution, the more strongly Werner, without knowing it,
opposed him. Thus assailed, he collected all his arguments together, and buttressed his opinions in his mind the
more carefully, the more desirable he reckoned it to show them in a favourable light to Werner; and in this
manner he produced an answer, which also we insert.

Chapter III
"THY letter is so well written, and so prudently and wisely conceived, that no objection can be made to it. Only
thou must pardon me, when I declare that one may think, maintain and do directly the reverse, and yet be in the
right as well as thou. Thy mode of being and imagining appears to turn on boundless acquisition, and a light
mirthful manner of enjoyment: I need scarcely tell thee, that in all this I find little that can charm me.

Chapter III

141

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
"First, however, I am sorry to admit, that my journal is none of mine! Under the pressure of necessity, and to
satisfy my father, it was patched together by a friend's help, out of many books; and though in words I know the
objects it relates to, and more of the like sort, I by no means understand them, or can occupy myself about them.
What good were it for me to manufacture perfect iron, while my own breast is full of dross? What would it stead
me to put properties of land in order, while I am at variance with myself?
"To speak it in a word; the cultivation of my individual self, here as I am, has from my youth upwards been
constantly though dimly my wish and my purpose. The same intention I still cherish, but the means of realising it
are now grown somewhat clearer. I have seen more of life than thou believest, and profited more by it also. Give
some attention then to what I say, though it should not altogether tally with thy own opinions.
"Had I been a nobleman, our dispute would soon have been decided; but being a simple burgher, I must take a
path of my own; and I fear it may be difficult to make thee understand me. I know not how it is in foreign
countries; but in Germany, a universal, and if I may say so, personal cultivation is beyond the reach of any one
except a nobleman. A burgher may acquire merit; by excessive efforts he may even educate his mind; but his
personal qualities are lost, or worse than lost, let him struggle as he will. Since the nobleman, frequenting the
society of the most polished, is compelled to give himself a polished manner; since this manner, neither door nor
gate being shut against him, grows at last an unconstrained one; since, in court or camp, his figure, his person, are
a part of his possessions, and it may be the most necessary part,−he has reason enough to put some value on them,
and to show that he puts some. A certain stately grace in common things, a sort of gay elegance in earnest and
important ones, becomes him well; for it shows him to be everywhere in equilibrium. He is a public person, and
the more cultivated his movements, the more sonorous his voice, the more staid and measured his whole being is,
the more perfect is he. If to high and low, to friends and relations, he continues still the same, then nothing can be
said against him, none may wish him otherwise. His coldness must be reckoned clearness of head, his
dissimulation prudence. If he can rule himself externally at every moment of his life, no man has aught more to
demand of him; and whatever else there may be in him or about him, capacities, talents, wealth, all seem gifts of
supererogation.
"Now imagine any burgher offering ever to pretend to these advantages, he will utterly fail; and the more
completely, the greater inclination and the more endowments nature may have given him for that mode of being.
"Since, in common life, the nobleman is hampered by no limits: since kings, or kinglike figures do not differ from
him, he can everywhere advance with a silent consciousness, as if before his equals, everywhere he is entitled to
press forward; whereas nothing more beseems the burgher than the quiet feeling of the limits that are drawn round
him. The burgher may not ask himself: 'What are thou?' He can only ask: 'What has thou? What discernment,
knowledge, talent, wealth?' If the nobleman, merely by his personal carriage, offers all that can be asked of him,
the burgher by his personal carriage offers nothing, and can offer nothing. The former had a right to seem; the
latter is compelled to be, and what he aims at seeming becomes ludicrous and tasteless. The former does and
makes, the latter but effects and procures; he must cultivate some single gifts in order to be useful, and it is
beforehand settled, that in his manner of existence there is no harmony, and can be none, since he is bound to
make himself of use in one department, and so has to relinquish all the others.
"Perhaps the reason of this difference is not the usurpation of the nobles, and the submission of the burghers, but
the constitution of society itself. Whether it will ever alter, and how, is to me of small importance: my present
business is to meet my own case, as matters actually stand; to consider by what means I may save myself, and
reach the object which I cannot live in peace without.
"Now this harmonious cultivation of my nature, which has been denied me by birth, is exactly what I most long
for. Since leaving thee, I have gained much by voluntary practice: I have laid aside much of my wonted
embarrassment, and can bear myself in very tolerable style. My speech and voice I have likewise been attending
to; and I may say, without much vanity, that in society I do not cause displeasure. But I will not conceal from
Chapter III

142

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
thee, that my inclination to become a public person, and to please and influence in a larger circle, is daily growing
more insuperable. With this, there is combined my love for poetry and all that is related to it; and the necessity I
feel to cultivate my mental faculties and tastes, that so, in this enjoyment henceforth indispensable, I may esteem
as good the good alone, as beautiful the beautiful alone. Thou seest well, that for me all this is nowhere to be met
with except upon the stage; that in this element alone can I effect and cultivate myself according to my wishes. On
the boards, a polished man appears in his splendour with personal accomplishments, just as he does so in the
upper classes of society; body and spirit must advance with equal steps in all his studies; and there I shall have it
in my power at once to be and seem, as well as anywhere. If I farther long for solid occupations, we have there
mechanical vexations in abundance; I may give my patience daily exercise.
"Dispute not with me on this subject: for ere thou writest, the step is taken. In compliance with the ruling
prejudices, I will change my name, as indeed that of Meister of Master does not suit me. Farewell! Our fortune is
in good hands: on that subject I shall not disturb myself. What I need I will, as occasion calls, require from thee: it
will not be much; for I hope my art will be sufficient to maintain me."
Scarcely was the letter sent away, when our friend made good his words. To the great surprise of Serlo and the
rest, he at once declared that he was ready to become an actor, and bind himself by a contract on reasonable
terms. With regard to these they were soon agreed: for Serlo had before made offers, with which Wilhelm and his
comrades had good reason to be satisfied. The whole of that unlucky company, wherewith we have had so long to
occupy ourselves, was now at once received; and except perhaps Laertes, not a member of it showed the smallest
thankfulness to Wilhelm. As they had entreated without confidence, so they accepted without gratitude. Most of
them preferred ascribing their appointment to the influence of Philina, and directed their thanks to her. Meanwhile
the contracts had been written out, and were now a−signing. At the moment when our friend was subscribing his
assumed designation, by some inexplicable concatenation of ideas, there arose before his mind's eye the image of
that green in the forest, where he lay wounded in Philina's lap. The lovely Amazon came riding on her gray
palfrey from the bushes of the wood; she approached him, and dismounted. Her humane anxiety made her come
and go; at length she stood before him. The white surtout fell down from her shoulders; her countenance, her form
began to glance in radiance, and she vanished from his sight. He wrote his name mechanically only, not knowing
what he did; and felt not, till after he had signed, that Mignon was standing at his side, was holding by his arm,
and had softly tried to stop him and pull back his hand.

Chapter IV
ONE of the conditions, under which our friend had gone upon the stage, was not acceded to by Serlo without
some limitations. Wilhelm had required that Hamlet should be played entire and unmutilated; the other had agreed
to this strange stipulation, in so far as it was possible. On this point they had many a contest; for as to what was
possible or not possible, and what parts of the piece could be omitted without mutilating it, the two were of very
different opinions.
Wilhelm was still in that happy season, when one cannot understand how, in the woman one loves, in the writer
one honours, there should be anything defective. The feeling they excite in us is so entire, so accordant with itself,
that we cannot help attributing the same perfect harmony to the objects themselves. Serlo again was willing to
discriminate, perhaps too willing: his acute understanding could usually discern in any work of art nothing but a
more or less imperfect whole. He thought, that as pieces usually stood, there was little reason to be chary about
meddling with them; that of course Shakspeare, and particularly Hamlet, would need to suffer much curtailment.
But when Serlo talked of separating the wheat from the chaff, Wilhelm would not hear of it. "It is not chaff and
wheat together," said he: "It is a trunk with boughs, twigs, leaves, buds, blossoms and fruit. Is not the one there
with the others, and by means of them?" To which Serlo would reply, that people did not bring a whole tree upon
the table; that the artist was required to present his guests with silver apples in platters of silver. They exhausted
Chapter IV

143

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
their invention in similitudes: and their opinions seemed still farther to diverge.
Our friend was on the borders of despair, when, on one occasion, after much debating, Serlo counselled him to
take the simple plan; to make a brief resolution, to grasp his pen, to peruse the tragedy; dashing out whatever
would not answer, compressing several personages into one: and if he was not skilled in such proceedings, or had
not heart enough for going through with them, he might leave the task to him, the Manager, who would engage to
make short work with it.
"That is not our bargain," answered Wilhelm. "How can you, with all your taste, show so much levity?"
"My friend," cried Serlo, "you yourself will ere long feel it and show it. I know too well how shocking such a
mode of treating works is: perhaps it never was allowed on any theatre till now. But where indeed was ever one so
slighted as ours? Authors force us on this wretched clipping system, and the public tolerates it. How many pieces
have we, pray, which do not overstep the measure of our numbers, of our decorations and theatrical machinery, of
the proper time, of the fit alternation of dialogue, and the physical strength of the actor? And yet we are to play,
and play, and constantly give novelties. Ought we not to profit by our privilege then, since we accomplish just as
much by mutilated works as by entire ones? It is the public itself that grants the privilege. Few Germans, perhaps
few men of any modern nation, have a proper sense of an asthetic whole: they praise and blame by passages; they
are charmed by passages: and who has greater reason to rejoice at this than actors, since the stage is ever but a
patched and piecework matter?"
"Is!" cried Wilhelm; "but must it ever be so? Must everything that is continue? Convince me not that you are
right: for no power on earth should force me to abide by any contract which I had concluded with the grossest
misconceptions."
Serlo gave a merry turn to the business; and persuaded Wilhelm to review once more the many conversations they
had had together about Hamlet; and himself to invent some means of properly reforming the piece.
After a few days, which he had spent alone, our friend returned with a cheerful look. "I am much mistaken," cried
he, "if I have not now discovered how the whole is to be managed: nay, I am convinced that Shakspeare himself
would have arranged it so, had not his mind been too exclusively directed to the ruling interest, and perhaps
misled by the novels, which furnished materials."
"Let us hear," said Serlo, placing himself with an air of solemnity upon the sofa; "I will listen calmly; but judge
with rigour."
"I am not afraid of you," said Wilhelm; "only hear me. In the composition of this play, after the most accurate
investigation and the most mature reflection, I distinguish two classes of objects. The first are the grand internal
relations of the persons and events, the powerful effects which arise from the characters and proceedings of the
main figures: these, I hold, are individually excellent, and the order in which they are presented cannot be
improved. No kind of interference must be suffered to destroy them, or even essentially to change their form.
These are the things which stamp themselves deep into the soul; which all men long to see, which no one dares to
meddle with. Accordingly, I understand, they have almost wholly been retained in all our German theaters. But
our countrymen have erred, in my opinion, with regard to the second class of objects, which may be observed in
this tragedy; I allude to the external relations of the persons, whereby they are brought from place to place, or
combined in various ways by certain accidental incidents. These they have looked upon as very unimportant; have
spoken of them only in passing, or left them out altogether. Now, indeed, it must be owned, these threads are
slack and slender; yet they run through the entire piece, and bind together much that would otherwise fall asunder,
and does actually fall asunder, when you cut them off, and imagine you have done enough and more, if you have
left the ends hanging.

Chapter IV

144

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
"Among these external relations I include the disturbances in Norway, the war with young Fortinbras, the
embassy to his uncle, the settling of that feud, the march of young Fortinbras to Poland, and his coming back at
the end; of the same sort are Horatio's return from Wittenberg, Hamlet's wish to go thither, the journey of Laertes
to France, his return, the dispatch of Hamlet into England, his capture by pirates, the death of the two courtiers by
the letter which they carried. All these circumstances and events would be very fit for expanding and lengthening
a novel; but here they injure exceedingly the unity of the piece, particularly as the hero has no plan, and are in
consequence entirely out of place."
"For once in the right!" cried Serlo.
"Do not interrupt me," answered Wilhelm; "perhaps you will not always think me right. These errors are like
temporary props of an edifice; they must not be removed till we have built a firm wall in their stead. My project
therefore is, not at all to change those first−mentioned grand situations, or at least as much as possible to spare
them, but collectively and individually; but with respect to these external, single, dissipated and dissipating
motives, to cast them all at once away, and substitute a solitary one instead of them."
"And this?" inquired Serlo, springing up from his recumbent posture.
"It lies in the piece itself," answered Wilhelm, "only I employ it rightly. There are disturbances in Norway. You
shall hear my plan, and try it.
"After the death of Hamlet the father, the Norwegians, lately conquered, grow unruly. The viceroy of that country
sends his son, Horatio, an old school−friend of Hamlet's, and distinguished above every other for his bravery and
prudence, to Denmark, to press forward the equipment of the fleet, which, under the new luxurious king, proceeds
but slowly. Horatio has known the former king, having fought in his battles, having even stood in favour with
him; a circumstance by which the first ghost−scene will be nothing injured. The new sovereign gives Horatio
audience, and sends Laertes into Norway with intelligence that the fleet will soon arrive, whilst Horatio is
commissioned to accelerate the preparation of it; and the Queen, on the other hand, will not consent that Hamlet,
as he wishes, should go to sea along with him."
"Heaven be praised!" cried Serlo; "we shall now get rid of Wittenberg and the university, which was always a
sorry piece of business. I think your idea extremely good; for except these two distant objects, Norway and the
fleet, the spectator will not be required to fancy anything: the rest he will see; the rest takes place before him;
whereas his imagination, on the other plan, was hunted over all the world."
"You easily perceive," said Wilhelm, "how I shall contrive to keep the other parts together. When Hamlet tells
Horatio of his uncle's crime, Horatio counsels him to go to Norway in his company, to secure the affections of the
army, and return in warlike force. Hamlet also is becoming dangerous to the King and Queen; they find no readier
method of deliverance than to send him in the fleet, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to be spies upon him; and
as Laertes in the mean time comes from France, they determine that this youth, exasperated even to murder, shall
go after him. Unfavourable winds detain the fleet; Hamlet returns: for his wandering through the churchyard
perhaps some lucky motive may be thought of; his meeting with Laertes in Ophelia's grave is a grand moment,
which we must not part with. After this, the King resolves that it is better to get quit of Hamlet on the spot; the
festival of his departure, the pretended reconcilement with Laertes, are now solemnised; on which occasion
knightly sports are held, and Laertes fights with Hamlet. Without the four corpses I cannot end the piece; not one
of them can possibly be left. The right of popular election now again comes in force, and Hamlet gives his dying
voice for Horatio."
"Quick! quick!" said Serlo; "sit down and work the piece: your plan has my entire approbation; only do not let
your zeal for it evaporate."

Chapter V
WILHELM had already been for some time busied with translating Hamlet; making use, as he laboured, of
Wieland's spirited performance, by means of which he had first become acquainted with Shakspeare. What in
Wieland's work had been omitted he replaced; and he had at length procured himself a complete version, at the
very time when Serlo and he finally agreed about the way of treating it. He now began, according to his plan, to
cut out and insert, to separate and unite, to alter and often to restore; for, satisfied as he was with his own
conception, it still appeared to him as if in executing it he were but spoiling the original.
So soon as all was finished, he read his work to Serlo and the rest. They declared themselves exceedingly
contented with it; Serlo, in particular, made many flattering observations.
"You have felt very justly," said he, among other things, "that some external circumstances must accompany this
piece; but that they must be simpler than those which the great poet has employed. What takes place without the
theatre, what the spectator does not see, but must imagine for himself, is like a background, in front of which the
acting figures move. Your large and simple prospect of the fleet and Norway will very much improve the piece; if
this were altogether taken from it, we should have but a family−scene remaining; and the great idea, that here a
kingly house by internal crimes and incongruities goes down to ruin, would not be presented with its proper
dignity. But if the former background were left standing, so manifold, so fluctuating and confused, it would hurt
the impression of the figures."
Wilhelm again took Shakspeare's part; alleging that he wrote for islanders, for Englishmen, who generally in the
distance were accustomed to see little else than ships and voyages, the coasts of France and privateers; and thus
what perplexed and distracted others, was to them quite natural.
Serlo assented; and both of them were of opinion, that as the piece was now to be produced upon the German
stage, this more serious and simple background was the best adapted for the German mind.
The parts had been distributed before: Serlo undertook Polonius; Aurelia undertook Ophelia; Laertes was already
designated by his name; a young, thickest, jolly new−comer was to be Horatio; the King and the Ghost alone
occasioned some perplexity. For both of these there was no one but Old Boisterous remaining. Serlo proposed to
make the Pedant King; but against this our friend protested in the strongest terms. They could resolve on nothing.
Wilhelm also had allowed both Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to continue in his piece. "Why not compress them
into one?" said Serlo. "This abbreviation will not cost you much."
"Heaven keep me from all such curtailments!" answered Wilhelm, "they destroy at once the sense and the effect.
What these two persons are and do, it is impossible to represent by one. In such small matters we discover
Shakspeare's greatness. These soft approaches, this smirking and bowing, this assenting, wheedling, flattering,
this whisking agility, this wagging of the tail, this allness and emptiness, this legal knavery, this ineptitude and
insipidity,−how can they be expressed by a single man? There ought to be at least a dozen of these people, if they
could be had: for it is only in society that they are anything; they are society itself; and Shakspeare showed no
little wisdom and discernment in bringing in a pair of them. Besides, I need them as a couple that may be
contrasted with the single, noble, excellent Horatio."
"I understand you," answered Serlo, "and we can arrange it. One of them we shall hand over to Elmira, Old
Boisterous's eldest daughter: it will all be right, if they look well enough, and I will deck and trim the puppets so
that it shall be a pleasure to behold them."
Philina was rejoicing not a little that she had to act the Duchess in the small subordinate play. "I will show it so

natural," cried she, "how you wed a second without loss of time, when you have loved the first immensely. I hope
to gain the loudest plaudits, and every man shall wish he were the third."
Aurelia gave a frown; her spleen against Philina was increasing every day.
"'Tis a pity, I declare," said Serlo, "that we have no ballet; else you should dance me a pas de deux with your first,
and then another with your second husband,−and the first might dance himself to sleep by the measure; and your
bits of feet and ankles would look so pretty, tripping to and fro upon the side stage."
"Of my ankles you do not know much," replied she snappishly; "and as to my bits of feet," cried she, hastily
reaching below the table, pulling off her slippers, and holding them together out to Serlo; "here are the cases of
them, and I give you leave to find me nicer ones."
"It were a serious task," said he, looking at the elegant half−shoe. "In truth, one does not often meet with anything
so dainty."
They were of Parisian workmanship: Philina had obtained them as a present from the Countess, a lady whose foot
was celebrated for its beauty.
"A charming thing !" cried Serlo; "my heart leaps at the sight of them."
"What gallant throbs !" replied Philina.
"There is nothing in the world beyond a pair of slippers," said he; "of such pretty manufacture, in their proper
time and place, when"
Philina took her slippers from his hands, crying, "You have squeezed them all ! They are far too wide for me !"
She played with them, and rubbed the soles of them together. "How hot it is !" cried she, clapping the sole upon
her cheek, then again rubbing, and holding it to Serlo. he was innocent enough to stretch out his hand to feel the
warmth. "Clip ! clap the heel, so that he screamed and drew back his hand; "I will teach you to use my slippers
better."
"And I will teach you to use old folk like children," cried the other; then sprang up, seized her, and plundered
many a kiss, everyone of which she artfully contested with a show of serious reluctance. In this romping, her long
hair got loose, and floated round the group; the chair overset; and Aurelia, inwardly indignant at such rioting,
arose in great vexation.

Chapter VI
THOUGH in this remoulding of Hamlet many characters had been cut off, a sufficient number of them still
remained; a number which the company was scarcely adequate to meet.
"If this is the way of it," said Serlo, "our prompter himself must issue from his den, and mount the stage, and
become a personage like one of us."
"In his own station," answered Wilhelm, "I have frequently admired him."
"I do not think," said Serlo, "that there is in the world a more perfect artist of his kind. No spectator ever hears
him; we upon the stage catch every syllable. He has formed in himself, as it were, a peculiar set of vocal organs
for this purpose; he is like a Genius that whispers intelligibly to us in the hour of need. He feels as if instinct what

portion of his task an actor is completely master of; and anticipates from afar where his memory will fail him. I
have known cases, in which I myself had scarcely read my part; he said it over to me word for word, and I played
happily. Yet he has some peculiarities, which would make another in his place quite useless. For example, he
takes such an interest in the pieces, that in giving any moving passage, he does not indeed declaim it, but he reads
it with all pomp and pathos. By this ill habit he has nonplussed me on more than one occasion."
"As with another of his singularities," observed Aurelia, "he once left me sticking fast in a very dangerous
passage."
"How could this happen, with the man's attentiveness?" said Wilhelm.
"He is so affected," said Aurelia, "by certain passages, that he weeps warm tears, and for a few moments loses all
reflection; and it is not properly passages such as we should call affecting that produce this impression on him;
but, if I express myself clearly, the beautiful passages, those out of which the pure spirit of the poet looks forth, as
it were, through open sparkling eyes; passages which others at most rejoice over, and which many thousands
altogether overlook."
"And with a soul so tender, why does he never venture on the stage?"
"A hoarse voice," said Serlo, "and a stiff carriage exclude him from it; as his melancholic temper excludes him
from society. What trouble have I taken, and in vain, to make myself familiar with him! But he is a charming
reader; such another I have never heard; no one can observe like him the narrow limit between declamation and
graceful recital."
"The very man!" exclaimed our friend, "the very man! What a fortunate discovery! We have now the proper hand
for delivering the passage of The rugged Pyrrhus."
"One requires your eagerness," said Serlo, "before one can employ every object in the use it was meant for."
"In truth," said Wilhelm, "I was very much afraid we should be obliged to leave this passage out; the omission
would have lamed the whole play."
"Well! That is what I cannot understand," observed Aurelia.
"I hope you will ere long be of my opinion," answered Wilhelm. "Shakspeare has introduced these travelling
players with a double purpose. The person who recites the death of Priam with such feeling, in the first place,
makes a deep impression on the Prince himself; he sharpens the conscience of the wavering youth: and,
accordingly, this scene becomes a prelude to that other, where, in the second place, the little play produces such
effect upon the King. Hamlet sees himself reproved and put to shame by the player, who feels so deep a sympathy
in foreign fictitious woes: and the thought of making an experiment upon the conscience of his stepfather is in
consequence suggested to him. What a royal monologue is that, which ends the second act! How charming it will
be to speak it!"O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!Is it not monstrous that this player here,But in a fiction, in a
dream of passion,Could force his soul so to his own conceit,That from her working all his visage wann'd;Tears in
his eyes, distraction in his aspect,A broken voice, and his whole function suitingWith forms to his conceit? And
all for nothing!For Hecuba! What's Hecuba to him,Or he to Hecuba, that he should weep for her?"
"If we can but persuade our man to come upon the stage," observed Aurelia.
"We must lead him to it by degrees," said Serlo. "At the rehearsal, he may read the passage; we shall tell him that
an actor whom we are expecting is to play it; and so, by and by, we shall lead him nearer to the point."

Chapter VI

Having agreed on this affair, the conversation next turned upon the Ghost. Wilhelm could not bring himself to
give the part of the living King to the Pedant, that so Old Boisterous might play the Ghost: he was of opinion that
they ought to wait a while; because some other actors had announced themselves, and among these it was
probable they would find a fitter man.
We can easily conceive, then, how astonished Wilhelm must have been, when returning home that evening, he
found a billet lying on his table, sealed with singular figures, and containing what follows:
"Strange youth! we know thou art in great perplexity. For thy Hamlet thou canst hardly find men enough, not to
speak of Ghosts. Thy zeal deserves a miracle: miracles we cannot work; but somewhat marvellous shall happen. If
thou have faith, the Ghost shall arise at the proper hour! Be of courage and keep firm! This needs no answer: thy
determination will be known to us."
With this curious sheet he hastened back to Serlo, who read it and re−read it, and at last declared with a thoughtful
look, that it seemed a matter of some moment; that they must consider well and seriously whether they could risk
it. They talked the subject over at some length; Aurelia was silent, only smiling now and then; and a few days
after, when speaking of the incident again, she gave our friend, not obscurely, to understand, that she held it all for
a joke of Serlo's. She desired him to cast away anxiety, and to expect the Ghost with patience.
Serlo, for most part, was in excellent humour: the actors that were going to leave him took all possible pains to
play well, that their absence might be properly regretted; and this, combined with the newfangled zeal of the
others, gave promise of the best results.
His intercourse with Wilhelm had not failed to exert some influence on him. He began to speak more about art:
for, after all, he was a German; and Germans like to give themselves account of what they do. Wilhelm wrote
down many of their conversations; which, as our narrative must not be so often interrupted here, we shall
communicate to such of our readers as feel an interest in dramaturgic matters, by some other opportunity.
In particular, one evening, the Manager was very merry in speaking of the part of Polonius, and how he meant to
take it up. "I engage," said he, "on this occasion, to present a very meritorious person in his best aspect. The
repose and security of this old gentleman, his emptiness and his significance, his exterior gracefulness and interior
meanness, his frankness and sycophancy, his sincere roguery and deceitful truth, I will introduce with all due
elegance in their fit proportions. This respectable, gray−haired, enduring time−serving half−knave I will represent
in the most courtly style: the occasional roughness and coarseness of our author's strokes will further me here. I
will speak like a book, when I am prepared beforehand; and like an ass, when I utter the overflowings of my
heart. I will be insipid and absurd enough to chime−in with every one; and acute enough never to observe when
people make a mock of me. I have seldom taken up a part with so much zeal and roguishness."
"Could I but hope as much from mine!" exclaimed Aurelia. "I have neither youth nor softness enough to be at
home in this character. One thing alone I am too sure of; the feeling that turns Ophelia's brain, I shall not want."
"We must not take the matter up so strictly," said our friend. "For my share, I am certain, that the wish to act the
character of Hamlet has led me exceedingly astray, throughout my study of the piece. And now the more I look
into the part, the more clearly do I see, that in my whole form and physiognomy, there is not one feature such as
Shakspeare meant for Hamlet. When I consider with what nicety the various circumstances are adapted to each
other, I can scarcely hope to produce even a tolerable effect."
"You are entering on your new career with becoming conscientiousness," said Serlo. "The actor fits himself to his
part as he can, and the part to him as it must. But how has Shakspeare drawn his Hamlet? Is he then so utterly
unlike you?"

Chapter VI

149

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
"In the first place," answered Wilhelm, "he is fair−haired."
"That I call farfetched," observed Aurelia. "How do you infer that?"
"As a Dane, as a Northman, he is fair−haired and blue−eyed by descent."
"And you think Shakspeare had this in view?"
"I do not find it specially expressed; but, by comparison of passages, I think it incontestable. The fencing tires
him; the sweat is running from his brow; and the Queen remarks: He's fat and scant of breath. Can you conceive
him to be otherwise than plump and fair−haired? Brown−complexioned people in their youth are seldom plump.
And does not his wavering melancholy, his soft lamenting, his irresolute activity, accord with such a figure? From
a dark−haired young man you would look for more decision and impetuosity."
"You are spoiling my imagination," cried Aurelia: "away with your fat Hamlets! Do not set your well−fed Prince
before us! Give us rather any succedaneum that will move us, will delight us. The intention of the author is of less
importance to us than our own enjoyment, and we need a charm that is adapted for us."

Chapter VII
ONE evening a dispute arose among our friends about the novel and the drama, and which of them deserved the
preference. Serlo said it was a fruitless and misunderstood debate; both might be superior in their kinds, only each
must keep within the limits proper to it.
"About their limits and their kinds," said Wilhelm, "I confess myself not altogether clear."
"Who is so?" said the other; "and yet perhaps it were worth while to come a little closer to the business."
They conversed together long upon the matter; and in fine, the following was nearly the result of their discussion:
"In the novel as well as in the drama, it is human nature and human action that we see. The difference between
these sorts of fiction lies not merely in their outward form; not merely in the circumstance that the personages of
the one are made to speak, while those of the other have commonly their history narrated. Unfortunately many
dramas are but novels, which proceed by dialogue; and it would not be impossible to write a drama in the shape of
letters.
"But in the novel, it is chiefly sentiments and events that are exhibited; in the drama, it is characters and deeds.
The novel must go slowly forward; and the sentiments of the hero, by some means or another, must restrain the
tendency of the whole to unfold itself and to conclude. The drama on the other hand, must hasten, and the
character of the hero must press forward to the end; it does not restrain, but is restrained. The novel−hero must be
suffering, at least he must not in a high degree be active; in the dramatic one, we look for activity and deeds.
Grandison, Clarissa, Pamela, the Vicar of Wakefield, Tom Jones himself, are, if not suffering, at least retarding
personages; and the incidents are all in some sort modelled by their sentiments. In the drama the hero models
nothing by himself; all things with stand him, and he clears and casts away the hindrances from off his path, or
else sinks under them."
Our friends were also of opinion, that in the novel some degree of scope may be allowed to Chance; but that it
must always be led and guided by the sentiments of the personages; on the other hand, that Fate, which, by means
of outward unconnected circumstances, carries forward men, without their own concurrence, to an unforeseen
catastrophe, can have place only in the drama; that Chance may produce pathetic situations, but never tragic ones;
Chapter VII

150

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Fate, on the other hand, ought always to be terrible; and is in the highest sense tragic, when it brings into a ruinous
concatenation the guilty man, and the guiltless that was unconcerned with him.
These considerations led them back to the play of Hamlet, and the peculiarities of its composition. The hero in
this case, it was observed, is endowed more properly with sentiments than with a character; it is events alone that
push him on; and accordingly the piece has in some measure the expansion of a novel. But as it is Fate that draws
the plan; as the story issues from a deed of terror, and the hero is continually driven forward to a deed of terror,
the work is tragic in the highest sense, and admits of no other than a tragic end.
They were now to study and peruse the piece in common; to commence what are called the book−rehearsals.
These Wilhelm had looked forward to as to a festival. Having formerly collated all the parts, no obstacle on this
side could oppose him. The whole of the actors were acquainted with the piece; he endeavoured to impress their
minds with the importance of these book−rehearsals. "As you require," said he, "of every musical performer, that
he shall, in some degree, be able to play from the book; so every actor, every educated man, should train himself
to recite from the book, to catch immediately the character of any drama, any poem, any tale he may be reading,
and exhibit it with grace and readiness. No committing of the piece to memory will be of service, if the actor have
not in the first place penetrated into the sense and spirit of his author; the mere letter will avail him nothing."
Serlo declared, that he would overlook all subsequent rehearsals, the last rehearsal itself, if justice were but done
to these rehearsals from the book. "For commonly," said he, "there is nothing more amusing than to hear an actor
speak of study; it is as if freemasons were to talk of building."
The rehearsal passed according to their wishes; and we may assert, that the fame and favour which our company
acquired afterwards, had their foundation in these few but well−spent hours.
"You did right, my friend," said Serlo, when they were alone, "in speaking to our fellow−labourers so earnestly;
and yet I am afraid they will scarcely fulfil your wishes."
"How so?" asked Wilhelm.
"I have noticed," answered Serlo, "that as easily as you may set in motion the imaginations of men, gladly as they
listen to your tales and fictions, it is yet very seldom that you find among them any touch of an imagination you
can call productive. In actors this remark is strikingly exemplified. Any one of them is well content to undertake a
beautiful, praiseworthy, brilliant part; and seldom will any one of them do more than self−complacently transport
himself into his hero's place, without in the smallest troubling his head whether other people view him so or not.
But to seize with vivacity what the author's feeling was in writing; what portion of your individual qualities you
must cast off, in order to do justice to a part; how by your own conviction that you are become another man, you
may carry with you the convictions of the audience; how by the inward truth of your conceptive power, you can
change these boards into a temple, this pasteboard into woods; to seize and execute all this is given to very few.
That internal strength of soul, by which alone deception can be brought about; that lying truth, without which
nothing will affect us rightly, have by most men never even been imagined.
"Let us not then press too hard for spirit and feeling in our friends! The surest way is first coolly to instruct them
in the sense and letter of the piece; if possible, to open their understandings. Whoever has the talent will then, of
his own accord, eagerly adopt the spirited feeling and manner of expression; and those who have it not, will at
least be prevented from acting or reciting altogether falsely. And among actors, as indeed in all cases, there is no
worse arrangement than for any one to make pretensions to the spirit of a thing, while the sense and letter of it are
not ready and clear to him."

Chapter VII

Chapter VIII
COMING to the first stage rehearsal very early, Wilhelm found himself alone upon the boards. The appearance of
the place surprised him, and awoke the strangest recollections. A forest and village−scene stood exactly
represented as he once had seen it in the theatre of his native town. On that occasion also, a rehearsal was
proceeding; and it was the morning when Mariana first confessed her love to him, and promised him a happy
interview. The peasants' cottages resembled one another on the two stages, as they did in nature; the true morning
sun, beaming through a half−closed window−shutter, fell upon a part of a bench ill−joined to a cottage−door; but
unhappily it did not now enlighten Mariana's waist and bosom. He sat down, reflecting on this strange
coincidence: he almost thought that perhaps on this very spot he would soon see her again. And alas! the truth was
nothing more, than that an afterpiece to which this scene belonged was at that time very often played upon the
German stage.
Out of these meditations he was roused by the other actors; along with whom two amateurs, frequenters of the
wardrobe and stage, came in, and saluted Wilhelm with a show of great enthusiasm. One of these was in some
degree attached to Frau Melina: but the other was entirely a pure friend of art; and both were of the kind which a
good company should always wish to have about it. It was difficult to say whether their love for the stage or their
knowledge of it was the greater. They loved it too much to know it perfectly; they knew it well enough to prize
the good, and to discard the bad. But their inclination being so powerful, they could tolerate the mediocre; and the
glorious joy, which they experienced from the foretaste and the aftertaste of excellence, surpassed expression. The
mechanical department gave them pleasure, the intellectual charmed them; and so strong was their susceptibility,
that even a discontinuous rehearsal afforded them a species of illusion. Deficiencies appeared in their eyes to fade
away in distance; the successful touched them like an object near at hand. In a word, they were judges such as
every artist wishes in his own department. Their favourite movement was from the side−scenes to the pit, and
from the pit to the side−scenes; their happiest place was in the wardrobe; their busiest employment was in trying
to improve the dress, position, recitation, gesture of the actor; their liveliest conversation was on the effect
produced by him; their most constant effort was to keep him accurate, active and attentive, to do him service or
kindness, and, without squandering, to procure for the company a series of enjoyments. The two had obtained the
exclusive privilege of being present on the stage at rehearsals as well as exhibitions. In regard to Hamlet, they had
not in all points agreed with Wilhelm; here and there he had yielded; but for most part he had stood by his
opinion; and, upon the whole, these discussions had been very useful in the forming of his taste. He showed both
gentlemen how much he valued them; and they again predicted nothing less, from these combined endeavours,
than a new epoch for the German theatre.
The presence of these persons was of great service during the rehearsals. In particular, they laboured to convince
our players that, throughout the whole of their preparations, the posture and action, as they were intended
ultimately to appear, should always be combined with the words, and thus the whole be mechanically united by
habit. In rehearsing a tragedy especially, they said, no common movement with the hands should be allowed: a
tragic actor that took snuff in the rehearsal always frightened them; for, in all probability, on coming to the same
passage in the exhibition he would miss his pinch. Nay, on the same principles, they maintained that no one
should rehearse in boots, if his part were to be played in shoes. But nothing, they declared, afflicted them so much
as when the women, in rehearsing, stuck their hands into the folds of their gowns.
By the persuasion of our friends, another very good effect was brought about; the actors all began to learn the use
of arms. Since military parts occur so frequently, said they, can anything look more absurd than men without the
smallest particle of discipline, strolling about the stage in captains' and majors' uniforms?
Wilhelm and Laertes were the first that took lessons of a subaltern: they continued their practising of fence with
the greatest zeal.

Chapter VIII

152

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Such pains did our two amateurs give themselves for perfecting a company, which had so fortunately come
together. They were thus providing for the future satisfaction of the public, while the public was usually laughing
at their taste. People did not know what gratitude they owed our friends; particularly for performing one service,
the service of frequently impressing on the actor the fundamental point, that it was his duty to speak so loud as to
be heard. In this simple matter, they experienced more opposition and repugnance than could have been expected.
Most part maintained that they were heard well already; some laid the blame upon the building; others said, one
could not yell and bellow, when one had to speak naturally, secretly, or tenderly.
Our two friends having an immeasurable stock of patience, tried every means of undoing this delusion, of getting
round this obstinate self−will. They spared neither arguments nor flatteries; and at last they reached their object,
being aided not a little by the good example of Wilhelm. By him they were requested to sit down in the remotest
corners of the house; and every time they did not hear him perfectly, to rap on the bench with a key. He
articulated well, spoke out in a measured manner, raised his tones gradually, and did not overcry himself in the
most vehement passages, The rapping of the key was heard less and less every new rehearsal: by and by the rest
submitted to the same operation; and at last it seemed rational to hope, that the piece would be heard by every one
in all the nooks of the house.
From this example, we may see how desirous people are to reach their object in their own way; what need there
often is of enforcing on them truths which are self−evident; and how difficult it may be to reduce the man, who
aims at effecting something, to admit the primary conditions under which alone his enterprise is possible.

Chapter IX
THE NECESSARY preparations for scenery and dresses, and whatever else was requisite, were now proceeding.
In regard to certain scenes and passages, our friend had whims of his own, which Serlo humoured, partly in
consideration of their bargain, partly from conviction, and because he hoped by these civilities to gain Wilhelm,
and to lead him according to his own purposes the more implicitly in time to come.
Thus, for example, the King and Queen were, at the first audience, to appear sitting on the throne, with the
courtiers at the sides, and Hamlet standing undistinguished in the crowd. "Hamlet," said he, "must keep himself
quiet; his sable dress will sufficiently point him out. He should rather shun remark than seek it. Not till the
audience is ended, and the King speaks with him as with a son, should he advance, and allow the scene to take its
course."
A formidable obstacle still remained, in regard to the two pictures, which Hamlet so passionately refers to in the
scene with his mother. "We ought," said Wilhelm, "to have both of them visible, at full length, in the bottom of
the chamber, near the main door; and the former King must be clad in armour, like the Ghost, and hang at the side
where it enters. I could wish that the figure held its right hand in a commanding attitude; were somewhat turned
away; and as it were looked over its shoulder, that so it might perfectly resemble the Ghost at the moment when
he issues from the door. It will produce a great effect, when at this instant Hamlet looks upon the Ghost, and the
Queen upon the picture. The stepfather may be painted in royal ornaments, but not so striking."
There were several other points of this sort, about which we shall perhaps elsewhere have opportunity to speak.
"Are you then inexorably bent on Hamlet's dying at the end?" inquired Serlo.
"How can I keep him alive," said Wilhelm, "when the whole piece is pressing him to death? We have already
talked at large on that matter."
"But the public wishes him to live."
Chapter IX

153

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
"I will show the public any other complaisance; but as to this, I cannot. We often wish that some gallant useful
man, who is dying of a chronic disease, might yet live longer. The family weep, and conjure the physician, but he
cannot stay him; and no more than this physician can withstand the necessity of nature, can we give law to an
acknowledged necessity of art. It is a false compliance with the multitude, to raise in them emotions which they
wish, when these are not emotions which they ought, to feel."
"Whoever pays the cash," said Serlo, "may require the ware according to his liking."
"Doubtless, in some degree," replied our friend; "but a great public should be reverenced, not used as children are,
when pedlars wish to hook the money from them. By presenting excellence to the people, you should gradually
excite in them a taste and feeling for the excellent; and they will pay their money with double satisfaction, when
reason itself has nothing to object against this outlay. The public you may flatter, as you do a well−beloved child,
to better, to enlighten it; not as you do a pampered child of quality, to perpetuate the error you profit from."
In this manner, various other topics were discussed relating to the question: What might still be changed in the
piece, and what must of necessity remain untouched? We shall not enter farther on those points at present; but
perhaps at some future time we may admit this altered Hamlet itself to such of our readers as feel any interest in
the subject.

Chapter X
THE MAIN rehearsal was at length concluded; it had lasted very long. Serlo and Wilhelm still found much to
care for: notwithstanding all the time which had already been consumed in preparation, some highly necessary
matters had been left to the very last moment.
Thus, the pictures of the kings, for instance, were not ready; and the scene between Hamlet and his Mother, from
which so powerful an effect was looked for, had a very helpless aspect, as the business stood; for neither Ghost
nor painted image of him was at present forthcoming. Serlo made a jest of this perplexity: "We should be in a
pretty scrape," said he, "if the Ghost were to decline appearing, and the guard had nothing to fight with but the air,
and our prompter were obliged to speak the spirit's part from the side−scenes."
"We will not scare away our strange friend by unbelief," said Wilhelm: "doubtless at the proper season he will
come, and astonish us as much as the spectators."
"Well, certainly," said Serlo, "I shall be a happy man tomorrow night, when once this piece is fairly acted. It costs
us more arrangement than I dreamed of."
"But none of you," exclaimed Philina, "will be happier than I, little as my part disturbs me. Really, to hear a single
subject talked of forever and forever, when after all there is nothing to come of it, beyond an exhibition which
will be forgotten like so many hundred others, this is what I have not patience for. In Heaven's name, not so many
pros and cons! The guests you entertain have always something to object against the dinner; nay, if you could
hear them talk of it at home, they cannot understand how it was possible to undergo so sad a business."
"Let me turn your illustration, pretty one, to my own advantage," answered Wilhelm. "Consider how much must
be done by art and nature, by traffickers and tradesmen, before an entertainment can be given. How many years
the stag must wander in the forest, the fish in the river or the sea, before they can deserve to grace our table! And
what cares and consultations with her cooks and servants has the lady of the house submitted to! Observe with
what indifference the people swallow the production of the distant vintager, the seaman and the vintner, as if it
were a thing of course. And ought these men to cease from labouring, providing and preparing; ought the master
of the house to cease from purchasing and laying up the fruit of their exertions, because at last the enjoyment if
Chapter X

154

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
affords is transitory? But no enjoyment can be transitory; the impression which it leaves is permanent; and what is
done with diligence and effort communicates to the spectator a hidden force, of which we cannot say how far its
influence may reach."
"'Tis all one to me," replied Philina; "only here again I must observe that you men are constantly at variance with
yourselves. With all this conscientious horror at curtailing Shakspeare, you have missed the finest thought there
was in Hamlet!"
"The finest?" cried our friend.
"Certainly the finest," said Philina; "the Prince himself takes pleasure in it."
"And it is?" inquired Serlo.
"If you wore a wig," replied Philina, "I would pluck it very coolly off you; for I think you need to have your
understanding opened."
The rest began to think what she could mean; the conversation paused. The party arose; it was now grown late;
they seemed about to separate. While they were standing, in this undetermined mood, Philina all at once
struck−up a song, with a very graceful, pleasing tune:Sing me not with such emotion How the night so lonesome
is;Pretty maids, I've got a notion It is the reverse of this. For as wife and man are plighted, And the better half the
wife;So is night to day united, Night's the better half of life.Can you joy in bustling daytime, Day when none can
get his will?It is good for work, for haytime, For much other it is ill. But when, in the nightly glooming, Social
lamp on table glows,Face for faces dear illuming, And such jest and joyance goes; When the fiery pert young
fellow, Wont by day to run or ride,Whispering now some tale would tell O, All so gentle by your side; When the
nightingale to lovers Lovingly her songlet sings,Which for exiles and sad rovers Like mere woe and wailing rings:
With a heart how lightsome feeling Do ye count the kindly clock,Which, twelve times deliberate pealing, Tells
you none tonight shall knock! Therefore, on all fit occasions, Mark it, maidens, what I sing:Every day its own
vexations, And the night its joys will bring.
She made a little courtesy on concluding, and Serlo gave a loud "Bravo!" She scuttled off, and left the room with
a teehee of laughter. They heard her singing and skipping as she went down−stairs.
Serlo passed into another room; Wilhelm bade Aurelia good−night; but she continued looking at him for a few
moments, and said:
"How I dislike that woman! dislike her from my heart, and to her very slightest qualities! Those brown eyelashes,
with her fair hair, which our brother thinks so charming, I cannot bear to look at; and that scar upon her brow has
something in it so repulsive, so low and base, that I could recoil ten paces every time I meet her. She was lately
telling as a joke, that her father, when she was a child, threw a plate at her head, of which this is the mark. It is
well that she is marked in the eyes and brow, that those about her may be on their guard."
Wilhelm made no answer, and Aurelia went on, apparently with greater spleen:
"It is next to impossible to speak a friendly or civil word to her, so deeply do I hate her, with all her wheedling.
Would that we were rid of her! And you too, my friend, have a certain complaisance for the creature, a way of
acting towards her, that grieves me to the soul; an attention which borders on respect; which, by Heaven! she does
not merit."
"Whatever she may be," replied our friend, "I owe her thanks. Her upbringing is to blame: to her natural character
I would do justice."
Chapter X

"Character!" exclaimed Aurelia; "and do you think such a creature has a character? O you men! It is so like you!
These are the women you deserve!"
"My friend, can you suspect me?" answered Wilhelm. "I will give account of every minute I have spent beside
her."
"Come, come," replied Aurelia; "it is late, we will not quarrel. All like each, and each like all! Good−night, my
friend! Good−night, my sparkling bird of Paradise!"
Wilhelm asked how he had earned this title.
"Another time," cried she; "another time. They say it has no feet, but hovers in the air, and lives on ather. That,
however, is a story, a poetic fiction. Good−night! Dream sweetly, if you are in luck!"
She proceeded to her room; and he, being left alone, made haste to his.
Half angrily he walked along his chamber to and fro. The jesting but decided tone of Aurelia had hurt him: he felt
deeply how unjust she was. Could he treat Philina with unkindness or ill−nature? She had done no evil to him; but
for any love to her, he could proudly and confidently take his conscience to witness that it was not so.
On the point of beginning to undress, he was going forward to his bed to draw aside the curtains, when, not
without extreme astonishment, he saw a pair of women's slippers lying on the floor before it. One of them was
resting on its sole, the other on its edge. They were Philina's slippers; he recognised them but too well. He thought
he noticed some disorder in the curtains; nay it seemed as if they moved. He stood, and looked with unaverted
eyes.
A new impulse, which he took for anger, cut his breath: after a short pause, he recovered, and cried in a firm tone:
"Come out, Philina! What do you mean by this? Where is your sense, your modesty? Are we to be the speech of
the house tomorrow?"
Nothing stirred.
"I do not jest," continued he; "these pranks are little to my taste."
No sound! No motion!
Irritated and determined, he at last went forward to the bed, and tore the curtains asunder. "Arise," said he, "if I
am not to give you up my room tonight."
With great surprise, he found his bed unoccupied; the sheets and pillows in the sleekest rest. He looked around; he
searched, and searched, but found no traces of the rogue. Behind the bed, the stove, the drawers, there was
nothing to he seen: he sought with great and greater diligence; a spiteful looker−on might have believed that he
was seeking in the hope of finding.
All thought of sleep was gone. He put the slippers on his table: went past it up and down; often paused before it;
and a wicked sprite that watched him has asserted, that our friend employed himself for several hours about these
dainty little shoes; that he viewed them with a certain interest; that he handled them and played with them: and it
was not till towards morning that he threw himself on the bed, without undressing, where he fell asleep amidst a
world of curious fantasies.

Chapter X

156

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
He was still slumbering, when Serlo entered hastily: "Where are you?" cried he; "Still in bed? Impossible! I want
you in the theatre; we have a thousand things to do."

Chapter XI
THE FORENOON and the afternoon fled rapidly away. The playhouse was already full; our friend hastened to
dress. It was not with the joy which it had given him when he first essayed it, that he now put on the garb of
Hamlet: he only dressed himself that he might be in readiness.
On joining the women in the stage−room, they unanimously cried that nothing sat upon him right; the fine feather
stood awry, the buckle of his belt did not fit: they began to slit, to sew, and piece together. The music started:
Philina still objected somewhat to his ruff; Aurelia had much to say against his mantle. "Leave me alone, good
people," cried he, "this negligence will make me like Hamlet." The women would not let him go, but continued
trimming him. The music ceased: the acting was begun. He looked at himself in the glass; pressed his hat closer
down upon his face, and retouched the painting of his cheeks.
At this instant, somebody came rushing in and cried: "The Ghost! The Ghost!"
Wilhelm had not once had time all day to think of the Ghost, and whether it would come or not. His anxiety on
that head was at length removed, and now some strange assistant was to be expected. The stage−manager came in,
inquiring after various matters: Wilhelm had not time to ask about the Ghost; he hastened to present himself
before the throne, where King and Queen, surrounded with their court, were already glancing in all the splendours
of royalty, and waiting till the scene in front of them should be concluded. He caught the last words of Horatio,
who was speaking of the Ghost in extreme confusion, and seemed to have almost forgotten his part.
The intermediate curtain went aloft, and Hamlet saw the crowded house before him. Horatio having spoken his
address, and been dismissed by the King, pressed through to Hamlet; and, as if presenting himself to the Prince,
he said; "The Devil is in harness; he has put us all in fright."
In the mean while two men of large stature, in white cloaks and capuches, were observed standing in the
side−scenes. Our friend, in the distraction, embarrassment and hurry of the moment, had failed in the first
soliloquy; at least such was his own opinion, though loud plaudits had attended his exit. Accordingly he made his
next entrance in no pleasant mood, with the dreary wintry feeling of dramatic condemnation. Yet he girded up his
mind; and spoke that appropriate passage on the "rouse and wassel," the "heavy−headed revel" of the Danes, with
suitable indifference; he had, like the audience, in thinking of it, quite forgotten the Ghost; and he started in real
terror, when Horatio cried out, "Look, my lord, it comes!" He whirled violently round; and the tall noble figure,
the low inaudible tread, the light movement in the heavy−looking armour, made such an impression on him, that
he stood as if transformed to stone, and could utter only in a half−voice his: "Angels and ministers of grace
defend us!" He glared at the form; drew a deep breathing once or twice, and pronounced his address to the Ghost
in a manner so confused, so broken, so constrained, that the highest art could not have hit the mark so well.
His translation of this passage now stood him in goodstead. He had kept very close to the original; in which the
arrangement of the words appeared to him expressive of a mind confounded, terrified and seized with horror:"Be
thou a spirit of health, or goblin damn'd,Bring with thee airs from Heaven or blasts from Hell,Be thy intents
wicked or charitable,Thou com'st in such a questionable shape,That I will speak to thee; I'll call thee
Hamlet,King, father, royal Dane: O answer me!"A deep effect was visible in the audience. The Ghost beckoned,
the Prince followed him amid the loudest plaudits. The scene changed; and when the two had re−appeared, the
Ghost on a sudden stopped, and turned round; by which means Hamlet came to be a little too close upon it. With a
longing curiosity, he looked in at the lowered vizor, but except two deep−lying eyes, and a well−formed nose, he
could discern nothing. Gazing timidly, he stood before the Ghost; but when the first tones issued from the helmet,
Chapter XI

157

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
and a somewhat hoarse yet deep and penetrating voice pronounced the words: "I am thy father's spirit," Wilhelm,
shuddering, started back some paces, and the audience shuddered with him. Each imagined that he knew the
voice; Wilhelm thought he noticed in it some resemblance with his father's. These strange emotions and
remembrances; the curiosity he felt about discovering his secret friend, the anxiety about offending him, even the
theatric impropriety of coming too near him in the present situation, all this affected Wilhelm with powerful and
conflicting impulses. During the long speech of the Ghost, he changed his place so frequently; he seemed so
unsettled and perplexed, so attentive, and so absent−minded, that his acting caused a universal admiration, as the
Spirit caused a universal horror. The latter spoke with a feeling of melancholy anger rather than of sorrow; but of
an anger spiritual, slow and inexhaustible. It was the mistemper of a noble soul, that is severed from all earthly
things, and yet devoted to unbounded woe. At last he vanished; but in a curious manner; for a thin, gray,
transparent gauze arose from the place of descent like a vapour, spread itself over him, and sank along with him.
Hamlet's friends now entered, and swore upon the sword. Old Truepenny, in the mean time, was so busy under
ground, that wherever they might take their station, he was sure to call out right beneath them: "Swear!" and they
started, as if the soil had taken fire below them, and hastened to another spot. On each of these occasions, too, a
little flame pierced through at the place where they were standing. The whole produced on the spectators a
profound impression.
After this, the piece proceeded calmly on its course: nothing failed, all prospered; the audience manifested their
contentment, and the actors seemed to rise in heart and spirits every scene.

Chapter XII
THE CURTAIN fell; and rapturous applauses sounded out of every corner of the house. The four princely corpses
sprang aloft, and embraced each other. Polonius and Ophelia likewise issued from their graves, and listened with
extreme satisfaction, as Horatio, who had stept before the curtain to announce the following piece, was welcomed
with the most thundering plaudits. The people would not hear of any other play, but violently required the
repetition of the present.
"We have won," cried Serlo: "and so not another reasonable word this night! Every thing depends on the first
impression: we should never take it ill of any actor that, on occasion of his first appearance, he is provident and
even self−willed."
The box−keeper came and delivered him a heavy sum. "We have made a good beginning," cried the Manager,
"and prejudice itself will now be on our side. But where is the supper that you promised us? Tonight we may be
allowed to relish it a little."
It had been agreed that all the party were to stay together in their stage−dresses, and enjoy a little feast among
themselves. Wilhelm had engaged to have the place in readiness, and Frau Melina to provide the victuals.
A room, which commonly was occupied by scene−painters, had accordingly been polished up as well as possible;
our friends had hung it round with little decorations; and so decked and trimmed it, that it looked half like a
garden, half like a colonnade. On entering it, the company were dazzled with the glitter of a multitude of lights,
which, across the vapours of the sweetest and most copious perfumes, spread a stately splendour over a
well−decorated and well−furnished table. These preparations were hailed with joyful interjections by the party: all
took their places with a certain genuine dignity; it seemed as if some royal family had met together in the
Kingdom of the Shades. Wilhelm sat between Aurelia and the Frau Melina; Serlo between Philina and Elmira;
nobody was discontented with himself or with his place.
Our two theatric amateurs, who had from the first been present, now increased the pleasure of the meeting. While
Chapter XII

158

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
the exhibition was proceeding, they had several times stept round, and come upon the stage, expressing, in the
warmest terms, the delight which they and the audience felt. They now descended to particulars; and each was
richly rewarded for his efforts.
With boundless animation, the company extolled man after man and passage after passage. To the prompter, who
had modestly sat down at the bottom of the table, they gave a liberal commendation for his rugged Pyrrhus; the
fencing of Hamlet and Laertes was beyond all praise; Ophelia's mourning had been inexpressibly exalted and
affecting; of Polonius they would not trust themselves to speak.
Every individual present heard himself commended through the rest and by them; nor was the absent Ghost
defrauded of his share of praise and admiration. He had played the part, it was asserted, with a very happy voice,
and in a lofty style; but what surprised them most was the information which he seemed to have about their own
affairs. He entirely resembled the painted figure, as if he had sat to the painter of it; and the two amateurs
described, in glowing language, how awful it had looked when the spirit entered near the picture, and stept across
before his own image. Truth and error, they declared, had been commingled in the strangest manner; they had felt
as if the Queen really did not see the Ghost. And Frau Melina was especially commended, because on this
occasion she had gazed upwards at the picture, while Hamlet was pointing downwards at the Spectre.
Inquiry was now made how the apparition could have entered. The stage−manager reported that a back−door,
usually blocked up by decorations, had that evening, as the Gothic hall was occupied, been opened; that two large
figures, in white cloaks and hoods, one of whom was not to be distinguished from the other, had entered by this
passage; and by the same, it was likely, they had issued when the third act was over.
Serlo praised the Ghost for one merit; that he had not whined and lamented like a tailor; nay, to animate his son,
had even introduced a passage at the end, which more beseemed such a hero. Wilhelm had kept it in memory; he
promised to insert it in his manuscript.
Amid the pleasures of the entertainment, it had not been noticed that the children and the Harper were absent. Ere
long they made their entrance, and were blithely welcomed by the company. They came in together, very
strangely decked: Felix was beating a triangle, Mignon a tambourine; the old man had his large harp hung round
his neck, and was playing on it whilst he carried it before him. They marched round and round the table, and sang
a multitude of songs. Eatables were handed them; and the guests seemed to think they could not do a greater
kindness to the children, than by giving them as much sweet wine as they chose to have. For the company
themselves had not by any means neglected a stock of savoury flasks, presented by the two amateurs, which had
arrived that evening in baskets. The children tripped about, and sang; Mignon, in particular, was frolicsome
beyond all wont. She beat the tambourine with the greatest liveliness and grace; now, with her finger pressed
against the parchment, she hummed across it swiftly to and fro; now rattled on it with her knuckles, now with the
back of her hand; nay sometimes, with alternating rhythm, she struck it first against her knee and then against her
head; and anon twirling it in her hand, she made the shells jingle by themselves; and thus, from the simplest
instrument, elicited a great variety of tones. After she and Felix had long rioted about, they sat down upon an
elbow−chair which was standing empty at the table, exactly opposite to Wilhelm.
"Keep out of the chair!" cried Serlo: "it is waiting for the Ghost, I think; and when he comes, it will be worse for
you."
"I do not fear him," answered Mignon: "if he comes, we can rise. He is my uncle, and will not harm me." To those
who did not know that her reputed father had been named the Great Devil, this speech was unintelligible.
The party looked at one another; they were more and more confirmed in their suspicion that the Manager was in
the secret of the Ghost. They talked and tippled, and the girls from time to time cast timid glances towards the
door.
Chapter XII

159

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
The children, who, sitting in the great chair, looked from over the table but like puppets in their box, did actually
at length start a little drama in the style of Punch. The screeching tone of these people Mignon imitated very well;
and Felix and she began to knock their heads together, and against the edges of the table, in such a way as only
wooden puppets could endure. Mignon, in particular, grew frantic with gaiety; the company, much as they had
laughed at her at first, were in fine obliged to curb her. But persuasion was of small avail; for she now sprang up,
and raved and shook her tambourine, and capered round the table. With her hair flying out behind her, with her
head thrown back, and her limbs as it were cast into the air, she seemed like one of those antique Manads, whose
wild and all but impossible positions still, on classic monuments, often strike us with amazement.
Incited by the talents and the uproar of the children, each endeavoured to contribute something to the
entertainment of the night. The girls sang several canons; Laertes whistled in the manner of a nightingale; and the
Pedant gave a symphony pianissimo upon the Jew's−harp. Meanwhile the youths and damsels, who sat near each
other, had begun a great variety of games; in which, as the hands often crossed and met, some pairs were favoured
with a transient squeeze, the emblem of a hopeful kindness. Madam Melina in particular seemed scarcely to
conceal a decided tenderness for Wilhelm. It was late; and Aurelia, perhaps the only one retaining self−possession
in the party, now stood up, and signified that it was time to go.
By way of termination, Serlo gave a firework, or what resembled one; for the sound of crackers, rockets and
firewheels with his mouth, in a style of nearly inconceivable correctness. You had only to shut your eyes, and the
deception was complete. In the mean time, they had all risen; the men gave their arms to the women to escort
them home. Wilhelm was walking last with Aurelia. The stage−manager met him on the stairs, and said to him:
"Here is the veil our Ghost vanished in: it was hanging fixed to the place where he sank; we found it this
moment."
"A curious relic!" said our friend, and took it with him.
At this instant his left arm was laid hold of, and he felt a smart twinge of pain in it. Mignon had hid herself in the
place; she had seized him, and bit his arm. She rushed past him, down−stairs, and disappeared.
On reaching the open air, almost all of them discovered that they had drunk too liberally. They glided asunder
without taking leave.
The instant Wilhelm gained his room, he stripped, and extinguishing his candle, hastened into bed. Sleep was
overpowering him without delay, when a noise, that seemed to issue from behind the stove, aroused him. In the
eye of his heated fancy, the image of the harnessed King was hovering there; he sat up that he might address the
Spectre; but he felt himself encircled with soft arms, and his mouth was shut with kisses, which he had not force
to push away.

Chapter XIII
NEXT morning, Wilhelm started up with an unpleasant feeling, and found himself alone. His head was still dim
with the tumult, which he had not yet entirely slept off; and the recollection of his nightly visitant disquieted his
mind. His first suspicion lighted on Philina; but, on second thoughts, he conceived that it could not have been she.
He sprang out of bed, and, while putting on his clothes, he noticed that the door, which commonly he used to bolt,
was now ajar; though whether he had shut it on the previous night or not, he could not recollect.
But what surprised him most was the Spirit's veil, which he found lying on his bed. Having brought it up with
him, he had most probably thrown it there himself. It was a gray gauze; on the hem of it he noticed an inscription
broidered in dark letters. He unfolded it, and read the words: "FOR THE FIRST AND THE LAST TIME! FLY,
YOUTH! FLY!" He was struck with it, and knew not what to think or say.
Chapter XIII

160

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
At this moment Mignon entered with his breakfast. The aspect of the child astonished Wilhelm, we may almost
say frightened him. She appeared to have grown taller overnight: she entered with a stately, noble air; and looked
him in the face so earnestly, that he could not endure her glances. She did not touch him, as at other times, when,
for morning salutation, she would press his hand, or kiss his cheek, his lips, his arm, or shoulder; but having put
his things in order, she retired in silence.
The appointed time of a first−rehearsal now arrived: our friends assembled, all of them entirely out of tune from
yesternight's debauch. Wilhelm roused himself as much as possible, that he might not at the very outset violate the
principles of diligence, which he had preached so lately with such emphasis. His practice in the matter helped him
through: for practice and habit must, in every art, fill up the voids, which genius and temper in their fluctuations
will so often leave.
But in the present case, our friend had especial reason to admit the truth of the remark, that no one should begin
with a festivity any situation that is meant to last, particularly that is meant to be a trade, a mode of living.
Festivities are fit for what is happily concluded: at the commencement, they but waste the force and zeal which
should inspire us in the struggle, and support us through a long−continued labour. Of all festivities, the
marriage−festival appears the most unsuitable: calmness, humility and silent hope befit no ceremony more than
this.
So passed the day, which to Wilhelm seemed the most insipid he had ever spent. Instead of their accustomed
conversation in the evening, the company began to yawn: the interest of Hamlet was exhausted; they rather felt it
disagreeable than otherwise that the piece was to be given again next night. Wilhelm showed the evil which the
Royal Dane had left; it was to be inferred from this, that he would not come again. Serlo was of that opinion; he
appeared to be deep in the secrets of the Ghost; but, on the other hand, the inscription, "Fly, youth! Fly!" seemed
inconsistent with the rest. How could Serlo be in league with any one whose aim it was to take away the finest
actor of his troop?
It had now become a matter of necessity to confer on Boisterous the Ghost's part, and on the Pedant that of the
King. Both declared that they had studied these sufficiently: nor was it wonderful; for, in such a number of
rehearsals, and so copious a treatment of the subject, all of them had grown familiar with it; each could have
exchanged his part with any other. Yet they rehearsed a little here and there, and prepared the new adventurers as
fully as the hurry would admit. When the company was breaking up at a pretty late hour, Philina softly whispered
Wilhelm as she passed: "I must have my slippers back: thou wilt not bolt the door?" These words excited some
perplexity in Wilhelm, when he reached his chamber: they strengthened the suspicion that Philina was the secret
visitant: and we ourselves are forced to coincide with this idea; particularly as the causes, which awakened in our
friend another and a stranger supposition, cannot be disclosed. He kept walking up and down his chamber, in no
quiet frame: his door was actually not yet bolted.
On a sudden, Mignon rushed into the room; laid hold of him, and cried: "Master! save the house! It is on fire!"
Wilhelm sprang through the door; and a strong smoke came rushing down upon him from the upper story. On the
street he heard the cry of fire; and the Harper, with his instrument in his hand, came down−stairs breathless
through the smoke. Aurelia hurried out of her chamber, and threw little Felix into Wilhelm's arms.
"Save the child!" cried she; "and we will mind the rest."
Wilhelm did not look upon the danger as so great; his first thought was to penetrate to the source of the fire, and
try to stifle it before it reached a head. He gave Felix to the Harper; commanding him to hasten down the stone
stairs, which led across a little garden−vault out into the garden, and to wait with the children in the open air.
Mignon took a light to show the way. He begged Aurelia to secure her things there also. He himself pierced
upwards through the smoke; but it was in vain that he exposed himself to such danger. The flame appeared to
issue from a neighbouring house; it had already caught the wooden floor and staircase: some others, who had
Chapter XIII

161

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
hastened to his help, were suffering like himself from fire and vapour. Yet he kept inciting them; he called for
water; he conjured them to dispute every inch with the flame; and promised to abide by them to the last. At this
instant, Mignon came springing up, and cried: "Master! save thy Felix! The old man is mad! He is killing him."
Scarcely knowing what he did, Wilhelm darted down−stairs, and Mignon followed close behind him.
On the last steps, which led into the garden−vault, he paused with horror. Some heaps of fire−wood branches, and
large masses of straw, which had been stowed in the place, were burning with a clear flame; Felix was lying on
the ground and screaming; the Harper stood aside holding down his head, and leaned against the wall. "Unhappy
creature! what is this?" said Wilhelm. The old man spoke not; Mignon lifted Felix, and carried him with difficulty
to the garden; while Wilhelm strove to pull the fire asunder and extinguish it; but only by his efforts made the
flame more violent. At last he too was forced to fly into the garden, with his hair and his eyelashes burnt; tearing
the Harper with him through the conflagration, who, with singed beard, unwillingly, accompanied him.
Wilhelm hastened instantly to seek the children. He found them on the threshold of a summer−house at some
distance: Mignon was trying every effort to pacify her comrade. Wilhelm took him on his knee; he questioned
him, felt him; but could obtain no satisfactory account from either him or Mignon.
Meanwhile the fire had fiercely seized on several houses; it was now enlightening all the neighbourhood. Wilhelm
looked at the child in the red glare of the flames; he could find no wound, no blood, no hurt of any kind. He
groped over all the little creature's body; but it gave no sign of pain; on the contrary, it by degrees grew calm, and
began to wonder at the blazing houses, and express its pleasure at the spectacle of beams and rafters burning all in
order, like a grand illumination, so beautifully there.
Wilhelm thought not of the clothes or goods he might have lost; he felt deeply how inestimable to him was this
pair of human beings, who had just escaped so great a danger. He pressed little Felix to his heart with a new
emotion; Mignon too he was about to clasp with joyful tenderness, but she softly avoided this; she took him by
the hand and held it fast.
"Master," said she,−(till the present evening she had hardly ever named him master; at first she used to name him
sir, and afterwards to call him father)−"Master! we have escaped an awful danger; thy Felix was on the point of
death."
By many inquiries, Wilhelm learned from her at last, that when they came into the vault, the Harper tore the light
from her hand, and set on fire the straw. That he then put Felix down; laid his hands with strange gestures on the
head of the child, and drew a knife as if he meant to sacrifice him. That she sprang forward, and snatched it from
him; that she screamed, and some one from the house, who was carrying something down into the garden, came
to her help, but must have gone away again in the confusion, and left the old man and the child alone.
Two or even three houses were now flaming in a general blaze. Owing to the conflagration in the vault, no person
had been able to take shelter in the garden. Wilhelm was distressed about his friends, and in a less degree about
his property. Not venturing to quit the children, he was forced to sit, and see the mischief spreading more and
more.
In this anxious state he passed some hours. Felix had fallen asleep on his bosom; Mignon was lying at his side,
and holding fast his hand. The efforts of the people finally subdued the fire. The burnt houses sank, with
successive crashes, into heaps; the morning was advancing; the children awoke, and complained of bitter cold;
even Wilhelm in his light dress could scarcely brook the chillness of the falling dew. He took the young ones to
the rubbish of the prostrate building; where, among the ashes and the embers, they found a very grateful warmth.
The opening day collected, by degrees, the various individuals of the party. All of them had got away unhurt, no
one had lost much. Wilhelm's trunk was saved among the rest.
Chapter XIII

162

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Towards ten o'clock, Serlo called them to rehearse their Hamlet, at least some scenes of the piece, in which fresh
players were to act. He had some debates to manage, on this point, with the municipal authorities. The clergy
required, that after such a visitation of Providence, the playhouse should be shut for some time; and Serlo on the
other hand maintained that, both for the purpose of repairing the damage he had suffered, and of exhilarating the
depressed and terrified spirits of the people, nothing could be more in place than the exhibition of some
interesting piece. His opinion in the end prevailed; and the house was full. The actors played with singular fire,
with more of a passionate freedom than at first. The feelings of the audience had been heightened by the horrors
of the previous night, and their appetite for entertainment had been sharpened by the tedium of a wasted and
dissipated day; every one had more than usual susceptibility for what was strange and moving. Most of them were
new spectators, invited by the fame of the piece; they could not compare the present with the preceding evening.
Boisterous played altogether in the style of the unknown Ghost; the Pedant too had accurately seized the manner
of his predecessor; nor was his own woful aspect without its use to him; for it seemed as if, in spite of his purple
cloak and his ermine collar, Hamlet were fully justified in calling him a "king of shreds and patches."
Few have ever reached the throne by a path more singular than his had been. But although the rest, and especially
Philina, made sport of his preferment, he himself signified that the Count, a consummate judge, had at the first
glance predicted this and much more of him. Philina, on the other hand, recommended lowliness of mind to him;
saying she would now and then powder the sleeves of his coat, that he might remember that unhappy night in the
Castle, and wear his crown with meekness.

Chapter XIV
OUR friends had sought out other lodgings, on the spur of the moment, and were by this means much dispersed.
Wilhelm had conceived a liking for the garden−house, where he had spent the night of the conflagration: he easily
obtained the key, and settled himself there. But Aurelia being greatly hampered in her new abode, he was obliged
to retain little Felix with him. Mignon, indeed, would not part with the boy.
He had placed the children in a neat chamber on the upper floor: he himself was in the lower parlour. The young
ones were asleep at this time: Wilhelm could not sleep.
Adjoining the lovely garden, which the full moon had just risen to illuminate, the black ruins of the fire were
visible, and here and there a streak of vapour was still mounting from them. The air was soft, the night extremely
beautiful. Philina in issuing from the theatre had jogged him with her elbow, and whispered something to him,
which he did not understand. He felt perplexed and out of humour: he knew not what he should expect or do. For
a day or two Philina had avoided him: it was not till tonight that she had given him any second signal. Unhappily
the doors, that he was not to bolt, were now consumed; the slippers had evaporated into smoke. How the girl
would gain admission to the garden, if her aim was such, he knew not. He wished she might not come; and yet he
longed to have some explanation with her.
But what lay heavier at his heart than this, was the fate of the Harper, whom, since the fire, no one had seen.
Wilhelm was afraid that, in clearing off the rubbish, they would find him buried under it. Our friend had carefully
concealed the suspicion which he entertained, that it was the Harper who had fired the house. The old man had
been first seen, as he rushed from the burning and smoking floor; and his desperation in the vault appeared a
natural consequence of such a deed. Yet, from the inquiry which the magistrates had instituted touching the affair,
it seemed likely that the fire had not originated in the house where Wilhelm lived, but had accidentally been
kindled in the third from that, and had crept along, beneath the roofs, before it burst into activity.
Seated in a grove, our friend was meditating all these things, when he heard a low footfall in a neighbouring walk.
By the melancholy song which arose along with it, he recognised the Harper. He caught the words of the song
without difficulty: it turned on the consolations of a miserable man, conscious of being on the borders of insanity.
Chapter XIV

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Unhappily our friend forgot the whole of it except the last verse:Wheresoe'er my steps may lead me, Meekly at
the door I'll stay;Pious hands will come to feed me, And I'll wander on my way.Each will feel a touch of gladness,
When my aged form appears;Each will shed a tear of sadness, Though I reck not of his tears.
So singing, he had reached the garden−door, which led into an unfrequented street. Finding it bolted, he was
making an attempt to climb the railing, when Wilhelm held him back, and addressed some kindly words to him.
The old man begged to have the door unlocked, declaring that he would and must escape. Wilhelm represented to
him, that he might indeed escape from the garden, but could not from the town; showing, at the same time, what
suspicions he must needs incur by such a step. But it was in vain: the old man held by his opinion. Our friend,
however, would not yield; and at last he brought him, half by force, into the garden−house, in which he locked
himself along with him. The two carried on a strange conversation; which, however, not to afflict our readers with
repeating unconnected thoughts and dolorous emotions, we had rather pass in silence than detail at large.

Chapter XV
UNDETERMINED what to do with this unhappy man, who displayed such indubitable symptoms of madness,
Wilhelm would have been in great perplexity, had not Laertes come that very morning, and delivered him from
his uncertainty. Laertes, as usual, rambling everywhere about the town, had happened, in some coffee−house, to
meet with a man who, a short time ago, had suffered under violent attacks of melancholy. This person, it
appeared, had been intrusted to the care of some country clergyman, who made it his peculiar business to attend to
people in such situations. In the present instance, as in many others, his treatment had succeeded: he was still in
town; and the friends of the patient were showing him the greatest honour.
Wilhelm hastened to find out this person: he disclosed the case to him, and agreed with him about the terms. The
Harper was to be brought over to him, under certain pretexts. The separation deeply pained our friend; so used
was he to see the man beside him, and to hear his spirited and touching strains. The hope of soon beholding him
recovered, served in some degree to moderate this feeling. The old man's harp had been destroyed in the burning
of the house: they purchased him another, and gave it him when he departed.
Mignon's little wardrobe had in like manner been consumed. As Wilhelm was about providing her with new
apparel, Aurelia proposed that now at last they should dress her as a girl.
"No! no! not at all!" cried Mignon; and insisted on it with such earnestness, that they let her have her way.
The company had not much leisure for reflection: the exhibitions followed close on one another.
Wilhelm often mingled with the audience, to ascertain their feelings; but he seldom heard a criticism of the kind
he wished; more frequently the observations which he listened to distressed or angered him. Thus, for instance,
shortly after Hamlet had been acted for the first time, a youth was telling, with considerable animation, how
happy he had been that evening in the play−house. Wilhelm hearkened; and was scandalised to learn that his
neighbour had, on that occasion, in contempt of those behind him, kept his hat on, stubbornly refusing to remove
it till the piece was done; to which heroical transaction he still looked back with great contentment.
Another gentleman declared that Wilhelm played Laertes very well; but that the actor who had undertaken Hamlet
did not seem too happy in his part. This permutation was not quite unnatural; for Wilhelm and Laertes did
resemble one another, though in a very distant manner.
A third critic warmly praised his acting, particularly in the scene with his mother; only he regretted much, that in
this fiery moment a white strap had peered out from below the Prince's waistcoat, whereby the illusion had been
greatly marred.
Chapter XV

Meanwhile, in the interior of the company, a multitude of alterations were occurring. Philina, since the evening
subsequent to that of the fire, had never given our friend the smallest sign of closer intimacy. She had, as it
seemed on purpose, hired a remote lodging; she associated with Elmira, and came seldomer to Serlo, an
arrangement very gratifying to Aurelia. Serlo continued still to like her; and often visited her quarters, particularly
when he hoped to find Elmira there. One evening he took Wilhelm with him. At their entrance, both of them were
much surprised to see Philina, in the inner room, sitting in close contact with a young officer. He wore a red
uniform with white pantaloons; but his face being turned away, they could not see it. Philina came into the outer
room to meet her visitors, and shut the door behind her. "You surprise me in the middle of a very strange
adventure," cried she.
"It does not appear so strange," said Serlo: "but let us see this handsome, young, enviable gallant. You have us in
such training, that we dare not show any jealousy, however it may be."
"I must leave you to suspicion for a time," replied Philina, in a jesting tone; "yet I can assure you, the gallant is a
lady of my friends, who wishes to remain a few days undiscovered. You shall know her history in due season;
nay, perhaps you shall even behold the beautiful spinster in person; and then most probably I shall have need of
all my prudence and discretion, for it seems too likely that your new acquaintance will drive your old friend out of
favour."
Wilhelm stood as if transformed to stone. At the first glance, the red uniform had reminded him of Mariana; the
figure too was hers, the fair hair was hers; only the present individual seemed to be a little taller.
"For Heaven's sake," cried he, "let us know something more about your friend; let us see this lady in disguise! We
are now partakers of your secret: we will promise, we will swear; only let us see the lady!"
"What a fire he is in!" cried Philina: "but be cool, be calm; for today there will nothing come of it."
"Let us only know her name!" cried Wilhelm.
"It were a fine secret then," replied Philina.
"At least her first name!"
"If you can guess it, be it so. Three guesses I will give you; not a fourth. You might lead me through the whole
calendar."
"Well!" said Wilhelm, "Cecilia, then?"
"None of your Cecilias!"
"Henrietta?"
"Not at all! Have a care, I pray you; guess better, or your curiosity will have to sleep unsatisfied."
Wilhelm paused and shivered: he tried to speak, but the sound died away within him. "Mariana?" stammered he at
last, "Mariana!"
"Bravo!" cried Philina. "Hit to a hair's−breadth!" said she, whirling round upon her heel, as she was wont on such
occasions.
Wilhelm could not utter a word; and Serlo, not observing his emotion, urged Philina more and more to let them in.
Chapter XV

165

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Conceive the astonishment of both, when Wilhelm, suddenly and vehemently interrupting their raillery, threw
himself at Philina's feet, and with an air and tone of the deepest passion begged and conjured her: "Let me see the
stranger," cried he; "she is mine; she is my Mariana! She, for whom I have longed all the days of my life; she,
who is still more to me than all the women in this world! Go in to her at least, and tell her that I am here; that the
man is here who linked to her his earliest love, and all the happiness of his youth. Say that he will justify himself,
though he left her so unkindly; he will pray for pardon of her; and will grant her pardon, whatsoever she may have
done to him; he will even make no pretensions farther, if he may but see her, if he may but see that she is living
and in happiness."
Philina shook her head, and said: "Speak low! Do not betray us! If the lady is indeed your friend, her feelings
must be spared; for she does not in the least suspect that you are here. Quite a different sort of business brings her
hither: and you know well enough, one had rather see a spectre than a former lover, at an inconvenient time. I will
ask her, and prepare her; we will then consider what is farther to be done. Tomorrow I shall write you a note,
saying when you are to come, or whether you may come at all. Obey me punctually; for I protest that, without her
own and my consent, no eye shall see this lovely creature. I shall keep my doors better bolted; and with axe and
crow you surely will not visit me."
Our friend conjured her, Serlo begged of her; but all in vain: they were obliged to yield, and leave the chamber
and the house.
With what feelings Wilhelm passed the night is easy to conceive. How slowly the hours of the day flowed on,
while he sat expecting a message from Philina, may also be imagined. Unhappily he had to play that evening:
such mental pain he had never endured. The moment his part was done, he hastened to Philina's house, without
inquiring whether he had got her leave or not. He found her doors bolted: and the people of the house informed
him that Mademoiselle had set out early in the morning, in company with a young officer; that she had talked
about returning shortly; but they had not believed her, she having paid her debts, and taken everything along with
her.
This intelligence drove Wilhelm almost frantic. He hastened to Laertes, that he might take measures for pursuing
her, and, cost what it would, for attaining certainty regarding her attendant. Laertes, however, represented to him
the imprudence of such passion and credulity. "I dare wager, after all," said he, "that it is no one else but
Friedrich. The boy is of a high family, I know; he is madly in love with Philina; it is likely he has cozened from
his friends a fresh supply of money, so that he can once more live with her in peace for a while."
These considerations, though they did not quite convince our friend, sufficed to make him waver. Laertes showed
him how improbable the story was, with which Philina had amused them; reminded him how well the stranger's
hair and figure answered Friedrich; that with the start of him by twelve hours, they could not easily be overtaken;
and what was more than all, that Serlo could not do without him at the theatre.
By so many reasons, Wilhelm was at last persuaded to postpone the execution of his project. That night Laertes
got an active man, to whom they gave the charge of following the runaways. It was a steady person, who had
often officiated as courier and guide to travelling parties, and was at present without employment. They gave him
money, they informed him of the whole affair; instructing him to seek and overtake the fugitives, to keep them in
his eye, and instantly to send intelligence to Wilhelm, where and how he found them. That very hour he mounted
horse, pursuing this ambiguous pair; by which exertions Wilhelm was, in some degree at least, composed.

Chapter XVI
THE DEPARTURE of Philina did not make a deep sensation, either in the theatre or in the public. She never was
in earnest with anything: the women universally detested her; the men rather wished to see her tête−à−tête than on
Chapter XVI

166

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
the boards. Thus her fine, and for the stage even happy talents were of no avail to her. The other members of the
company took greater labour on them to supply her place: the Frau Melina, in particular, was much distinguished
by her diligence and zeal. She noted down, as formerly, the principles of Wilhelm; she guided herself according to
his theory and his example; there was of late a something in her nature that rendered her more interesting. She
soon acquired an accurate mode of playing; she attained the natural tone of conversation altogether, that of keen
emotion she attained in some degree. She contrived, moreover, to adapt herself to Serlo's humours; she took pains
in singing for his pleasure, and succeeded in that matter moderately well.
By the accession of some other players, the company was rendered more complete: and while Wilhelm and Serlo
were busied each in his degree, the former insisting on the general tone and spirit of the whole, the latter faithfully
elaborating the separate passages, a laudable ardour likewise inspired the actors, and the public took a lively
interest in their concerns.
"We are on the right path," said Serlo once; "if we can continue thus, the public too will soon be on it. Men are
easily astonished and misled by wild and barbarous exhibitions; yet lay before them anything rational and
polished, in an interesting manner, and doubt not they will catch at it.
"What forms the chief defect of our German theatre, what prevents both actor and spectator from obtaining proper
views, is the vague and variegated nature of the objects it contains. You nowhere find a barrier, on which to prop
your judgment. In my opinion, it is far from an advantage to us, that we have expanded our stage into as it were a
boundless arena for the whole of nature: yet neither manager nor actor need attempt contracting it, until the taste
of the nation shall itself mark out the proper circle. Every good society submits to certain conditions and
restrictions; so also must every good theatre. Certain manners, certain modes of speech, certain objects and
fashions of proceeding, must altogether be excluded. You do not grow poorer by limiting your household
expenditure."
On these points our friends were more or less accordant or at variance. The majority, with Wilhelm at their head,
were for the English theatre; Serlo and a few others for the French.
It was also settled, that in vacant hours, of which unhappily an actor has too many, they should in company peruse
the finest plays in both these languages; examining what parts of them seemed best and worthiest of imitation.
They accordingly commenced with some French pieces. On these occasions, it was soon observed, Aurelia went
away whenever they began to read. At first they supposed she had been sick: Wilhelm once questioned her about
it.
"I would not assist at such a reading," said she: "for how could I hear and judge, when my heart was torn in
pieces? I hate the French language from the bottom of my soul."
"How can you be hostile to a language," cried our friend, "to which we Germans are indebted for the greater part
of our accomplishments; to which we must become indebted still more, if our natural qualities are ever to assume
their proper form?"
"It is no prejudice!" replied Aurelia: "a painful impression, a hated recollection of my faithless friend, has robbed
me of all enjoyment in that beautiful and cultivated tongue. How I hate it now, with my whole strength and heart!
During the period of our kindliest connexion, he wrote in German, and what genuine, powerful, cordial German!
It was not till he wanted to get quit of me, that he began seriously to write in French. I marked, I felt what he
meant. What he would have blushed to utter in his mother−tongue, he could by this means write with a quiet
conscience. It is the language of reservations, equivocations and lies: it is a perfidious language. Heaven be
praised! I cannot find another word to express this perfide of theirs in all its compass. Our poor treulos, the
faithless of the English, are innocent as babes beside it. Perfide means faithless with pleasure, with insolence and
malice. How enviable is the culture of a nation that can figure out so many shades of meaning by a single word!
Chapter XVI

167

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
French is exactly the language of the world; worthy to become the universal language, that all may have it in their
power to cheat, and cozen, and betray each other! His French letters were always smooth and pleasant, while you
read them. If you chose to believe it, they sounded warmly, even passionately: but if you examined narrowly, they
were but phrases, accursed phrases! He has spoiled my feeling to the whole language, to French literature, even to
the beautiful delicious expressions of noble souls which may be found in it. I shudder when a French word is
spoken in my hearing."
In such terms, she could for hours continue to give utterance to her chagrin, interrupting or disturbing every other
kind of conversation. Sooner or later, Serlo used to put an end to such peevish lamentations by some bitter sally;
but, by this means, commonly the talk for the evening was destroyed.
In all provinces of life, it is unhappily the case, that whatever is to be accomplished by a number of coöperating
men and circumstances, cannot long continue perfect. Of an acting company as well as of a kingdom, of a circle
of friends as well as of an army, you may commonly select the moment when it may be said that all was standing
on the highest pinnacle of harmony, perfection, contentment and activity. But alterations will ere long occur: the
individuals that compose the body often change; new members are added; the persons are no longer suited to the
circumstances, or the circumstances to the persons; what was formerly united, quickly falls asunder. Thus it was
with Serlo's company. For a time, you might have called it as complete as any German company could ever boast
of being. Most of the actors were occupying their proper places; all had enough to do, and all did it willingly.
Their private personal condition was not bad; and each appeared to promise great things in his art, for each
commenced with animation and alacrity. But it soon became apparent that a part of them were mere automatons,
who could not reach beyond what was attainable without the aid of feeling. Nor was it long till grudgings and
envyings arose among them, such as commonly obstruct every good arrangement, and easily distort and tear in
pieces everything that reasonable and thinking men would wish to keep united.
The departure of Philina was not quite so insignificant as it had at first appeared. She had always skilfully
contrived to entertain the Manager, and keep the others in good humour. She had endured Aurelia's violence with
amazing patience; and her dearest task had been to flatter Wilhelm. Thus she was, in some respects, a bond of
union for the whole: the loss of her was quickly felt.
Serlo could not live without some little passion of the love sort. Elmira was of late grown up, we might almost say
grown beautiful: for some time she had been attracting his attention, and Philina, with her usual dexterity, had
favoured this attachment so soon as she observed it. "We should train ourselves in time," she would say, "to the
business of procuress; nothing else remains for us when we are old."
Serlo and Elmira had by this means so approximated to each other, that, shortly after the departure of Philina,
both were of a mind; and their small romance was rendered doubly interesting, as they had to hide it sedulously
from the father; Old Boisterous not understanding jokes of that description. Elmira's sister had been admitted to
the secret: and Serlo was in consequence obliged to overlook a multitude of things in both of them. One of their
worst habits was an excessive love of junketing, nay, if you will, an in−intolerable gluttony. In this respect they
altogether differed from Philina, to whom it gave a new tint of loveliness, that she seemed as it were to live on air;
eating very little; and for drink, merely skimming off, with all imaginable grace, the foam from a glass of
champagne.
Now, however, Serlo, if he meant to please his doxies, was obliged to join breakfast with dinner; and with this, by
a substantial bever, to connect the supper. But amid gormandising, Serlo entertained another plan, which he
longed to have fulfilled. He imagined that he saw a kind of inclination between Wilhelm and Aurelia; and he
anxiously wished that it might assume a serious shape. He hoped to cast the whole mechanical department of his
theatrical economy on Wilhelm's shoulders; to find in him, as in the former brother, a faithful and industrious tool.
Already he had, by degrees, shifted over to him most of the cares of management: Aurelia kept the strong−box;
and Serlo once more lived as he had done of old, entirely according to his humour. Yet there was a circumstance
Chapter XVI

168

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
which vexed him in secret, as it did his sister likewise.
The world has a particular way of acting towards public persons of acknowledged merit: it gradually begins to be
indifferent to them; and to favour talents which are new, though far inferior; it makes excessive requisitions of the
former, and accepts of anything with approbation from the latter.
Serlo and Aurelia had opportunity enough to meditate on this peculiarity. The strangers, especially the young and
handsome ones, had drawn the whole attention and applause upon themselves; and Serlo and his sister, in spite of
the most zealous efforts, had in general to make their exits without the welcome sound of clapping hands. It is
true, some special causes were at work on this occasion. Aurelia's pride was palpable, and her contempt for the
public was known to many. Serlo indeed flattered every individual; but his cutting gibes against the whole were
often circulated and repeated. The new members again were not only strangers, unknown and wanting help, but
some of them were likewise young and amiable; thus all of them found patrons.
Ere long, too, there arose internal discontents, and many bickerings among the actors. Scarcely had they noticed
that our friend was acting as director, when most of them began to grow the more remiss, the more he strove to
introduce a better order, greater accuracy, and chiefly to insist that everything mechanical should be performed in
the most strict and regular manner.
Thus, by and by, the whole concern, which actually for a time had nearly looked ideal, grew as vulgar in its
attributes as any mere itinerating theatre. And unhappily, just as Wilhelm, by his labour, diligence and vigorous
efforts, had made himself acquainted with the requisitions of the art, and trained completely both his person and
his habits to comply with them, he began to feel, in melancholy hours, that this craft deserved the necessary
outlay of time and talents less than any other. The task was burdensome, the recompense was small. He would
rather have engaged with any occupation in which, when the period of exertion is past, one can enjoy repose of
mind, than with this, wherein, after undergoing much mechanical drudgery, the aim of one's activity cannot still
be attained but by the strongest effort of thought and emotion. Besides, he had to listen to Aurelia's complaints
about her brother's wastefulness; he had to misconceive the winks and nods of Serlo, trying from afar to lead him
to a marriage with Aurelia. He had withal to hide his own secret sorrow, which pressed heavy on his heart,
because of that ambiguous officer, whom he had sent in quest of. The messenger returned not, sent no tidings; and
Wilhelm feared that his Mariana was lost to him a second time.
About this period, there occurred a public mourning, which obliged our friends to shut their theatre for several
weeks. Wilhelm seized this opportunity to pay a visit to the Clergyman, with whom the Harper had been placed to
board. He found him in a pleasant district; and the first thing that he noticed in the parsonage, was the old man
teaching a boy to play upon his instrument. The Harper showed no little joy at sight of Wilhelm; he rose, held out
his hand, and said:
"You see, I am still good for something in the world; permit me to continue; for my hours are all distributed, and
full of business."
The Clergyman saluted Wilhelm very kindly; and told him that the Harper promised well, already giving hopes of
a complete recovery.
Their conversation naturally turned upon the various modes of treating the insane.
"Except physical derangements," observed the Clergyman, "which often place insuperable difficulties in the way,
and in regard to which I follow the prescriptions of a wise physician, the means of curing madness seem to me
extremely simple. They are the very means by which you hinder sane persons from becoming mad. Awaken their
activity; accustom them to order; bring them to perceive that they hold their being and their fate in common with
many millions; that extraordinary talents, the highest happiness, the deepest misery, are but slight variations from
Chapter XVI

169

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
the general lot: in this way, no insanity will enter; or, if it has entered, will gradually disappear. I have portioned
out the old man's hours; he gives lessons to some children on the harp; he works in the garden; he is already much
more cheerful. He wishes to enjoy the cabbages he plants; my son, to whom in case of death he has bequeathed
his harp, he is ardent to instruct, that the boy may be able to make use of his inheritance. I have said but little to
him, as a clergyman, about his wild mysterious scruples; but a busy life brings on so many incidents, that ere long
he must feel how true it is, that doubt of any kind can be removed by nothing but activity. I go softly to work; yet
if I could get his beard and hood removed, I should reckon it a weighty point; for nothing more exposes us to
madness, than distinguishing ourselves from others, and nothing more contributes to maintain our common sense,
than living in the universal way with multitudes of men. Alas! how much there is in education, in our social
institutions, to prepare us and our children for insanity!"
Wilhelm stayed some days with this intelligent divine; heard from him many curious narratives, not of the insane
alone, but of persons such as commonly are reckoned wise and rational, though they may have peculiarities which
border on insanity.
The conversation became doubly animated on the entrance of the Doctor, with whom it was a custom to pay
frequent visits to his friend the Clergyman, and to assist him in his labours of humanity. The physician was an
oldish man, who, though in weak health, had spent many years in the practice of the noblest virtues. He was a
strong advocate for country life, being himself scarcely able to exist except in the open air. Withal he was
extremely active and companionable. For several years, he had shown a special inclination to make friends with
all the country clergymen within his reach. Such of these as were employed in any useful occupation, he strove by
every means to help; into others, who were still unsettled in their aims, he endeavoured to infuse a taste for some
profitable species of exertion. Being at the same time in connexion with a multitude of noblemen, magistrates,
judges, he had in the space of twenty years, in secret, accomplished much towards the advancement of many
branches of husbandry; he had done his best to put in motion every project that seemed capable of benefiting
agriculture, animals or men; and had thus forwarded improvement in its truest sense. "For man," he used to say,
"there is but one misfortune; when some idea lays hold of him, which exerts no influence upon active life, or still
more, which withdraws him from it. At the present time," continued he on this occasion, "I have such a case
before me; it concerns a rich and noble couple; and hitherto has baffled all my skill. The affair belongs in part to
your department, worthy Pastor, and your friend here will forbear to mention it again.
"In the absence of a certain nobleman, some persons of the house, in a frolic not entirely commendable, disguised
a young man in the master's clothes. The lady was to be imposed upon by this deception; and although it was
described to me as nothing but a joke, I am much afraid the purpose of it was to lead this noble and most amiable
lady from the path of honour. Her husband, however, unexpectedly returns; he enters his chamber; thinks he sees
his spirit; and from that time falls into a melancholy temper, firmly believing that his death is near.
"He has now abandoned himself to men who pamper him with religious ideas; and I see not how he is to be
prevented from going among the Herrnhuthers with his lady; and as he has no children, from depriving his
relations of the chief part of his fortune."
"With his lady?" cried our friend, in great agitation; for this story had affrighted him extremely.
"And alas!" replied the Doctor, who regarded Wilhelm's exclamation only as the voice of common sympathy;
"this lady is herself possessed with a deeper sorrow, which renders a removal from the world desirable to her also.
The same young man was taking leave of her; she was not circumspect enough to hide a nascent inclination
towards him; the youth grew bolder, clasped her in his arms, and pressed a large portrait of her husband, which
was set with diamonds, forcibly against her breast. She felt a sharp pain, which gradually went off, leaving first a
little redness, then no trace at all. As a man, I am convinced that she has nothing farther to reproach herself with,
in this affair; as a physician, I am certain that this pressure could not have the smallest ill effect. Yet she will not
be persuaded that an induration is not taking place in the part; and if you try to overcome her notion by the
Chapter XVI

170

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
evidence of feeling, she maintains, that though the evil is away this moment, it will return the next. She conceives
that the disease will end in cancer; and thus her youth and loveliness be altogether lost to others and herself."
"Wretch that I am!" cried Wilhelm, striking his brow, and rushing from the company into the fields. He had never
felt himself in such a miserable case.
The clergyman and the physician were of course exceedingly astonished at this singular discovery. In the evening,
all their skill was called for, when our friend returned, and, with a circumstantial disclosure of the whole
occurrence, uttered the most violent accusations of himself. Both took interest in him; both felt a real concern
about his general condition, particularly as he painted it in the gloomy colours which arose from the humour of
the moment.
Next day the physician, without much entreaty, was prevailed upon to accompany him in his return; both that he
might bear him company, and that he might, if possible, do something for Aurelia, whom our friend had left in
rather dangerous circumstances.
In fact, they found her worse than they expected. She was afflicted with a sort of intermittent fever, which could
the less be mastered, as she purposely maintained and aggravated the attacks of it. The stranger was not
introduced as a physician; he behaved with great courteousness and prudence. They conversed about her situation
bodily and mental: her new friend related many anecdotes of persons who, in spite of lingering disorders, had
attained a good old age; adding, that in such cases, nothing could be more injurious than the intentional recalling
of passionate and disagreeable emotions. In particular he stated, that for persons labouring under chronic and
partly incurable distempers, he had always found it a very happy circumstance when they chanced to entertain,
and cherish in their minds, true feelings of religion. This he signified in the most unobtrusive manner; as it were
historically; promising Aurelia at the same time the reading of a very interesting manuscript, which he said he had
received from the hands of an excellent lady of his friends, who was now deceased. "To me," he said, "it is of
uncommon value; and I shall trust you even with the original. Nothing but the title is in my handwriting: I have
called it, Confessions of a Fair Saint."
Touching the medical and dietetic treatment of the racked and hapless patient, he also left his best advice with
Wilhelm. He then departed; promising to write; and, if possible, to come again in person.
Meanwhile, in Wilhelm's absence, there had changes been preparing such as he was not aware of. During his
directorship, our friend had managed all things with a certain liberality and freedom; looking chiefly at the main
result. Whatever was required for dresses, decorations and the like, he had usually provided in a plentiful and
handsome style; and for securing the cooperation of his people, he had flattered their self−interest, since he could
not reach them by nobler motives. In this he felt his conduct justified the more, as Serlo for his own part never
aimed at being a strict economist; but liked to hear the beauty of his theatre commended; and was contented, if
Aurelia, who conducted the domestic matters, on defraying all expenses, signified that she was free from debt,
and could besides afford the necessary sums for clearing off such scores as Serlo in the interim, by lavish
kindness to his mistresses, or otherwise, might have incurred.
Melina, who was charged with managing the wardrobe, had all the while been silently considering these things,
with the cold spiteful temper peculiar to him. On occasion of our friend's departure, and Aurelia's increasing
sickness, he contrived to signify to Serlo, that more money might be raised and less expended; and consequently
something be laid up, or at least a merrier life be led. Serlo hearkened gladly to such allegations, and Melina
risked the exhibition of his plan.
"I will not say," continued he, "that any of your actors has at present too much salary; they are meritorious people,
they would find a welcome anywhere; but for the income which they bring us in, they have too much. My project
would be, to set up an opera: and as to what concerns the playhouse, I may be allowed to say it, you are the person
Chapter XVI

171

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
for maintaining that establishment upon your single strength. Observe how at present your merits are neglected;
and justice is refused you, not because your fellow actors are excellent, but merely good.
"Come out alone, as used to be the case; endeavour to attract around you middling, I will even say inferior people,
for a slender salary; regale the public with mechanical displays, as you can so cleverly do; apply your remaining
means to the opera, which I am talking of; and you will quickly see, that with the same labour and expense, you
will give greater satisfaction, while you draw incomparably more money than at present."
These observations were so flattering to Serlo, that they could not fail of making some impression on him. He
readily admitted, that, loving music as he did, he had long wished for some arrangement such as this: though he
could not but perceive that the public taste would thus be still more widely led astray; and that with such a
mongrel theatre, not properly an opera, not properly a playhouse, any residue of true feeling for regular and
perfect works of art must shortly disappear.
Melina ridiculed, in terms more plain than delicate, our friend's pedantic notions in this matter, and his vain
attempts to form the public mind, instead of being formed by it. Serlo and he at last agreed, with full conviction,
that the sole concern was how to gather money, and grow rich, or live a joyous life; and they scarcely concealed
their wish to be delivered from those persons who at present hindered them.
Melina took occasion to lament Aurelia's weak health, and the speedy end which it threatened; thinking all the
while directly the reverse. Serlo affected to regret that Wilhelm could not sing; thus signifying that his presence
was by no means indispensable. Melina then came forward with a whole catalogue of savings, which, he said,
might be effected, and Serlo saw in him his brother−in−law replaced threefold. Both of them felt well that secrecy
was necessary in the matter; but this mutual obligation only joined them closer in their interests. They failed not
to converse together privately, on everything that happened; to blame whatever Wilhelm or Aurelia undertook;
and to elaborate their own project, and prepare it more and more for execution.
Silent as they both might be about their plan, little as their words betrayed them, in their conduct they were not so
politic as constantly to hide their purposes. Melina now opposed our friend in many points that lay within the
province of the latter; and Serlo, who had never acted smoothly to his sister, seemed to grow more bitter, the more
her sickness deepened, the more her passionate and variable humours would have needed toleration.
About this period, they took up the Emilie Galotti of Lessing. The parts were very happily distributed and filled;
within the narrow circle of this tragedy, the company found room for showing all the complex riches of their
acting. Serlo in the character of Marinelli was altogether in his place; Odoardo was very well exhibited; Madam
Melina played the Mother with considerable skill; Elmira gained distinction as Emilie; Laertes made a stately
Appiani; and Wilhelm had bestowed the study of some months upon the Prince's part.
On this occasion, both internally and with Aurelia and Serlo, he had often come upon this question: What is the
distinction between a noble and a well−bred manner; and how far must the former be included in the latter,
though the latter is not in the former?
Serlo, who himself in Marinelli had to act the courtier accurately, without caricature, afforded him some valuable
thoughts on this. "A well−bred carriage," he would say, "is difficult to imitate; for in strictness it is negative; and
it implies a long−continued previous training. You are not required to exhibit in your manner anything that
specially be−tokens dignity; for, by this means, you are like to run into formality and haughtiness; you are rather
to avoid whatever is undignified and vulgar. You are never to forget yourself; are to keep a constant watch upon
yourself and others; to forgive nothing that is faulty in your own conduct, in that of others neither to forgive too
little nor too much. Nothing must appear to touch you, nothing to agitate: you must never overhaste yourself, must
ever keep yourself composed, retaining still an outward calmness, whatever storms may rage within. The noble
character at certain moments may resign himself to his emotions; the well−bred never. The latter is like a man

dressed out in fair and spotless clothes: he will not lean on anything; every person will beware of rubbing on him.
He distinguishes himself from others, yet he may not stand apart; for as in all arts, so in this, the hardest must at
length be done with ease: the well−bred man of rank, in spite of every separation, always seems united with the
people round him; he is never to be stiff or uncomplying; he is always to appear the first, and never to insist on so
appearing.
"It is clear, then, that to seem well−bred, a man must actually be so. It is also clear why women generally are
more expert at taking up the air of breeding than the other sex; why courtiers and soldiers catch it more easily than
other men."
Wilhelm now despaired of doing justice to his part; but Serlo aided and encouraged him; communicated the
acutest observations on detached points; and furnished him so well, that on the exhibition of the piece, the public
reckoned him a very proper Prince.
Serlo had engaged to give him, when the play was over, such remarks as might occur upon his acting; a
disagreeable contention with Aurelia prevented any conversation of that kind. Aurelia had acted the character of
Orsina, in such a style as few have ever done. She was well acquainted with the part; and during the rehearsals she
had treated it indifferently: but in the exhibition of the piece, she had opened as it were all the sluices of her
personal sorrow; and the character was represented, so as never poet in the first glow of invention could have
figured it. A boundless applause rewarded her painful efforts; but her friends, on visiting her when the play was
finished, found her half fainting in her chair.
Serlo had already signified his anger at her over−charged acting, as he called it; at this disclosure of her inmost
heart before the public, to many individuals of which the history of her fatal passion was more or less completely
known. He had spoken bitterly and fiercely; grinding with his teeth, and stamping with his feet, as was his custom
when enraged. "Never mind her," cried he, when he saw her in the chair, surrounded by the rest; "she will go upon
the stage stark−naked one of these days; and then the approbation will be perfect."
"Ungrateful, inhuman man!" exclaimed she; "soon shall I be carried naked to the place where approbation or
disapprobation can no longer reach our ears!" With these words she started up, and hastened to the door. The maid
had not yet brought her mantle; the sedan was not in waiting; it had been raining lately; a cold, raw wind was
blowing through the streets. They endeavoured to persuade her to remain, for she was very warm. But in vain: she
purposely walked slow; she praised the coolness, seemed to inhale it with peculiar eagerness. No sooner was she
home, than she became so hoarse that she could hardly speak a word: she did not mention that there was a total
stiffness in her neck and along her back.
Shortly afterwards, a sort of palsy in the tongue came on, so that she pronounced one word instead of another.
They put her to bed; by numerous and copious remedies, the evil changed its form, but was not mastered. The
fever gathered strength; her case was dangerous.
Next morning she enjoyed a quiet hour. She sent for Wilhelm, and delivered him a letter. "This sheet," said she,
"has long been waiting for the present moment. I feel that my end is drawing nigh: promise me that you yourself
will take this paper; that by a word or two, you will avenge my sorrows on the faithless man. He is not void of
feeling; my death will pain him for a moment."
Wilhelm took the letter; still endeavouring to console her, and to drive away the thought of death.
"No," said she, "do not deprive me of my nearest hope. I have waited for him long; I will joyfully clasp him when
he comes."

Shortly after this, the manuscript arrived, which the physician had engaged to send her. She called for Wilhelm;
made him read it to her. The effect, which it produced upon her, the reader will be better able to appreciate after
looking at the following Book. The violent and stubborn temper of our poor Aurelia was mollified by hearing it.
She took back the letter, and wrote another as it seemed in a meeker tone; charging Wilhelm at the same time to
console her friend, if he should be distressed about her death; to assure him that she had forgiven him, and wished
him every kind of happiness.
From this time, she was very quiet; and appeared to occupy herself with but a few ideas, which she endeavoured
to extract and appropriate from the manuscript, out of which she frequently made Wilhelm read to her. The decay
of her strength was not perceptible: nor had Wilhelm been anticipating the even, when one morning as he went to
visit her, he found that she was dead.
Entertaining such respect for her as he had done, and accustomed as he was to live in her society, the loss of her
affected him with no common sorrow. She was the only person that had truly wished him well; the coldness of
Serlo he had felt of late but too keenly. He hastened therefore to perform the service she had intrusted to him; he
wished to be absent for a time.
On the other hand, this journey was exceedingly convenient for Melina; in the course of his extensive
correspondence, he had lately entered upon terms with a male and female singer, who, it was intended, should, by
their performances in interludes, prepare the public for his future opera. The loss of Aurelia, and Wilhelm's
absence, were to be supplied in this manner; and our friend was satisfied with anything that could facilitate his
setting out.
He had formed, within himself, a singular idea of the importance of his errand. The death of his unhappy friend
had moved him deeply; and having seen her pass so early from the scene, he could not but be hostilely inclined
against the man, who had abridged her life, and made that shortened term so full of woe.
Notwithstanding the last mild words of the dying woman, he resolved that, on delivering his letter, he would pass
a strict sentence on her faithless friend; and not wishing to depend upon the temper of the moment, he studied an
address, which in the course of preparation became more pathetic than just.
Having fully convinced himself of the good composition of his essay, he began committing it to memory, and at
the same time making ready for departure. Mignon was present as he packed his articles; she asked him whether
he intended travelling south or north; and learning that it was the latter, she replied: "Then I will wait here for
thee." She begged of him the pearl necklace which had once been Mariana's. He could not refuse to gratify the
dear little creature, and he gave it her: the neckerchief she had already. On the other hand, she put the veil of
Hamlet's Ghost into his travelling bag, though he told her it could not be of any service to him.
Melina took upon him the directorship; his wife engaged to keep a mother's eye upon the children, whom
Wilhelm parted with unwillingly. Felix was very merry at the setting out, and when asked what pretty thing he
wished to have brought back for him, he said: "Hark you! bring me a papa!" Mignon seized the traveller's hand;
then, standing on her tiptoes, she pressed a warm and cordial, though not a tender kiss, upon his lips, and cried:
"Master! forget us not, and come soon back."
And so we leave our friend, entering on his journey, amid a thousand different thoughts and feelings; and here
subjoin, by way of close, a little poem, which Mignon had recited once or twice with great expressiveness, and
which the hurry of so many singular occurrences prevented us from inserting sooner:O, ask me not to speak, I
pray thee! It must not be reveal'd but hid;How gladly would my tongue obey thee, Did not the voice of Fate
forbid!At his appointed time revolving, The sun these shades of night dispels;The rock, its rugged breast
dissolving, Gives up to Earth its hidden wells. In Friendship's arms each heart reposes; There soul to soul pours
out its woe:My lips an oath forever closes, My sorrows God alone can know.

Book VI Confessions of a Fair Saint TILL my eighth year, I was always a healthy child; but of that period I can
recollect no more than of the day when I was born. About the beginning of my eighth year, I was seized with a
hemorrhage; and from that moment my soul became all feeling, all memory. The smallest circumstances of that
accident are yet before my eyes, as if they had occurred but yesterday.
During the nine months, which I then spent patiently upon a sick−bed, it appears to me, the ground−work of my
whole turn of thought was laid; as the first means were then afforded my mind of developing itself in its own
manner.
I suffered and I loved; this was the peculiar form of my heart. In the most violent fits of coughing, in the
depressing pains of fever, I lay quiet, like a snail drawn back within its house: the moment I obtained a respite, I
wanted to enjoy something pleasant; and as every other pleasure was denied me, I endeavoured to amuse myself
with the innocent delights of eye and ear. The people brought me dolls and picture−books; and whoever would sit
by my bed, was obliged to tell me something.
From my mother I rejoiced to hear the Bible histories: and my father entertained me with natural curiosities. He
had a very pretty cabinet; from which he brought me first one drawer and then another, as occasion served;
showing me the articles, and pointing out their properties. Dried plants and insects, with many kinds of
anatomical preparations, such as human skin, bones, mummies and the like, were in succession laid upon the
sick−bed of the little one; the birds and animals he killed in hunting were shown to me, before they passed into
the kitchen: and that the Prince of the World might also have a voice in this assembly, my aunt related to me
love−adventures out of fairy tales. All was accepted, all took root. There were hours in which I vividly conversed
with the Invisible Power. I can still repeat some verses, which I then dictated, and my mother wrote down.
Often I would tell my father back again what I had learned from him. Rarely did I take any physic without asking
where the simples it was made of grew, what look they had, what names they bore. Nor had the stories of my aunt
lighted on stony ground. I figured myself out in pretty clothes; and met the most delightful princes, who could
find no peace or rest, till they discovered who the unknown beauty was. One adventure of this kind, with a
charming little angel, dressed in white, with golden wings, who warmly courted me, I dwelt upon so long, that my
imagination painted out his form almost to visibility.
After a year, I was pretty well restored to health; but nothing of the giddiness of childhood remained with me. I
could not play with dolls; I longed for beings able to return my love. Dogs, cats and birds, of which my father
kept a great variety, afforded me delight: but what would I have given for such a creature as my aunt once told me
of! It was a lamb, which a peasant girl took up and nourished in a wood; but in the guise of this pretty beast an
enchanted prince was hid; who at length appeared in his native shape, a lovely youth, and rewarded his
benefactress by his hand. Such a lamb I would have given the world for.
But there was none to be had; and as everything about me went on in such a quite natural manner, I by degrees all
but abandoned nearly all hopes of such a treasure. Meanwhile I comforted myself by reading books, in which the
strangest incidents were set forth. Among them all, my favourite was the Christian German Hercules: that devout
love−history was altogether in my way. Whenever anything befell his dear Valiska, and cruel things befell her, he
always prayed before hastening to her aid, and the prayers stood there verbatim. My longing after the Invisible,
which I had always dimly felt, was strengthened by such means: for, in short, it was ordained that God should also
be my confidant.
As I grew older, I continued reading, Heaven knows what, in chaotic order. The Roman Octavia was the book I
liked beyond all others. The persecutions of the first Christians, decorated with the charms of a romance, awoke
the deepest interest in me.

But my mother now began to murmur at my constant reading; and to humour her, my father took away my books
today, but gave them back tomorrow. She was wise enough to see that nothing could be done in this way; she next
insisted merely that my Bible should be read with equal diligence. To this I was not disinclined: and I accordingly
perused the sacred volume with a lively interest. Withal my mother was extremely careful that no books of a
corruptive tendency should come into my hands: immodest writings I would, of my own accord, have cast away;
for my princes and my princesses were all extremely virtuous.
To my mother, and my zeal for knowledge, it was owing that with all my love of books I also learned to cook; for
much was to be seen in cookery. To cut up a hen, a pig, was quite a feast for me. I used to bring the entrails to my
father, and he talked with me about them, as if I had been a student of anatomy. With suppressed joy, he would
often call me his misfashioned son.
My twelfth year was now behind me. I learned French, dancing and drawing; I received the usual instructions in
religion. In the latter, many thoughts and feelings were awakened; but nothing properly relating to my own
condition. I liked to hear the people speak of God; I was proud that I could speak on these points better than my
equals. I zealously read many books which put me in a condition to talk about religion; but it never once struck
me to think how matters stood with me, whether my soul was formed according to these holy precepts, whether it
was like a glass from which the everlasting sun could be reflected in its glancing. From the first, I had
presupposed all this.
My French I learned with eagerness. My teacher was a clever man. He was not a vain empiric, not a dry
grammarian: he had learning, he had seen the world. Instructing me in language, he satisfied my zeal for
knowledge in a thousand ways. I loved him so much, that I used to wait his coming with a palpitating heart.
Drawing was not hard for me: I should have made greater progress had my teacher possessed head and science; he
had only hands and practice.
Dancing was, at first, one of my smallest amusements: my body was too sensitive for it; I learned it only in the
company of my sisters. But our dancing−master took a thought of gathering all his scholars, male and female, and
giving them a ball. This event gave dancing quiet another charm for me.
Amid a throng of boys and girls, the most remarkable were two sons of the Marshal of the Court. The younger
was of my age, the other two years older; they were children of such beauty that, according to the universal voice,
no one had seen their like. For my part, scarcely had I noticed them, when I lost sight of all the other crowd. From
that moment I began to dance with care, and to wish that I could dance with grace. How came it, on the other
hand, that these two boys distinguished me from all the rest? No matter; before an hour had passed, we had
become the warmest friends; and our little entertainment did not end, till we had fixed upon the time and place
where we were next to meet. What a joy for me! And how charmed was I next morning when both of them
inquired for my health, each in a gallant note, accompanied with a nosegay! I have never since felt as I then did!
Compliment was met by compliment; letter answered letter. The church and the public walks were grown a
rendezvous; our young acquaintances, in all their little parties, now invited us together; while, at the same time,
we were sly enough to veil the business from our parents, so that they saw no more of it than we thought good.
Thus had I at once got a pair of lovers. I had yet decided upon neither; they both pleased me, and we did
extremely well together. All at once, the elder of the two fell very sick. I myself had often been sick; and thus I
was enabled, by rendering him many little dainties and delicacies suited for a sick person, to afford some solace to
the sufferer. His parents thankfully acknowledged my attention: in compliance with the prayer of their beloved
son, they invited me, with all my sisters, to their house, so soon as he had risen from his sick−bed. The tenderness,
which he displayed on meeting me, was not the feeling of a child; from that day I gave the preference to him. He
warned me to keep our secret from his brother; but the flame could no longer be concealed; and the jealousy of
the younger completed our romance. He played us a thousand tricks; eager to annihilate our joys, he but increased
the passion he was seeking to destroy.

At last, then, I had actually found the wished−for lamb; and this attachment acted on me like my sickness; it made
me calm, and drew me back from noisy pleasures. I was solitary, I was moved; and thoughts of God again
occurred to me. He was again my confidant, and I well remember with what tears I often prayed for this poor boy,
who still continued sickly.
The more childishness there was in this adventure, the more did it contribute to the forming of my heart. Our
French teacher had now turned us from translating, into daily writing him some letter of our own invention. I
brought my little history to market, shrouded in the names of Phyllis and Damon. The old man soon saw through
it; and to render me communicative, praised my labour very much. I still waxed bolder; came openly out with the
affair, adhering even in the minute details to truth. I do not now remember what the passage was at which he took
occasion to remark: "How pretty, how natural it is! But the good Phyllis had better have a care; the thing may
soon grow serious."
It vexed me that he did not look upon the matter as already serious; and I asked him, with an air of pique, what he
meant by serious. I had not to repeat the question; he explained himself so clearly, that I could scarcely hide my
terror. Yet, as anger came along with it, as I took it ill that he should entertain such thoughts, I kept myself
composed; I tried to justify my nymph; and said with glowing cheeks: "But, sir, Phyllis is an honourable girl."
He was rogue enough to banter me about my honourable heroine. While we were speaking French, he played
upon the word honnête, and hunted the honourableness of Phyllis over all its meanings. I felt the ridicule of this,
and was extremely puzzled. He, not to frighten me, broke off; but afterwards often led the conversation to such
topics. Plays and little histories, such as I was reading and translating with him, gave him frequent opportunity to
show how feeble a security against the calls of inclination our boasted virtue was. I no longer contradicted him;
but I was in secret scandalised; and his remarks became a burden to me.
With my worthy Damon, too, I by degrees fell out of all connexion. The chicanery of the younger boy destroyed
our intercourse. Soon after, both these blooming creatures died, I lamented sore; however, in a short time I forgot.
But Phyllis rapidly increased in stature; was altogether healthy, and began to see the world. The hereditary Prince
now married; and a short time after, on his father's death, began his rule. Court and town were in the liveliest
motion: my curiosity had copious nourishment. There were plays and balls, with all their usual accompaniments;
and though my parents kept retired as much as possible, they were obliged to show themselves at court, where I
was of course introduced. Strangers were pouring in from every side; high company was in every house; even to
us some cavaliers were recommended, others introduced; and at my uncle's men of every nation might be met
with.
My honest Mentor still continued, in a modest and yet striking way, to warn me; and I in secret to take it ill of
him. With regard to his assertion, that women under every circumstance were weak, I did not feel at all
convinced; and here perhaps I was in the right, and my Mentor in the wrong; but he spoke so earnestly, that once I
grew afraid he might be right, and said to him, with much vivacity: "Since the danger is so great, and the human
heart so weak, I will pray to God that He may keep me."
This simple answer seemed to please him, for he praised my purpose; but on my side, it was anything but
seriously meant. It was, in truth, but an empty word; for my feelings towards the Invisible were almost totally
extinguished. The hurry and the crowd I lived in, dissipated my attention, and carried me along as in a rapid
stream. These were the emptiest years of my life. All day long, to speak of nothing, to have no solid thought;
never to do anything but revel: such was my employment. On my beloved books I never once bestowed a thought.
The people I lived among had not the slightest tinge of literature or science: they were German courtiers; a class
of men at that time altogether destitute of culture.

Chapter XVI

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Such society, it may be thought, must naturally have led me to the brink of ruin. I lived away in mere corporeal
cheerfulness; I never took myself to task, I never prayed, I never thought about myself or God. Yet I look upon it
as a providential guidance, that none of these many handsome, rich and well−dressed men could take my fancy.
They were rakes, and did not conceal it; this scared me back: they adorned their speech with double meanings;
this offended me, made me act with coldness towards them. Many times their improprieties exceeded belief; and I
did not restrain myself from being rude.
Besides, my ancient counsellor had once in confidence contrived to tell me, that, with the greater part of these
lewd fellows, health as well as virtue was in danger. I now shuddered at the sight of them; I was afraid, if one of
them in any way approached too near me. I would not touch their cups or glasses, even the chairs they had been
sitting on. Thus morally and physically I remained apart from them; all the compliments they paid me I haughtily
accepted, as incense that was due.
Among the strangers then resident among us, was one young man peculiarly distinguished, whom we used in
sport to call Narciss. He had gained a reputation in the diplomatic line; and among the various changes now
occurring at court, he was in hopes of meeting with some advantageous place. He soon became acquainted with
my father: his acquirements and manners opened for him the way to a select society of most accomplished men.
My father often spoke in praise of him: his figure, which was very handsome, would have made a still better
impression, had it not been for something of self−complacency, which breathed from the whole carriage of the
man. I had seen him; I thought well of him; but we had never spoken.
At a great ball, where we chanced to be in company, I danced a minuet with him; but this too passed without
results. The more violent dances, in compliance with my father, who felt anxious about my health, I was
accustomed to avoid: in the present case, when these came on, I retired to an adjoining room, and began to talk
with certain of my friends, elderly ladies, who had set themselves to cards.
Narciss, who had jigged it for a while, at last came into the room where I was; and having got the better of a
bleeding at the nose, which had overtaken him in dancing, he began speaking with me about a multitude of things.
In half an hour, the talk had grown so interesting, that neither of us could think of dancing any more. We were
rallied by our friends; but we did not let their bantering disturb us. Next evening, we recommenced our
conversation, and were very careful not to hurt our health.
The acquaintance, then, was made. Narciss was often with my sisters and myself; and I now once more began to
reckon over and consider what I knew, what I thought of, what I had felt, and what I could express myself about
in conversation. My new friend had mingled in the best society; besides the department of history and politics,
with every part of which he was familiar, he had gained extensive literary knowledge; there was nothing new that
issued from the press, especially in France, that he was unacquainted with. He brought or sent me many a pleasant
book; but this we had to keep as secret as forbidden love. Learned women had been made ridiculous, nor were
well−informed women tolerated,−apparently, because it would have been uncivil to put so many ill−informed
men to shame. Even my father, much as he delighted in this new opportunity of cultivating my mind, expressly
stipulated that our literary commerce should remain secret.
Thus our intercourse continued for almost year and day; and still I could not say that, in any wise, Narciss had
ever shown me aught of love or tenderness. He was always complaisant and kind; but manifested nothing like
attachment: on the contrary, he even seemed to be in some degree affected by the charms of my youngest sister,
who was then extremely beautiful. In sport, he gave her many little friendly names, out of foreign tongues; for he
could speak two or three of these extremely well, and loved to mix their idiomatic phrases with his German. Such
compliments she did not answer very liberally; she was entangled in a different noose; and being very sharp,
while he was very sensitive, the two were often quarrelling about trifles. With my mother and my aunt he kept on
very pleasant terms; and thus by gradual advances, he was grown to be a member of the family.

Chapter XVI

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Who knows how long we might have lived in this way, had not a curious accident altered our relations all at once.
My sisters and I were invited to a certain house, to which we did not like to go. The company was too mixed; and
persons of the stupidest, if not the rudest stamp were often to be met there. Narciss, on this occasion, was invited
also; and on his account I felt inclined to go, for I was sure of finding one, at least, whom I could converse with as
I desired. Even at table, we had many things to suffer; for several of the gentlemen had drunk too much: then, in
the drawing−room, they insisted on a game at forfeits. It went on, with great vivacity and tumult. Narciss had lost
a forfeit: they ordered him, by way of penalty, to whisper something pleasant in the ear of every member of the
company. It seems, he stayed too long beside my next neighbour, the lady of a captain. The latter on a sudden
struck him such a box with his fist, that the powder flew about me, into my eyes. When I had got my eyes cleared,
and in some degree recovered from my terror, I saw that both gentlemen had drawn their swords. Narciss was
bleeding; and the other, mad with wine and rage and jealousy, could scarcely be held back by all the company. I
seized Narciss, led him by the arm up−stairs; and as I did not think my friend safe even here from his frantic
enemy, I shut the door and bolted it.
Neither of us considered the wound serious; for a slight cut across the hand was all we saw. Soon, however, I
discovered that there was a stream of blood running down his back, that there was a deep wound on the head. I
now began to be afraid. I hastened to the lobby, to get help; but I could see no person; every one had stayed below
to calm the raving captain. At last a daughter of the family came skipping up; her mirth annoyed me; she was like
to die with laughing at the bedlam spectacle. I conjured her, for the sake of Heaven, to get a surgeon; and she, in
her wild way, sprang down−stairs to fetch me one herself.
Returning to my wounded friend, I bound my handkerchief about his hand; and a neckerchief, that was hanging
on the door, about his head. He was still bleeding copiously: he now grew pale, and seemed as if he were about to
faint. There was none at hand to aid me: I very freely put my arm round him; patted his cheek, and tried to cheer
him by little flatteries. It seemed to act on him like a spiritual remedy; he kept his senses, but sat as pale as death.
At last the active housewife arrived: it is easy to conceive her terror when she saw my friend in this predicament,
lying in my arms, and both of us bestreamed with blood. No one had supposed he was wounded; all imagined I
had carried him away in safety.
Now smelling−bottles, wine and everything that could support and stimulate were copiously produced. The
surgeon also came; and I might easily have been dispensed with. Narciss, however, held me firmly by the hand; I
would have stayed without holding. During the dressing of his wounds, I continued wetting his lips with wine; I
minded not though all the company were now about us. The surgeon having finished, his patient took a mute but
tender leave of me, and was conducted home.
The mistress of the house now led me to her bedroom: she had to strip me altogether; and I must confess, while
they washed the blood from me, I saw with pleasure, for the first time, in a mirror, that I might be reckoned
beautiful without help of dress. No portion of my clothes could be put on again; and as the people of the house
were all either less or larger than myself, I was taken home in a strange disguise. My parents were, of course,
astonished. They felt exceedingly indignant at my fright, at the wounds of their friend, at the captain's madness, at
the whole occurrence. A very little would have made my father send the captain a challenge, that he might avenge
his friend without delay. He blamed the gentlemen that had been there, because they had not punished on the spot
such a murderous attempt; for it was but too clear, that the captain, instantly on striking, had drawn his sword, and
wounded the other from behind. The cut across the hand had been given, just when Narciss himself was grasping
at his sword. I felt unspeakably affected, altered; or, how shall I express it? The passion which was sleeping at the
deepest bottom of my heart, had at once broken loose, like a flame getting air. And if joy and pleasure are well
suited for the first producing and the silent nourishing of love, yet this passion, bold by nature, is most easily
impelled by terror to decide and to declare itself. My mother gave her little flurried daughter some medicine, and
made her go to bed. With the earliest morrow, my father hastened to Narciss, whom he found lying very sick of a
wound−fever.

He told me little of what passed between them; but tried to quiet me about the probable results of this event. They
were now considering whether an apology should be accepted, whether the affair should go before a court of
justice, and many other points of that description. I knew my father too well to doubt that he would be averse to
see the matter end without a duel: but I held my peace; for I had learned from him before, that women should not
meddle in such things. For the rest, it did not strike me as if anything had passed between the friends, in which my
interests were specially concerned: but my father soon communicated to my mother the purport of their farther
conversation. Narciss, he said, appeared to be exceedingly affected at the help afforded by me; had embraced him,
declared himself my debtor forever; signified that he desired no happiness except what he could share with me,
and concluded by entreating that he might presume to ask my hand. All this mamma repeated to me, but subjoined
the safe reflection, that "as for what was said in the first agitation of mind in such a case, there was little trust to
be placed in it." "Of course, none," I answered, with affected coldness; though all the while I was feeling Heaven
knows what.
Narciss continued sick for two months; owing to the wound in his right hand, he could not even write. Yet, in the
mean time, he showed me his regard by the most obliging courtesies. All these unusual attentions I combined with
what my mother had disclosed to me; and constantly my head was full of fancies. The whole city talked of the
occurrence. With me they spoke of it in a peculiar tone; they drew inferences which, greatly as I struggled to
avoid them, touched me very close. What had formerly been habitude and trifling, was now grown seriousness
and inclination. The anxiety in which I lived was the more violent, the more carefully I studied to conceal it from
every one. The idea of losing him frightened me; the possibility of any closer union made me tremble. For a
half−prudent girl there is really something awful in the thought of marriage.
By such incessant agitations, I was once more led to recollect myself. The gaudy imagery of a thoughtless life,
which used to hover day and night before my eyes, was at once blown away. My soul again began to awaken: but
the greatly interrupted intimacy with my Invisible Friend was not so easy to renew. We still continued at a frigid
distance: it was again something; but little to the times of old.
A duel had been fought, and the captain severely wounded, before I ever heard of it. The public feeling was, in all
senses, strong on the side of my lover, who at length again appeared upon the scene. But first of all, he came, with
his head tied up and his arm in a sling, to visit us. How my heart beat while he was there! The whole family was
present; general thanks and compliments were all that passed on either side; Narciss, however, found an
opportunity to show some secret tokens of his love to me, by which means my inquietude was but increased. After
his recovery, he visited us throughout the winter on the former footing; and in spite of all the soft private marks of
tenderness which he contrived to give me, the whole affair remained unsettled, undiscussed.
In this manner was I kept in constant practice. I could trust my thoughts to no mortal; and from God I was too far
removed. Him I had quite forgotten, those four wild years: I now again began to think of him occasionally; but
our acquaintance had grown cool; they were visits of mere ceremony these; and as, moreover, in waiting on him, I
used to dress in fine apparel, to set before him self−complacently my virtue, honour and superiorities to others, he
did not seem to notice me, or know me in that finery.
A courtier would have been exceedingly distressed, if the prince who held his fortune in his hands had treated him
in this way; but for me, I did not sorrow at it. I had what I required, health and conveniences; if God should please
to think of me, well; if not, I reckoned I had done my duty.
This, in truth, I did not think at that period; yet it was the true figure of my soul. But, to change and purify my
feelings, preparations were already made.
The spring came on: Narciss once visited me, unannounced, and at a time when I happened to be quite alone. He
now appeared in the character of lover; and asked me if I could bestow on him my heart, and so soon as he should
obtain some lucrative and honourable place, my hand along with it.
Chapter XVI

He had been received into our service: but at first they kept him back, and would not rapidly promote him,
because they dreaded his ambition. Having some little fortune of his own, he was left with a slender salary.
Notwithstanding my regard for him, I knew that he was not a man to treat with altogether frankly. I drew up,
therefore, and referred him to my father. About my father he did not seem to doubt; but wished first to be at one
with me, now and here. I at last said, Yes; but stipulated as an indispensable condition that my parents should
concur. He then spoke formally with both of them; they signified their satisfaction; mutual promises were given,
on the faith of his advancement, which it was expected would be speedy. Sisters and aunts were informed of this
arrangement, and the strictest secrecy enjoined on them.
Thus from a lover I had got a bridegroom. The difference between the two soon showed itself to be considerable.
If one could change the lovers of all honourable maidens into bridegrooms, it would be a kindness to our sex,
even though marriage should not follow the connexion. The love between two persons does not lessen by the
change, but it becomes more reasonable. Innumerable little follies, all coquetries and caprices, disappear. If the
bridegroom tells us, that we please him better in a morning−cap than in the finest head−dress, no discreet young
woman will disturb herself about her hair−dressing; and nothing is more natural than that he too should think
solidly, and rather wish to form a housewife for himself, than a gaudy doll for others. And thus it is in every
province of the business.
Should a young woman, of this kind, be fortunate enough to have a bridegroom who possesses understanding and
acquirements, she learns from him more than universities and foreign lands can teach. She not only willingly
receives instruction when he offers it, but she endeavours to elicit more and more from him. Love makes much
that was impossible possible. By degrees too, that subjection, so necessary and so graceful for the female sex,
begins: the bridegroom does not govern like the husband; he only asks: but his mistress seeks to discover what he
wants, and to offer it before he asks it.
So did experience teach me what I would not for much have missed. I was happy; truly happy, as woman could be
in the world; that is to say, for a while.
Amid these quiet joys, a summer passed away. Narciss gave not the slightest reason to complain of him; he daily
became more dear to me; my whole soul was his; this he well knew, and knew also how to prize it. Meanwhile,
from seeming trifles, something rose, which by and by grew hurtful to our union.
Narciss behaved to me as to a bride, and never dared to ask of me such favours as were yet forbidden us. But,
about the boundaries of virtue and decorum, we were of very different opinions. I meant to walk securely; and so
never granted him the smallest freedom which the whole world might not have witnessed. He, used to dainties,
thought this diet very strict. On this point there was continual variance: he praised my modesty, and sought to
undermine my resolution.
The serious of my old French teacher now occurred to me, as well as the defence which I had once suggested in
regard to it.
With God I had again become a little more acquainted. He had given me a bridegroom whom I loved; and for this
I felt some thankfulness. Earthly love itself concentrated my soul, and put its powers in motion; nor did it
contradict my intercourse with God. I naturally complained to him of what alarmed me: but I did not perceive that
I myself was wishing and desiring it. In my own eyes I was strong; I did not pray: 'Lead us not into temptation!'
My thoughts were far beyond temptation. In this flimsy tinsel−work of virtue I came to God; he did not drive me
back. On the smallest movement towards him, he left a soft impression in my soul; and this impression caused me
always to return.

Chapter XVI

Except Narciss, the world was altogether dead to me; excepting him, there was nothing in it that had any charm.
Even my love for dress was but the wish to please him; if I knew that he was not to see me, I could spend no care
upon it. I liked to dance; but if he was not beside me, it seemed as if I could not bear the motion. At a brilliant
festival, if he was not invited, I could neither take the trouble of providing new things, nor of putting on the old
according to the mode. To me they were alike agreeable, or rather, I might say, alike burdensome. I used to
reckon such an evening very fairly spent, when I could join myself to any ancient card−party, though formerly I
had not the smallest taste for such things; and if some old acquaintance came and rallied me about it, I would
smile, perhaps for the first time all that night. So likewise it was with promenades, and every social entertainment
that can be imagined.Him had I chosen from all others,His would I be, and not another's;To me his love was all in
all.
Thus was I often solitary in the midst of company; and real solitude was generally acceptable to me. But my busy
soul could neither sleep nor dream; I felt and thought; and acquired, by degrees, some faculty to speak about my
feelings and my thoughts with God. Then were feelings of another sort unfolded; but these did not contradict the
former feelings: my affection to Narciss accorded with the universal scheme of nature: it nowhere hindered the
performance of a duty. They did not contradict each other, yet they were immensely different. Narciss was the
only living form which hovered in my mind, and to which my love was all directed; but the other feeling was not
directed towards any form, and yet it was unspeakably agreeable. I no longer have it, I no longer can impart it.
My lover, whom I used to trust with all my secrets, did not know of this. I soon discovered that he thought far
otherwise: he often gave me writings which opposed, with light and heavy weapons, all that can be called
connexion with the Invisible. I used to read the books, because they came from him; but at the end, I knew no
word of all that had been argued in them.
Nor, in regard to sciences and knowledge, was there want of contradiction in our conduct. He did as all men do,
he mocked at learned women; and yet he kept continually instructing me. He used to speak with me on all
subjects, law excepted; and while constantly procuring books of every kind for me, he frequently repeated the
uncertain precept, "That a lady ought to keep the knowledge she might have more secret than the Calvinist his
creed in Catholic countries." And while I, by natural consequence, endeavoured not to show myself more wise or
learned than formerly before the world, Narciss himself was commonly the first who yielded to the vanity of
speaking about me and my superiorities.
A nobleman of high repute, and at that time valued for his influence, his talents and accomplishments, was living
at our Court with great applause. He bestowed especial notice on Narciss, whom he kept continually about him.
They once had an argument about the virtue of women. Narciss repeated to me what had passed between them; I
was note wanting with my observations; and my friend required of me a written essay on the subject. I could write
French fluently enough; I had laid a good foundation with my teacher. My correspondence with Narciss was
likewise carried on in French: except in French books, there was then no elegant instruction to be had. My essay
pleased the Count; I was obliged to let him have some little songs, which I had lately been composing. In short,
Narciss appeared to revel without stint in the renown of his beloved: and the story, to his great contentment, ended
with a French epistle in heroic verse, which the Count transmitted to him on departing; in which their argument
was mentioned, and my friend reminded of his happiness in being destined, after all his doubts and errors, to learn
most certainly what virtue was, in the arms of a virtuous and charming wife.
He showed this poem first of all to me, and then to almost every one; each thinking of the matter what he pleased.
Thus did he act in several cases; every stranger, whom he valued, must be made acquainted in our house.
A noble family was staying for a season in the place, to profit by the skill of our physician. In this house too
Narciss was looked on as a son: he introduced me there; we found among these worthy persons the most pleasant
entertainment for mind and heart. Even the common pastimes of society appeared less empty here than elsewhere.
All knew how matters stood with us: they treated us as circumstances would allow, and left the main relation
Chapter XVI

182

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
unalluded to. I mention this one family, because in the afterperiod of my life it had a powerful influence on me.
Almost a year of our connexion had elapsed; and along with it, our spring was over. The summer came, and all
grew drier and more earnest.
By several unexpected deaths, some offices fell vacant which Narciss might make pretensions to. The instant was
at hand, when my whole destiny must be decided; and while Narciss, and all our friends, were making every
effort to efface some impressions which obstructed him at Court, and to obtain for him the wished−for situation, I
turned with my request to my Invisible Friend. I was received so kindly, that I gladly came again. I confessed,
without disguise, my wish that Narciss might obtain the place: but my prayer was not importunate; and I did not
require that it should happen for the sake of my petition.
The place was obtained by a far inferior competitor. I was dreadfully troubled at this news; I hastened to my
room, the door of which I locked behind me. The first fit of grief went off in a shower of tears; the next thought
was, "Yet it was not by chance that it happened;" and instantly I formed the resolution to be well content with it,
seeing even this apparent evil would be for my true advantage. The softest emotions then pressed in upon me, and
divided all the clouds of sorrow. I felt that, with help like this, there was nothing one might not endure. At dinner
I appeared quite cheerful, to the great astonishment of all the house.
Narciss had less internal force than I, and I was called upon to comfort him. In his family, too, he had many
crosses to encounter, some of which afflicted him considerably; and, such true confidence subsisting between us,
he intrusted me with all. His negotiations for entering on foreign service were not more fortunate; all this I felt
deeply on his account and mine; all this too I ultimately carried to the place where my petitions had already been
so well received.
The softer these experiences were, the oftener did I endeavour to renew them; I hoped continually to meet with
comfort where I had so often met with it. Yet I did not always meet with it: I was as one that goes to warm him in
the sunshine, while there is something standing in the way that makes a shadow. "What is this?" I asked myself. I
traced the matter zealously, and soon perceived that it all depended on the situation of my soul: if this was not
turned in the straightest direction towards God, I still continued cold; I did not feel his counter−influence; I could
obtain no answer. The second question was: "What hinders this direction?" Here I was in a wide field; I perplexed
myself in an inquiry, which lasted nearly all the second year of my attachment to Narciss. I might have ended the
investigation sooner; for it was not long till I had got upon the proper trace; but I would not confess it, and I
sought a thousand outlets.
I very soon discovered that the straight direction of my soul was marred by foolish dissipations, and employment
with unworthy things. The How and the Where were clear enough to me. Yet by what means could I help myself,
or extricate my mind from the calls of a world where everything was either cold indifference or hot insanity?
Gladly would I have left things standing as they were, and lived from day to day, floating down with the stream,
like other people whom I saw quite happy; but I durst not; my inmost feelings contradicted me too often. Yet if I
determined to renounce society, and alter my relations to others, it was not in my power. I was hemmed in as by a
ring drawn round me; certain connexions I could not dissolve; and, in the matter which lay nearest to my heart,
fatalities accumulated and oppressed me more and more. I often went to bed with tears; and, after a sleepless
night, arose again with tears: I required some strong support; and God would not vouchsafe it me, while I was
running with the cap and bells.
I proceeded now to estimate my doings, all and each; dancing and play were first put upon their trial. Never was
there anything spoken, thought or written for or against these practices, which I did not examine, talk of, read,
weigh, reject, aggravate, and plague myself about. If I gave up these habits, I was certain that Narciss would be
offended; for he dreaded exceedingly the ridicule which any look of straitlaced conscientiousness gives one in the
eyes of the world. And doing what I now looked upon as folly, noxious folly, out of no taste of my own, but
Chapter XVI

183

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
merely to gratify him, it all grew wofully irksome to me.
Without disagreeable prolixities and repetitions, it is not in my power to represent what pains I took, in trying so
to counteract those occupations which distracted my attention and disturbed my peace of mind, that my heart, in
spite of them, might still be open to the influences of the Invisible Being. But at last, with pain, I was compelled
to admit, that in this way the quarrel could not be composed. For no sooner had I clothed myself in the garment of
folly, than it came to be something more than a mask, than the foolishness pierced and penetrated me through and
through.
May I here overstep the province of a mere historical detail, and offer one or two remarks on what was then
taking place within me? What could it be which so changed my tastes and feelings, that, in my twenty−second
year, nay earlier, I lost all relish for the recreations with which people of that age are harmlessly delighted? Why
were they not harmless for me? I may answer, Just because they were not harmless; because I was not, like others
of my years, unacquainted with my soul. No! I knew, from experiences which had reached me unsought, that
there are loftier emotions, which afford us a contentment such as it is vain to seek in the amusements of the world;
and that, in these higher joys, there is also kept a secret treasure for strengthening the spirit in misfortune.
But the pleasures of society, the dissipations of youth, must needs have had a powerful charm for me, since it was
not in my power to engage in them without participation, to act among them as if they were not there. How many
things could I now do, if I liked, with entire coldness, which then dazzled and confounded me, nay threatened to
obtain the mastery over me! Here there could no medium be observed: either those delicious amusements, or my
nourishing and quickening internal emotions, must be given up.
But in my soul, the strife had, without my own consciousness, already been decided. Even if there still was
anything within me that longed for earthly pleasures, I had now become unfitted for enjoying them. Much as a
man might hanker after wine, all desire of drinking would forsake him, if he should be placed among full barrels
in a cellar, where the foul air was like to suffocate him. Free air is more than wine: this I felt but too keenly; and
from the first, it would have cost me little studying to prefer the good to the delightful, if the fear of losing the
affection of Narciss had not restrained me. But at last, when after many thousand struggles, and thoughts
continually renewed, I began to cast a steady eye upon the bond which held me to him, I discovered that it was
but weak, that it might be torn asunder. I at once perceived it to be only as a glass bell, which shut me up in the
exhausted airless space: One bold stroke to break the bell in pieces, and thou art delivered!
No sooner thought than tried. I drew off the mask, and on all occasions acted as my heart directed. Narciss I still
cordially loved: but the thermometer, which formerly had stood in hot water, was now hanging in the natural air;
it could rise no higher than the warmth of the atmosphere directed.
Unhappily it cooled very much. Narciss drew back, and began to assume a distant air: this was at his option; but
my thermometer descended as he drew back. Our family observed this; questioned me, and seemed to be
surprised. I explained to them with stout defiance, that heretofore I had made abundant sacrifices; that I was
ready, still farther and to the end of my life, to share all crosses that befell him; but that I required full freedom in
my conduct, that my doings and avoidings must depend upon my own conviction; that indeed I would never
bigotedly cleave to my own opinion, but on the other hand would willingly be reasoned with; yet, as it concerned
my own happiness, the decision must proceed from myself, and be liable to no manner of constraint. The greatest
physician could not move me by his reasonings to take an article of food, which perhaps was altogether
wholesome and agreeable to many, so soon as my experience had shown that on all occasions it was noxious to
me; as I might produce coffee for an instance; and just as little, nay still less, would I have any sort of conduct
which misled me, preached up and demonstrated upon me as morally profitable.
Having so long prepared myself in silence, these debates were rather pleasant than vexatious to me. I gave vent to
my soul; I felt the whole worth of my determination. I yielded not a hair's−breadth; and those to whom I owed no
Chapter XVI

184

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
filial respect were sharply handled and dispatched. In the family I soon prevailed. My mother from her youth had
entertained these sentiments, though in her they had never reached maturity; for no necessity had pressed upon
her, and exalted her courage to achieve her purpose. She rejoiced in beholding her silent wishes fulfilled through
me. My younger sisters seemed to join themselves with me; the second was attentive and quiet. Our aunt had the
most to object. The arguments which she employed appeared to her irrefragable; and they were irrefragable, being
altogether commonplace. At last I was obliged to show her, that she had no voice in the affair in any sense; and
after this, she seldom signified that she persisted in her views. She was indeed the only person that observed this
transaction close at hand, without in some degree experiencing its influence. I do not calumniate her, when I say
that she had no character, and the most limited ideas.
My father had acted altogether in his own way. He spoke not much, but often, with me on the matter: his
arguments were rational; and being his arguments, they could not be impugned. It was only the deep feeling of my
right that gave me strength to dispute against him. But the scenes soon changed; I was forced to make appeal to
his heart. Straightened by his understanding, I came out with the most pathetic pleadings. I gave free course to my
tongue and to my tears. I showed him how much I loved Narciss; how much constraint I had for two years been
enduring; how certain I was of being in the right; that I was ready to testify that certainty, by the loss of my
beloved bridegroom and prospective happiness; nay, if it were necessary, by the loss of all that I possessed on
earth; that I would rather leave my native country, my parents and my friends, and beg my bread in foreign lands,
than act against these dictates of my conscience. He concealed his emotion; he said nothing on the subject for a
while, and at last he openly declared in my favour.
During all this time Narciss forbore to visit us; and my father now gave up the weekly club, where he was used to
meet him. The business made a noise at court, and in the town. People talked about it, as is common in such cases,
which the public takes a vehement interest in, because its sentence has usurped an influence on the resolutions of
weak minds. I knew enough about the world to understand that one's conduct is often censured by the very
persons who would have advised it, had one consulted them: and independently of this, with my internal
composure, I should have looked on all such transitory speculations just as if they had not been.
On the other hand, I hindered not myself from yielding to my inclination for Narciss. To me he had become
invisible, and to him my feelings had not altered. I loved him tenderly; as it were anew, and much more
steadfastly than before. If he chose to leave my conscience undisturbed, then I was his: wanting this condition, I
would have refused a kingdom with him. For several months, I bore these feelings and these thoughts about with
me; and finding, at last, that I was calm and strong enough to go peacefully and firmly to work, I wrote him a
polite but not a tender note, inquiring why he never came to see me.
As I knew his manner of avoiding to explain himself, in little matters, but of silently doing what seemed good to
him I purposely urged him in the present instance. I got a long and, as it seemed to me, pitiful reply, in vague style
and unmeaning phrases, stating, that without a better place, he could not fix himself, and offer me his hand; that I
best knew how hard it had fared with him hitherto; that as he was afraid lest a fruitless intercourse, so long
continued, might prove hurtful to my reputation, I would give him leave to continue at his present distance; so
soon as it was in his power to make me happy, he would look upon the word which he had given me as sacred.
I answered him on the spot, that as our intercourse was known to all the world, it might perhaps be rather late to
spare my reputation; for which, at any rate, my conscience and my innocence were the surest pledges: however,
that I hereby freely gave him back his word, and hoped the change would prove a happy one for him. The same
hour I received a short reply, which was, in all essential particulars, entirely synonymous with the first. He
adhered to his former statement, that so soon as he obtained a situation, he would ask me, if I pleased to share his
fortune with him.
This I interpreted as meaning simply nothing. I signified to my relations and acquaintances, that the affair was
altogether settled; and it was so in fact. Having, nine months afterwards, obtained the much−desired preferment,
Chapter XVI

185

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
he offered me his hand; but under the condition, that as the wife of a man who must keep house like other people,
I should alter my opinions. I returned him many thanks: and hastened with my heart and mind away from this
transaction; as one hastens from the playhouse when the curtain falls. And as he, a short time afterwards, had
found a rich and advantageous match, a thing now easy for him; and as I now knew him to be happy in the way he
liked, my own tranquillity was quite complete.
I must not pass in silence the fact, that several times before he got a place, and after it, there were respectable
proposals made to me; which, however, I declined without the smallest hesitation, much as my father and my
mother could have wished for more compliance on my part.
At length, after a stormy March and April, the loveliest May weather seemed to be allotted me. With good health,
I enjoyed an indescribable composure of mind: look around me as I pleased, my loss appeared a gain to me.
Young and full of sensibility, I thought the universe a thousand times more beautiful than formerly, when I
required to have society and play, that in the fair garden tedium might not overtake me. And now, as I did not
conceal my piety, I likewise took heart to own my love for the sciences and arts. I drew, painted, read; and found
enow of people to support me: instead of the great world, which I had left, or rather which had left me, a smaller
one formed itself about me, which was infinitely richer and more entertaining. I had a turn for social life; and I do
not deny that, on giving up my old acquaintances, I trembled at the thought of solitude. I now found myself
abundantly, perhaps excessively, indemnified. My acquaintances ere long were very numerous; not at home only,
but likewise among people at a distance. My story had been noised abroad; and many persons felt a curiosity to
see the woman who had valued God above her bridegroom. There was a certain pious tone to be observed, at that
time, generally over Germany. In the families of several counts and princes, a care for the welfare of the soul had
been awakened. Nor were there wanting noblemen who showed a like attention; while in the inferior classes,
sentiments of this kind were diffused on every side.
The noble family, whom I mentioned above, now drew me nearer to them. They had, in the mean while, gathered
strength; several of their relations having settled in the town. These estimable persons courted my familiarity, as I
did theirs. They had high connexions; I became acquainted, in their house, with a great part of the princes, counts
and lords of the Empire. My sentiments were not concealed from any one; they might be honoured or be tolerated;
I obtained my object, none attacked me.
There was yet another way, by which I was again led back into the world. About this period, a step−brother of my
father, who till now had never visited the house except in passing, stayed with us for a considerable time. He had
left the service of his court, where he enjoyed great influence and honour, simply because all matters were not
managed quite according to his mind. His intellect was just, his character was rigid. In these points he was very
like my father; only the latter had withal a certain touch of softness, which enabled him with greater ease to yield
a little in affairs, and though not to do, yet to permit, some things against his own conviction; and then to
evaporate his anger at them, either in silence by himself, or in confidence amid his family. My uncle was a great
deal younger; and his independence of spirit had been favoured by his outward circumstances. His mother had
been very rich; and he still had large possessions to expect from her near and distant relatives; so he needed no
foreign increase; whereas my father, with his moderate fortune, was bound to his place by the consideration of his
salary.
My uncle had become still more unbending from domestic sufferings. He had early lost an amiable wife and a
hopeful son; and from that time he appeared to wish to push away from him everything that did not hang upon his
individual will.
In our family it was whispered now and then with some complacency, that probably he would not wed again, and
so we children might anticipate inheriting his fortune. I paid small regard to this: but the demeanour of the rest
was not a little modified by their hopes. In his own imperturbable firmness of character, my uncle had grown into
the habit of never contradicting any one in conversation. On the other hand, he listened with a friendly air to every
Chapter XVI

186

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
one's opinion; and would himself elucidate and strengthen it by instances and reasons of his own. All who did not
know him fancied that he thought as they did: for he was possessed of a preponderating intellect, and could
transport himself into the mental state of any man, and imitate his manner of conceiving. With me he did not
prosper quite so well: for here the question was about emotions, of which he had not any glimpse; and with
whatever tolerance, and sympathy, and rationality, he spoke about my sentiments, it was palpable to me that he
had not the slightest notion of what formed the ground of all my conduct.
With all his secrecy, we by and by found out the aim of his unusual stay with us. He had, as we at length
discovered, cast his eyes upon our youngest sister, with the view of giving her in marriage and rendering her
happy as he pleased: and certainly, considering her personal and mental attractions, particularly when a handsome
fortune was laid into the scale along with them, she might pretend to the first matches. His feelings towards me he
likewise showed us pantomimically, by procuring me a post of Canoness, the income of which I very soon began
to draw.
My sister was not so contented with his care as I. She now disclosed to me a tender secret, which hitherto she had
very wisely kept back; fearing, as in truth it happened, that I would by all means counsel her against connexion
with a man who was not suited to her. I did my utmost, and succeeded.
The purpose of my uncle was too serious and too distinct; the prospect for my sister, with her worldly views, was
too delightful to be thwarted by a passion which her own understanding disapproved: she mustered force to give it
up.
On her ceasing to resist the gentle guidance of my uncle, the foundation of his plan was quickly laid. She was
appointed Maid of Honour at a neighbouring court, where he could commit her to the oversight and the
instructions of a lady, his friend, who presided there as Governess−in−Chief with great applause. I accompanied
her to the place of her new abode. Both of us had reason to be satisfied with the reception we met with: and
frequently I could not help, in secret, smiling at the character, which now as Canoness, as young and pious
Canoness, I was enacting in the world.
In earlier times, a situation such as this would have confused me dreadfully; perhaps have turned my head: but
now, in midst of all the splendours that surrounded me, I felt extremely cool. With great quietness, I let them
frizzle me, and deck me out for hours; and thought no more of it than that my place required me to wear that gala
livery. In the thronged saloons, I spoke with all and each, though no shape or character among them made any
impression on me. On returning to my house, nearly all the feeling I brought back with me was that of tired limbs.
Yet my understanding drew advantage from the multitude of persons whom I saw; and I became acquainted with
some ladies, patterns of every virtue, of a noble and good demeanour; particularly with the Governess−in−Chief,
under whom my sister was to have the happiness of being formed.
At my return, however, the consequences of this journey, in regard to health, were found to be less favourable.
With the greatest temperance, the strictest diet, I had not been, as I used to be, completely mistress of my time and
strength. Food, motion, rising and going to sleep, dressing and visiting, had not depended, as at home, on my own
conveniency and will. In the circle of social life, you cannot stop without a breach of courtesy: all that was
needful I had willingly performed; because I looked upon it as my duty, because I knew that it would soon be
over, and because I felt myself completely healthy. Yet this unusual restless life must have had more effect upon
me than I was aware of. Scarcely had I reached home, and cheered my parents with a comfortable narrative, when
I was attacked by a hemorrhage, which, although it did not prove dangerous of lasting, yet left a weakness after it,
perceptible for many a day.
Here, then, I had another lesson to repeat. I did it joyfully. Nothing bound me to the world; and I was convinced
that here the true good was never to be found: so I waited in the cheerfulest and meekest state; and after having
abdicated life, I was retained in it.

A new trial was awaiting me: my mother took a painful and oppressive ailment, which she had to bear five years,
before she paid the debt of nature. All this time we were sharply proved. Often, when her terror grew too strong,
she would have us all summoned, in the night, to her bed that so at least she might be busied, if not bettered, by
our presence. The load grew heavier, nay scarcely to be borne, when my father too became unwell. From his
youth, he had frequently had violent headaches; which, however, at longest never used to last beyond
six−and−thirty hours. But now they were continual; and when they mounted to a high degree of pain, his
moanings tore my very heart. It was in these tempestuous seasons that I chiefly felt my bodily weakness; because
it kept me from my holiest and dearest duties or rendered the performance of them hard to an extreme degree.
It was now that I could try whether the path, which I had chosen, was the path of phantasy or truth; whether I had
merely thought as others showed me, or the object of my trust had a reality. To my unspeakable support, I always
found the latter. The straight direction of my heart to God, the fellowship of the "Beloved Ones" 8 I had sought
and found; and this was what made all things light to me. As a traveller in the dark, my soul, when all was
pressing on me from without, hastened to the place of refuge, and never did it return empty.
In later times, some champions of religion, who seem to be animated more by zeal than feeling for it, have
required of their brethren to produce examples of prayers actually heard; apparently as wishing to have seal and
signature, that so they might proceed juridically in the matter. How unknown must the true feeling be to these
persons; how few real experiences can they themselves have made!
I can say that I never returned empty, when in straits and oppression I called on God. This is saying infinitely
much; more I must not and cannot say. Important as each experience was at the critical moment for myself, the
recital of them would be flat, improbable and insignificant, were I to specify the separate cases. Happy was I, that
a thousand little incidents in combination proved, as clearly as the drawing of my breath proved me to be living,
that I was not without God in the world. He was near to me, I was before him. This is what, with a diligent
avoidance of all theological systematic terms, I can with the greatest truth declare.
Much do I wish that, in those times too, I had been entirely without system. But which of us arrives early at the
happiness of being conscious of his individual self, in its own pure combination, without extraneous forms? I was
in earnest with religion. I timidly trusted in the judgments of others; I entirely gave in to the Halle system of
conversion; but my nature would by no means tally with it.
According to this scheme of doctrine, the alteration of the heart must begin with a deep terror on account of sin;
the heart in this agony must recognise, in a less or greater degree, the punishment which it has merited, must get a
foretaste of Hell, and so embitter the delight of sin. At last it feels a very palpable assurance of grace; which,
however, in its progress often fades away, and must again be sought with earnest prayer.
Of all this no jot or tittle happened with me. When I sought God sincerely, he let himself be found of me, and did
not reproach me about bygone things. On looking back, I saw well enough where I had been unworthy, where I
still was so; but the confession of my faults was altogether without terror. Not for a moment did the fear of Hell
occur to me: nay the very notion of a wicked Spirit, and a place of punishment and torment after death, could
nowise gain admission into the circle of my thoughts. I considered the men who lived without God, whose hearts
were shut against the trust in and the love of the invisible, as already so unhappy that a Hell and external pains
appeared to promise rather an alleviation than an increase of their misery. I had but to look upon the persons, in
this world, who in their breasts gave scope to hateful feelings; who hardened their hearts against the Good of
whatever kind, and strove to force the Evil on themselves and others; who shut their eyes by day, that so they
might deny the shining of the sun: How unutterably wretched did these persons seem to me! Who could have
formed a Hell to make their situation worse?
This mood of mind continued in me, without change, for half a score of years. It maintained itself through many
trials; even at the moving death−bed of my beloved mother. I was frank enough, on this occasion, not to hide my
Chapter XVI

188

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
comfortable frame of mind from certain pious but rigorously orthodox people; and I had to suffer many a friendly
admonition on that score. They reckoned they were just in season for explaining with what earnestness one should
be diligent to lay a right foundation in the days of health and youth.
In earnestness I too determined not to fail. For the moment, I allowed myself to be convinced; and fain would I
have grown, for life, distressed and full of fears. But what was my surprise on finding that I absolutely could not!
When I thought of God, I was cheerful and contented: even at the painful end of my dear mother, I did not
shudder at the thought of death. Yet I learned many and far other things than my uncalled teachers thought of, in
these solemn hours.
By degrees, I grew to doubt the dictates of so many famous people, and retained my own sentiments in silence. A
certain lady of my friends, to whom I had at first disclosed too much, insisted always on interfering with my
business. Of her too I was obliged to rid myself; I at last firmly told her, that she might spare herself this labour,
as I did not need her counsel; that I knew my God, and would have no guide but him. She was greatly offended; I
believe she never quite forgave me.
Such determination, to withdraw from the advices and the influence of my friends, in spiritual matters, produced
the consequence, that also in my temporal affairs I gained sufficient courage to obey my own persuasions. But for
the assistance of my faithful invisible Leader, I could not have prospered here. I am still gratefully astonished at
his wise and happy guidance. No one knew how matters stood with me; even I myself did not know.
The thing, the wicked and inexplicable thing, which separates us from the Being to whom we owe our life, and in
whom all that deserves the name of life must find its nourishment; the thing which we call Sin, I yet knew nothing
of.
In my intercourse with my invisible Friend, I felt the sweetest enjoyment of all my powers. My desire of
constantly enjoying this felicity was so predominant, that I abandoned without hesitation whatever marred our
intercourse; and here experience was my best teacher. But it was with me as with sick persons, who have no
medicine, and try to help themselves by diet. Something is accomplished, but far from enough.
I could not always live in solitude; though in it I found the best preservative against the dissipation of my
thoughts. On returning to the tumult, the impression it produced upon me was the deeper for my previous
loneliness. My most peculiar advantage lay in this, that love for quiet was my ruling passion, and that in the end I
still drew back to it. I perceived, as in a kind of twilight, my weakness and my misery; and tried to save myself by
avoiding danger and exposure.
For seven years, I had used my dietetic scheme. I held myself not wicked, and I thought my state desirable. But
for some peculiar circumstances and occurrences, I had remained in this position: it was by a curious path that I
got farther. Contrary to the advice of all my friends, I entered on a new connexion. Their objections, at first, made
me pause. I turned to my invisible Leader, and, as he permitted me, I went forward without fear.
A man of spirit, heart and talents had bought a property besides us. Among the strangers whom I grew acquainted
with, were this person and his family. In our manners, domestic economy and habits we accorded well; and thus
we soon approximated to each other.
Philo, as I propose to call him, was already middle−aged: in certain matters he was highly serviceable to my
father, whose strength was now decaying. He soon became the friend of the family; and finding in me, as he was
pleased to say, a person free alike from the extravagance and emptiness of the great world, and from the
narrowness and aridness of the still world in the country, he courted intimacy with me, and ere long we were in
one another's confidence. To me he was very pleasing and useful.

Chapter XVI

Though I did not feel the smallest inclination or capacity for mingling in public business, or seeking any influence
on it, yet I liked to hear about such matters, liked to know whatever happened far and near. Of worldly things, I
loved to get a clear though unconcerned perception: feeling, sympathy, affection, I reserved for God, for my
people and my friends.
The latter were, if I may say so, jealous of Philo, in my new connexion with him. In more than one sense, they
were right in warning me about it. I suffered much in secret; for even I could not consider their remonstrances as
altogether empty or selfish. I had been accustomed, from of old, to give a reason for my views and conduct; but in
this case my conviction would not follow. I prayed to God, that here as elsewhere he would warn, restrain and
guide me; and as my heart on this did not dissuade me, I went forward on my way with comfort.
Philo, on the whole, had a remote resemblance to Narciss; only a pious education had more enlivened and
concentrated his feelings. He had less vanity, more character; and in business, if Narciss was delicate, exact,
persevering, indefatigable the other was clear, sharp, quick and capable of working with incredible ease. By
means of him, I learned the secret history of almost every noble personage with whose exterior I had got
acquainted in society. It was pleasant for me to behold the tumult, off my watch−tower, from afar. Philo could
now hide nothing from me; he confided to me, by degrees, his own concerns both inward and outward. I was in
fear because of him; for I foresaw certain circumstances and entanglements; and the mischief came more speedily
than I had looked for. There were some confessions he had still kept back; and even at last he told me only what
enabled me to guess the worst.
What an effect had this upon my heart! I attained experiences which to me were altogether new. With infinite
sorrow, I beheld an Agathon, who, educated in the groves of Delphi, still owed his school−fees, which he was
now obliged to pay with their accumulated interest; and this Agathon was my especial friend. My sympathy was
lively and complete; I suffered with him; both of us were in the strangest state.
After having long occupied myself with the temper of his mind, I at last turned round to contemplate my own.
The thought, 'Thou art no better than he,' rose like a little cloud before me, and gradually expanded till it darkened
all my soul.
I now not only thought myself no better than he; I felt this, and felt it as I should not wish to do again. Nor was it
any transitory mood. For more than a year, I was compelled to feel that, had not an unseen hand restrained me, I
might have become a Girard, a Cartouche, a Damiens, or any wretch you can imagine. The tendencies to this I
traced too clearly in my heart. Heavens, what a discovery!
If hitherto I had never been able, in the faintest degree, to recognise in myself the reality of sin by experience, its
possibility was now become apparent to me by anticipation, in the frightfulest manner. And yet I knew not evil; I
but feared it; I felt that I might be guilty, and could not accuse myself of being so.
Deeply as I was convinced that such a temperament of soul, as I now saw mine to be, could never be adapted for
that union with the invisible Being, which I hoped for after death; I did not, in the smallest, fear that I should
finally be separated from him. With all the wickedness which I discovered in my heart, I still loved Him; I hated
what I felt, nay wished to hate it still more earnestly; my whole desire was to be delivered from this sickness, and
this tendency to sickness; and I was persuaded that the great Physician would at length vouchsafe his help.
The sole question was: What medicine will cure this malady? The practice of virtue? This I could not for a
moment think. For ten years, I had already practised more than mere virtue; and the horrors now first discovered
had, all the while, lain hidden at the bottom of my soul. Might they not have broken out with me, as they did with
David when he looked on Bathsheba? Yet was not he a friend of God; and was not I assured in my inmost heart
that God was my friend? Was it then an unavoidable infirmity of human nature? Must we just content ourselves in
feeling and acknowledging the sovereignty of inclination? And, with the best will, is there nothing left for us but
Chapter XVI

190

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
to abhor the fault we have committed, and on the like occasion to commit it again?p
From systems of morality I could obtain no comfort. Neither their severity, by which they try to bend our
inclinations, nor their attractiveness, by which they try to place our inclinations on the side of virtue, gave me any
satisfaction. The fundamental notions, which I had imbibed from intercourse with my invisible Friend, were of far
higher value to me.
Once, while I was studying the songs composed by David after that tremendous fall, it struck me very much that
he traced his indwelling corruption even in the substance out of which he had been shaped; yet that he wished to
be freed from sin, and that he earnestly entreated for a pure heart.
But how was this to be attained? The answer from Scripture I was well aware of: 'that the blood of Jesus cleanseth
us from all sin,' was a Bible truth which I had long known. But now for the first time, I observed that as yet I had
never understood this oft−repeated saying. The questions: What does it mean? How is it to be? were, day and
night, working out their answers in me. At last I thought I saw, as by a gleam of light, that what I sought was to be
found in the Incarnation of the everlasting Word, by whom all things, even we ourselves, were made. That the
Eternal descended as an inhabitant to the depths in which we dwell, which he surveys and comprehends; that he
passed through our lot from stage to stage, from conception and birth to the grave; that by this marvellous circuit
he again mounted to those shining Heights, whither we too must rise in order to be happy; all this was revealed to
me, as in a dawning remoteness.
Oh! why must we, in speaking of such things, make use of figures, which can only indicate external situations!
Where is there in his eyes aught high or deep, aught dark or clear? It is we only that have an Under and Upper, a
night and day. And even for this did he become like us, since otherwise we could have had no part in him.
But how shall we obtain a share in this priceless benefit? 'By faith,' the Scripture says. And what is faith? To
consider the account of an event as true, what help can this afford me? I must be enabled to appropriate its effects,
its consequences. This appropriating faith must be a state of mind peculiar, and to the natural man unknown.
'Now, gracious Father, grant me faith;' so prayed I once in the deepest heaviness of heart. I was leaning on a little
table, where I sat; my tear−stained countenance was hidden in my hands. I was now in the condition in which we
seldom are, but in which we are required to be, if God is to regard our prayers.
O, that I could but paint what I felt then! A sudden force drew my soul to the cross where Jesus once expired: it
was a sudden force, a pull, I cannot name it otherwise, such as leads our soul to an absent loved one; an
approximation, which perhaps is far more real and true than we imagine. So did my soul approach the Son of
Man, who died upon the cross; and that instant did I know what faith was.
'This is faith!' said I; and started up as if half frightened. I now endeavoured to get certain of my feeling, of my
view; and shortly I became convinced that my soul had acquired a power of soaring upwards, which was
altogether new to it.
Words fail us in describing such emotions. I could most distinctly separate them from all phantasy: they were
entirely without phantasy, without image; yet they gave us just such certainty of their referring to some object, as
our imagination gives us when it paints the features of an absent lover.
When the first rapture was over, I observed that my present condition of mind had formerly been known to me;
only I had never felt it in such strength; I had never held it fast, never made it mine. I believe, indeed, every
human soul at intervals feels something of it. Doubtless it is this which teaches every mortal that there is a God.

Chapter XVI

With such faculty, wont from of old to visit me now and then, I had hitherto been well content; and had not, by a
singular arrangement of events, that unexpected sorrow weighed upon me for a twelvemonth; had not my own
ability and strength, on that occasion, altogether lost credit with me; I perhaps might have remained content with
such a state of matters all my days.
But now, since that great moment, I had as it were got wings. I could mount aloft above what used to threaten me;
as the bird can fly singing and with ease across the fiercest stream, while the little dog stands anxiously baying on
the bank.
My joy was indescribable; and though I did not mention it to any one, my people soon observed an unaccustomed
cheerfulness in me, and could not understand the reason of my joy. Had I but forever held my peace, and tried to
nourish this serene temper in my soul! Had I not allowed myself to be misled by circumstances, so as to reveal my
secret! I might then have been saved, once more, a long and tedious circuit.
As in the previous ten years of my Christian course, this necessary force had not existed in my soul, I had just
been in the case of other worthy people; had helped myself by keeping my fancy always full of images, which had
some reference to God; a practice so far truly useful; for noxious images and their baneful consequences are by
that means kept away. Often too our spirit seizes one or other of these spiritual images, and mounts with it a little
way upwards; like a young bird fluttering from twig to twig.
Images and impressions pointing towards God are presented to us by the institutions of the Church, by organs,
bells, singing, and particularly by the preaching of our pastors. Of these I used to be unspeakably desirous: no
weather, no bodily weakness could keep me from church; the sound of the Sunday bells was the only thing that
rendered me impatient on a sick−bed. Our head Court−chaplain, a gifted man, I heard with great pleasure; his
colleagues too I liked; and I could pick the golden apple of the word from the common fruit, with which on
earthen platters it was mingled. With public ordinances, all sorts of private exercises were combined; and these
too only nourished fancy and a finer kind of sense. I was so accustomed to this track, I reverenced it so much, that
even now no higher one occurred to me. For my soul has only feeders, and not eyes; it gropes, but does not see:
Ah! that it could get eyes and look!
Now again, therefore, I went with a longing mind to sermon: but alas, what happened! I no longer found what I
was wont to find. These preachers were blunting their teeth on the shell, while I enjoyed the kernel. I soon grew
weary of them; and I had already been so spoiled, that I could not be content with the little they afforded me. I
required images, I wanted impressions from without; and reckoned it a pure spiritual desire that I felt.
Philo's parents had been in connexion with the Herrnhuter Community: in his library were many writings of
Count Zinzendorf's. He had spoken with me, more than once, very candidly and clearly on the subject; inviting
me to turn over one or two of these treatises, if it were but for the sake of studying a psychological phenomenon. I
looked upon the Count, and those that followed him, as very heterodox: and so the Ebersdorf Hymn−book, which
my friend had pressed upon me, lay unread.
However, in this total destitution of external excitements for my soul, I opened the Hymn−book, as it were by
chance; and found in it, to my astonishment, some songs which actually, though under a fantastic form, appeared
to shadow what I felt. The originality and simplicity of their expression drew me on. It seemed to be peculiar
emotions expressed in a peculiar way; no school technology suggested any notion of formality or commonplace. I
was persuaded that these people felt as I did: I was very happy to lay hold of here and there a stanza in their
songs, to fix it in my memory, and carry it about with me for days.
Since the moment when the truth had been revealed to me, some three months had in this way passed on. At last I
came to the resolution of disclosing everything to Philo, and asking him to let me have those writings, about
which I had now become immoderately curious. Accordingly I did so, notwithstanding there was something in my
Chapter XVI

192

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
heart which earnestly dissuaded me.
I circumstantially related to him all the story; and, as he was himself a leading person in it, and my narrative
conveyed the sharpest reprimand on him, he felt surprised and moved to an extreme degree. He melted into tears.
I rejoiced; believing that, in his mind also, a full and fundamental change had taken place.
He provided me with all the writings I could require; and now I had excess of nourishment for my imagination. I
made rapid progress in the Zinzendorfic mode of thought and speech. And be it not supposed that I am yet
incapable of prizing the peculiar turn and manner of the Count. I willingly do him justice; he is no empty
phantast; he speaks of mighty truths, and mostly in a bold figurative style; the people who despise him know not
either how to value or discriminate his qualities.
At that time, I became exceedingly attached to him. Had I been mistress of myself, I would certainly have left my
friends and country, and gone to join him. We should infallibly have understood each other, and should hardly
have agreed together long.
Thanks to my better genius that now kept me so confined by my domestic duties. I reckoned it a distant journey if
I visited the garden. The charge of my aged weakly father afforded me employment enough, and in hours of
recreation, I had Fancy to procure me pastime. The only mortal whom I saw was Philo; he was highly valued by
my father; but with me, his intimacy had been cooled a little by the late explanation. Its influence on him had not
penetrated deep; and as some attempts to talk in my dialect had not succeeded with him, he avoided touching on
this subject; and the rather, as his extensive knowledge put it always in his power to introduce new topics in his
conversation.
I was thus a Herrnhut sister on my own footing. I had especially to hide this new turn of my temper and my
inclinations from the head Court−chaplain; whom, as my father confessor, I had much cause to honour; and
whose high merits his extreme aversion to the Herrnhut Community did not diminish, in my eyes, even then.
Unhappily this worthy person had to suffer many troubles on account of me and others.
Several years ago, he had become acquainted with an upright pious gentleman, residing in a distant quarter; and
had long continued in unbroken correspondence with him, as with one who truly sought God. How painful was it
with the spiritual leader, when this gentleman subsequently joined himself to the Community of Herrnhut, where
he lived for a long while! How delightful, on the other hand, when at length he quarrelled with the Brethren;
determined to settle in our neighbourhood; and seemed once more to yield himself completely to the guidance of
his ancient friend!
The stranger was Presented, as in triumph, by the upper Pastor to all the chosen lambs of his fold. To our house
alone he was not introduced, because my father did not now see company. The gentleman obtained no little
approbation; he combined the polish of the court with the winning manner of the Brethren; and having also many
fine qualities by nature, he soon became the favourite saint with all who knew him; a result at which the chaplain
was exceedingly contented. But, alas! it was merely in externals that the gentleman had split with the Community;
in his heart he was yet entirely a Herrnhuter. He was, in truth, concerned for the reality of the matter: but yet the
gimcracks which the Count had stuck round it were, at the same time, quite adapted to this taste. Besides, he had
now become accustomed to this mode of speaking and conceiving; and if he had to hide it carefully from his old
friend, the gladder was he, in any knot of trusty persons, to come forth with his couplets, litanies and little figures;
in which, as might have been supposed, he met with great applause.
I knew nothing of the whole affair, and wandered quietly along in my separate path. For a good while we
continued mutually unknown.

Chapter XVI

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Once, in a leisure hour, I happened to visit a lady who was sick. I found several acquaintances with her; and soon
perceived that my appearance had cut short their conversation. I affected not to notice anything; but saw ere long,
with great surprise, some Herrnhut figures stuck upon the wall in elegant frames. Quickly comprehending what
had passed before my entrance, I expressed my pleasure at the sight, in a few suitable verses.
Conceive the wonder of my friends! We explained ourselves; instantly we were agreed, and in each other's
confidence.
I often henceforth sought opportunities of going out. Unhappily I found such only once in the three or four weeks;
yet I grew acquainted with our gentleman apostle, and by degrees with all the body. I visited their meetings, when
I could: with my social disposition, it was quite delightful for me to communicate to others, and to hear from
them, the feelings which, till now, I had conceived and harboured by myself.
But I was not so completely taken with my friends, as not to see that few of them could really feel the sense of
those affecting words and emblems; and that from these they drew as little benefit, as formerly they did from the
symbolic language of the Church. Yet, notwithstanding, I went on with them, not letting this disturb me. I
thought, I was not called to search and try the hearts of others. Had not I too, by long−continued innocent
exercisings of that sort, been prepared for something better? I had my share of profit from our meetings: in
speaking, I insisted on attending to the sense and spirit, which, in things so delicate, is rather apt to be disguised
by words than indicated by them; and for the rest, I left, with silent tolerance, each to act according to his own
conviction.
These quiet times of secret social joy were shortly followed by storms of open bickering and contradiction;
contentions which excited great commotion, I might almost say occasioned not a little scandal, in court and town.
The period was now arrived when our Chaplain, that stout gainsayer of the Herrnhut Brethren, must discover, to
his deep, but I trust, sanctified humiliation, that his best and once most zealous hearers were now all leaning to the
side of that Community. He was excessively provoked: in the first moments, he forgets all moderation and could
not, even if he had inclined it, retract afterwards. Violent debates took place; in which happily I was not
mentioned; both as being but an accidental member of those hated meetings; and then because, in respect of
certain civic matters, our zealous preacher could not safely disoblige either my father or my friend.
With silent satisfaction, I continued neutral. It was ink some to me to converse about such feelings and objects,
even with well−affected people, when they could not penetrate the deepest sense, and lingered merely on the
surface. But to strive with adversaries, about things on which even friends could scarcely understand each other,
seemed to me unprofitable, nay pernicious. For I soon perceived that many amiable noblemen, who on this
occurrence could not shut their hearts to enmity and hatred, had rapidly passed over to injustice; and in order to
defend an outward form, had almost sacrificed their most substantial duties.
Far as the worthy clergyman might, in the present case, be wrong; much as others tried to irritate me at him, I
could never hesitate to give him my sincere respect. I knew him well: I could candidly transport myself into his
way of looking at these matters. I have never seen a man without his weaknesses; only, in distinguished men they
strike us more. We wish, and will at all rates have it, that persons privileged as they are should at the same time
pay no tribute, no tax whatever. I honoured him as a superior man; and hoped to use the influence of my calm
neutrality to bring about, if not a peace, at least a truce. I know not what my efforts might have done: but God
concluded the affair more briefly, and took the Chaplain to himself. On his coffin all wept, who had lately been
striving with him about words. His uprightness, his fear of God, no one had ever doubted.
I too was, ere long, forced to lay aside this Herrnhut dollwork, which, by means of these contentions, now
appeared before me in a rather different light. Our uncle had, in silence, executed his intentions with my sister. He
offered her a young man of rank and fortune as a bridegroom; and showed, by a rich dowry, what might be
expected of himself. My father joyfully consented; my sister was free and forewarned, she did not hesitate to
Chapter XVI

194

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
change her state. The bridal was appointed at my uncle's castle: family and friends were all invited; and we came
together in the cheerfulest mood.
For the first time in my life, the aspect of a house excited admiration in me. I had often heard of my uncle's taste,
of his Italian architect, of his collections and his library; but, comparing this with what I had already seen, I had
formed a very vague and fluctuating picture of it in my thoughts. Great, accordingly, was my surprise at the
earnest and harmonious impression which I felt on entering the house, and which every hall and chamber
deepened. If elsewhere pomp and decoration had but dissipated my attention, I felt here concentrated and drawn
back upon myself. In like manner, the preparatives for these solemnities and festivals produced a silent pleasure,
by their air of dignity and splendour; and to me it seemed as inconceivable that one man could have invented and
arranged all this, as that one man could have invented and arranged all this, as that more than one could have
worked together in so high a spirit. Yet withal, the landlord and his people were entirely natural; not a trace of
stiffness or of empty form was to be seen.
The wedding itself was managed in a striking way: an exquisite strain of vocal music came upon us by surprise;
and the clergyman went through the ceremony with a singular solemnity. I was standing by Philo at the time; and
instead of a congratulation, he whispered in my ear: "When I saw your sister give away her hand, I felt as if a
stream of boiling water had been poured over me." "Why so?" I inquired. "It is always the way with me," said he,
"when I see two people joined." I laughed at him; but I have often since had cause to recollect his words.
The revel of the party, among whom were many young people, looked particularly glittering and airy, as
everything around us was dignified and serious. The furniture, plate, table−ware and table−ornaments, accorded
with the general whole; and if in other houses you would say the architect was of the school of the confectioner, it
here appeared as if even our confectioner and butler had taken lessons from the architect.
We stayed together several days; and our intelligent and gifted landlord had variedly provided for the
entertainment of his guests. I did not in the present case repeat the melancholy proof, which has so often in my
life been forced upon me, how unhappily a large mixed company are situated, when, altogether left to themselves,
they have to select the most general and vapid pastimes, that the fools of the party may not want amusement,
however it may fare with those that are not such.
My uncle had arranged it altogether differently. Two or three marshals, if I may call them so, had been appointed
by him: one of them had charge of providing entertainment for the young. Dances, excursions, little games, were
of his invention, and under his direction: and as young people take delight in being out of doors, and do not fear
the influences of the air, the garden and garden−hall had been assigned to them; while some additional pavilions
and galleries had been erected and appended to the latter, formed of boards and canvas merely, but in such
proportions, so elegant and noble, they reminded one of nothing but stone and marble. How rare is a festivity, in
which the person who invites the guests feels also it that is his duty to provide for their conveniences and wants of
every kind! Hunting and card parties, short promenades, opportunities for trustful private conversations, were
afforded the elder persons: and whoever wished to go earliest to bed was sure to be lodged the farthest from noise.
By this happy order, the space we lived in appeared to be a little world; and yet, considered narrowly, the castle
was not large; without an accurate knowledge of it, and without the spirit of its owner, it would have been
impossible to entertain so many people here, and quarter each according to his humour.
As the aspect of a well−formed person pleases us, so also does a fair establishment, by means of which the
presence of a rational intelligent mind is manifested. We feel a joy in entering even a cleanly house, though it may
be tasteless in its structure and its decorations; because it shows us the presence of a person cultivated in at least
one sense. Doubly pleasing is it therefore, when from a human dwelling, the spirit of a higher though merely
sensual culture speaks to us.

All this was vividly impressed on my observation at my uncle's castle. I had heard and read much of art; Philo too
was a lover of pictures, and had a fine collection; I myself had often practised drawing: but I had been too deeply
occupied with my emotions striving exclusively after the one thing needful, which alone I was bent on carrying to
perfection; and then such objects of art as I had hitherto seen, appeared, like all other worldly objects, to distract
my thoughts. But now, for the first time, outward things had led me back upon myself: I now first perceived the
difference between the natural charm of the nightingale's song, and that of a four−voice anthem pealed from the
expressive organs of men.
My joy over this discovery I did not hide from my uncle; who, when all the rest were settled at their posts, was
wont to come and talk with me in private. He spoke with great modesty of what he possessed and had produced
here; with great decision, of the views in which it had been gathered and arranged: and I could easily observe that
he spoke with a forbearance towards me; seeming, in his usual way to rate the excellence which he himself
possessed, below that other excellence, which, in my way of thinking, was the best and properest.
"If we can conceive it possible," he once observed, "that the Creator of the world himself assumed the form of his
creature, and lived in that manner for a time upon earth, this creature must appear to us of infinite perfection,
because susceptible of such a combination with its Maker. Hence, in our idea of man there can be no
inconsistency with our idea of God: and if we often feel a certain disagreement with Him and remoteness from
Him, it is but the more on that account our duty, not like advocates of the wicked Spirit, to keep our eyes
continually upon the nakedness and weakness of our nature; but rather to seek out every property and beauty, by
which our pretension to a similarity with the Divinity may be made good."
I smiled and answered: "Do not make me blush, dear uncle, by your complaisance in talking in my language!
What you have to say is of such importance to me, that I wish to hear it in your own most peculiar style; and then
what parts of it I cannot quite appropriate, I will endeavour to translate."
"I may continue," he replied, "in my own most peculiar way, without any alteration of my tone. Man's highest
merit always is, as much as possible to rule external circumstances, and as little as possible to let himself be ruled
by them. Life lies before us, as a huge quarry lies before the architect: he deserves not the name of architect,
except when, out of this fortuitous mass, he can combine, with the greatest economy, and fitness, and durability,
some form, the pattern of which originated in his spirit. All things without us, nay I may add, all things on us, are
mere elements: but deep within us lies the creative force, which out of these can produce what they were meant to
be; and which leaves us neither sleep nor rest, till in one way or another, without us or on us, that same have been
produced. You, my dear niece, have, it may be, chosen the better part: you have striven to bring your moral being,
your earnest lovely nature into accordance with itself and with the Highest: but neither ought we to be blamed,
when we strive to get acquainted with the sentient man in all his comprehensiveness, and to bring about an active
harmony among his powers."
By such discoursing, we in time grew more familiar; and I begged of him to speak with me as with himself,
omitting every sort of condescension. "Do you think," replied my uncle, "that I flatter you, when I commend your
mode of thinking and acting. I reverence the individual who understands distinctly what it is he wishes; who
unweariedly advances, who knows the means conducive to his object, and can seize and use them. How far his
object may be great or little, may merit praise or censure, is the next consideration with me. Believe me, love,
most part of all the misery and mischief, of all that is denominated evil, in the world arises from the fact that men
are too remiss to get a proper knowledge of their aims, and when they do know them, to work intensely in
attaining them. They seem to me like people who have taken up a notion, that they must and will erect a tower,
and who yet expend on the foundation not more stones and labour than would be sufficient for a hut. If you, my
friend, whose highest want it was to perfect and unfold your moral nature, had, instead of those bold and noble
sacrifices, merely trimmed between your duties to yourself and to your family, your bridegroom, or perhaps your
husband, you must have lived in constant contradiction with your feelings, and never could have had a peaceful
moment."
Chapter XVI

"You employ the word sacrifice," I answered here; "and I have often thought that to a higher purpose, as to a
divinity, we offer up, by way of sacrifice, a thing of smaller value; feeling like persons who should willingly and
gladly bring a favourite lamb to the altar for the health of a beloved father."
"Whatever it may be," said he, "reason or feeling, that commands us to give up the one thing for the other, to
choose the one before the other, decision and perseverance are, in my opinion, the noblest qualities of man. You
cannot have the ware and the money both at once: and he who always bankers for the ware without having heart
to give the money for it, is no better off than he who repents him of the purchase when the ware is in his hands.
But I am far from blaming men on this account: it is not they that are to blame; it is the difficult entangled
situation they are in; they know not how to guide themselves in its perplexities. Thus, for instance, you will on the
average find fewer bad economists in the country than in towns, and fewer again in small towns than in great; and
why? Man is intended for a limited condition; objects that are simple, near, determinate, he comprehends, and he
becomes accustomed to employ such means as are at hand: but on entering a wider field, he now knows neither
what he would nor what he should; and it amounts to quite the same, whether his attention is distracted by the
multitude of objects, or is overpowered by their magnitude and dignity. It is always a misfortune for him, when he
is induced to struggle after anything, with which he cannot connect himself by some regular exertion of his
powers.
"Certainly," pursued he, "without earnestness there is nothing to be done in life: yet among the people whom we
name cultivated men, little earnestness is to be found: in labours and employments, in arts, nay even in
recreations, they proceed, if I may say so, with a sort of self−defence; they live, as they read a heap of
newspapers, only to have done with it; they remind one of that young Englishman at Rome, who said, with a
contented air, one evening in some company, that today he had dispatched six churches and two galleries. They
wish to know and learn a multitude of things, and precisely those they have the least concern with; and they never
see that hunger is not stilled by snapping at the air. When I become acquainted with a man, my first inquiry is:
With what does he employ himself, and how, and with what degree of perseverance? The answer regulates the
interest I shall take in him, for life."
"My dear uncle," I replied, "you are perhaps too rigorous, you perhaps withdraw your helping hand from here and
there a worthy man to whom you might be useful."
"Can it be imputed as a fault," said he, "to one who has so long and vainly laboured on them and about them?
How much we have to suffer, in our youth, from men who think they are inviting us to a delightful
pleasure−party, when they undertake to introduce us to the Danaides or Sisyphus! Heaven be praised! I have rid
myself of these people: if one of them unfortunately comes within my sphere, I forth with, in the politest manner,
compliment him out again. It is from such persons that you hear the bitterest complaints about the miserable
course of things, the aridity of science, the levity of artists, the emptiness of poets, and much more of that sort.
They do not recollect that they, and the many like them, are the very persons who would never read a book which
had been written just as they require it; that true poetry is alien to them; that even an excellent work of art can
never gain their approbation, except by means of prejudice. But let us now break off; for this is not the time to rail
or to complain."
He directed my attention to the different pictures hanging on the wall: my eye dwelt on those whose look was
beautiful or subject striking. This he permitted for a while; at last he said: "Bestow a little notice on the spirit
manifested in these other works. Good minds delight to trace the finger of the Deity in nature: why not likewise
pay some small regard to the hand of his imitator?" He then led my observation to some unobtrusive figures;
endeavouring to make me understand, that it was the history of art alone which could give us an idea of the worth
and dignity of any work of art; that we should know the weary steps of mere handicraft and mechanism, over
which the man of talents has struggled in the course of centuries, before we can conceive how it is possible for the
man of genius to move with airy freedom, on the pinnacle whose very aspect makes us giddy.

Chapter XVI

With this view he had formed a beautiful series of works; and whilst he explained it, I could not help conceiving
that I saw before me a similitude of moral culture. When I expressed my thought to him, he answered:
You are altogether right; and we see from this, that those do not act well, who, in a solitary exclusive manner,
follow moral cultivation by itself. On the contrary, it will be found that he whose spirit strives for a development
of that kind, has likewise every reason, at the same time, to improve his finer sentient powers; that so he may not
run the risk of sinking from his moral height, by giving way to the enticements of a lawless fancy, and degrading
his moral nature by allowing it to take delight in tasteless baubles, if not in something worse."
I did not suspect him of levelling at me; but I felt myself struck, when I reflected how many insipidities there
might be in the songs that used to edify me; and how little favour the figures, which had joined themselves to my
religious ideas, would have found in the eyes of my uncle.
Philo, in the mean time, had frequently been busied in the library: he now took me along with him. We admired
the selection, as well as the multitude of books. They had been collected on my uncle's general principle; there
were none to be found among them but such as either lead to correct knowledge, or teach right arrangement; such
as either give us fit materials, or further the concordance of our spirit.
In the course of my life I had read very largely; in certain branches, there was almost no work unknown to me: the
more pleasant was it here, to speak about the general survey of the whole; to mark deficiencies, and not, as
elsewhere, see nothing but a hampered confusion or a boundless expansion.
Here too we became acquainted with a very interesting, quiet man. He was a physician and a naturalist; he seemed
rather one of the Penates than of the inmates. He showed us the museum, which like the library was fixed in
glasscases to the walls of the chambers; adorning and ennobling the space, which it did not crowd. On this
occasion, I recalled with joy the days of my youth; and showed my father many of the things he had been wont to
lay upon the sick−bed of his little child, just opening its little eyes to look into the world then. At the same time,
the Physician, in our present and following conversations, did not scruple to avow how near he approximated to
me in respect of my religious sentiments: he warmly praised my uncle for his tolerance, and his esteem of all that
testified or forwarded the worth and unity of human nature; admitting also, that he called for a similar return from
others, and would shun and condemn nothing else so heartily as individual pretension and narrow exclusiveness.
Since the nuptials of my sister, joy had sparkled in the eyes of our uncle: he often spoke with me of what he
meant to do for her and for her children. He had several fine estates; he managed them himself, and hoped to
leave them in the best condition to his nephews. Regarding the small estate, where we at present were, he
appeared to entertain peculiar thoughts. "I will leave it to none," said he, "but to a person who can understand and
value and enjoy what it contains, and who feels how loudly every man of wealth and rank, especially in Germany,
is called on to exhibit something like a model to others".
Most of his guests were now gone; we too were making ready for departure, thinking we had seen the final scene
of this solemnity; when his attention in affording us some dignified enjoyment produced a new surprise. We had
mentioned to him the delight which the chorus of voices, suddenly commencing without accompaniment of any
instrument, had given us, at my sister's marriage. We hinted, at the same time, how pleasant it would be were such
a thing repeated: but he seemed to pay no heed to us. The livelier was our surprise, when he said one evening:
"The music of the dance has died away; our transitory, youthful friends have left us; the happy pair themselves
have a more serious look than they had some days ago; to part at such a time, when perhaps we shall never meet
again, certainly never without changes, exalts us to a solemn mood, which I know not how to entertain more
nobly than by the music you were lately signifying a desire to have repeated."
The chorus, which had in the mean while gathered strength, and by secret practice more expertness, was
accordingly made sing to us a series of four and of eight voiced melodies, which, if I may say so, gave a real
Chapter XVI

198

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
foretaste of bliss. Till then, I had only known the pious mode of singing, as good souls practise it, frequently with
hoarse pipes, imagining, like wild birds, that they are praising God, while they procure a pleasant feeling to
themselves. Or perhaps I had listened to the vain music of concerts, in which you are at best invited to admire the
talent of the singer, and very seldom have even a transient enjoyment. Now, however, I was listening to music,
which, as it originated in the deepest feeling of the most accomplished human beings, was, by suitable and
practised organs in harmonious unity, made again to address the deepest and best feelings of man, and to impress
him at that moment with a lively sense of his likeness to the Deity. They were all devotional songs, in the Latin
language: they sat like jewels in the golden ring of a polished intellectual conversation; and without pretending to
edify, they elevated me and made me happy in the most spiritual manner.
At our departure, he presented all of us with handsome gifts. To me he gave the cross of my order, more
beautifully and artfully worked and enamelled than I had ever seen it before. It was hung upon a large brilliant, by
which also it was fastened to the chain: this he gave me, he said, "as the noblest stone in the cabinet of a
collector."
My sister with her husband went to their estates: the rest of us to our abodes; appearing to ourselves, so far as
outward circumstances were concerned, to have returned to quite an everyday existence. We had been, as it were,
dropped from a palace of the fairies down upon the common earth; and were again obliged to help ourselves as
we best could.
The singular experiences, which this new circle had afforded, left a fine impression on my mind. This, however,
did not long continue in its first vivacity; though my uncle tried to nourish and renew it, by sending me certain of
his best and most pleasing works of art; changing them, from time to time, with others which I had not seen.
I had seen so much accustomed to be busied with myself, in regulating the concerns of my heart and temper, and
conversing on these matters with persons of a like mind, that I could not long study any work of art attentively
without being turned by it back upon myself. I was used to look at a picture or copperplate merely as at the letters
of a book.
Fine printing pleases well: but who would read a book for the beauty of the printing? In like manner, I required of
each pictorial form that it should tell me something, should instruct, affect, improve me: and after all my uncle's
letters to expound his works of art, say what he would, I continued in my former humour.
Yet not only my peculiar disposition, but external incidents and changes in our family still farther drew me back
from contemplations of that nature, nay for some time even from myself. I had to suffer and to do, more than my
slender strength seemed fit for.
My maiden sister had till now been as a right arm to me. Healthy, strong, unspeakably good−natured, she had
managed all the housekeeping, I myself being busied with the personal nursing of our aged father. She was seized
with a catarrh, which changed to a disorder of the lungs; in three weeks she was lying in her coffin. Her death
inflicted wounds on me, the scars of which I am not yet willing to examine.
I was lying sick before they buried her: the old ailment in my breast appeared to be awakening; I coughed with
violence, and was so hoarse, I could not speak beyond a whisper.
My married sister, out of fright and grief, was brought to bed before her time. Our old father thought he was about
to lose at once his children and the hope of their posterity: his natural tears increased my sorrow; I prayed to God
that he would give me back a sufferable state of health. I asked him but to spare my life till my father should die. I
recovered; I was what I reckoned well; being able to discharge my duties, though with pain.

Chapter XVI

My sister was again with child. Many cares, which in such cases are committed to the mother, in the present
instance fell to me. She was not altogether happy with her husband; this was to be hidden from our father: I was
often made judge of their disputes; in which I could decide with the greater safety, as my brother trusted in me,
and the two were really worthy persons, only each of them, instead of humouring, endeavored to convince the
other; and out of eagerness to live in constant harmony, never could agree. I now learned to mingle seriously in
worldly matters, and to practise what of old I had but sung.
My sister bore a son: the frailty of my father did not hinder him from travelling to her. The sight of the child
exceedingly enlivened and cheered him; at the christening, contrary to his custom, he seemed as if inspired; nay I
might say, like a Genius with two faces. With the one, he looked joyfully forward to those regions which he soon
hoped to enter; with the other, to the new hopeful, earthly life which had arisen in the boy descended from him.
On our journey home, he never wearied talking to me of the child, its form, its health, and his wish that the gifts
of this new denizen of earth might be rightly cultivated. His reflections on the subject lasted when we had arrived
at home: it was not till some days afterwards, that I observed a kind of fever in him; which displayed itself,
without shivering, in a sort of languid heat commencing after dinner. He did not yield, however; he went out as
usual in the mornings, faithfully attending to the duties of his office, till at last continuous serious symptoms kept
him within doors.
I never shall forget with what distinctness, clearness and repose of mind, he settled in the greatest order the
concerns of his house, nay the arrangements of his funeral, as he would have done a business of some other
person.
With a cheerfulness, which he never used to show, and which now mounted to a lively joy, he said to me: "Where
is the fear of death which I once felt? Shall I shrink at departing? I have a gracious God; the grave awakens no
terror in me; I have an eternal life."
To recall the circumstances of his death, which shortly followed, forms one of the most pleasing entertainments of
my solitude: the visible workings of a higher Power in that solemn time, no one shall ever argue from me.
The death of my beloved father altogether changed my mode of life. From the strictest obedience, the narrowest
confinement, I passed at once into the greatest freedom; I enjoyed it like a sort of food from which one has long
abstained. Formerly I very seldom spent two hours from home; now I very seldom lived a day there. My friends,
whom I had been allowed to visit only by hurried snatches, wished now to have my company without
interruption, as I did to have theirs. I was often asked to dinner; at walks and pleasure−jaunts I never failed. But
when once the circle had been fairly run, I saw that the invaluable happiness of liberty consisted, not in doing
what one pleases and what circumstances may invite to, but in being able, without hindrance or restraint, to do in
the direct way what one regards as right and proper; and in this instance, I was old enough to reach a valuable
truth, without smarting for my ignorance.
One pleasure I could not deny myself: it was, as soon as might be, to renew and strengthen my connexion with the
Herrnhut Brethren. I hastened, accordingly, to visit one of their establishments at no great distance: but here I by
no means found what I had been anticipating. I was frank enough to signify my disappointment, which they tried
to soften by alleging that the present settlement was nothing to a full and fitly organised Community. This I did
not take upon me to deny; yet in my thought, the genuine spirit of the matter might have displayed itself in a small
body as well as in a great one.
One of their Bishops who was present, a personal disciple of the Count, took considerable pains with me. He
spoke English Perfectly, and as I too understood a little of it, he reckoned this a token that we both belonged to
one class. I, however, reckoned nothing of the Kind; his conversation did not in the least satisfy me. He had been
a cutler; was a native of Moravia: his mode of thought still savoured of the artisan. With Herr Von L, who had
been a Major in the French service, I got upon a better footing: yet I could never bring myself to the
Chapter XVI

200

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
submissiveness he showed to his superiors; nay I felt as if you had given me a box on the ear, when I saw the
Major's wife, and other women more or less like ladies, take the Bishop's hand and Kiss it. Meanwhile, a journey
into Holland was proposed; which, however, doubtless for my good, did not take place.
About this time, my sister was delivered of a daughter; and now it was the turn of us women to exult and consider
how the little creature should be bred like one of us. The husband, on the other hand, was not so satisfied, when in
the following year another daughter saw the light: with his large estates, he wanted to have boys about him, who
in future might assist him in his management.
My health was feeble: I kept myself in peace, and, by a quiet mode of life, in tolerable equilibrium. I was not
afraid of death; nay I wished to die; yet I secretly perceived that God was granting time for me to prove my soul,
and to advance still nearer to himself. In my many sleepless nights, especially, I have at times felt something
which I cannot undertake to describe.
It was as if my soul were thinking separately from the body: she looked upon the body as a foreign substance, as
we look upon a garment. She pictured with extreme vivacity events and times long past, and felt by means of this,
events that were to follow. Those times are all gone by; what follows likewise will go by; the body too will fall to
pieces like a vesture; but I, the well−known I, I am.
The thought is great, exalted and consoling; yet an excellent friend, with whom I every day became more
intimate, instructed me to dwell on it as little as I could. This was the Physician whom I met in my uncle's house,
and who had since accurately informed himself about the temper of my body and my spirit. He showed me how
much these feelings, when we cherish them within us independently of outward objects, tend as it were to
excavate us, and to undermine the whole foundation of our being. "To be active," he would say, "is the primary
vocation of man; all the intervals in which he is obliged to rest, he should employ in gaining clearer knowledge of
external things, for this will in its turn facilitate activity."
This friend was acquainted with my custom of looking on my body as an outward object; he knew also that I
pretty well understood my constitution, my disorder, and the medicines of use for it; nay that by continual
sufferings of my own or other people's, I had really grown a kind of half doctor: he now carried forward my
attention from the human body, and the drugs which act upon it, to the kindred objects of creation: he led me up
and down as in the Paradise of the First Man; only, if I may continue my comparison, allowing me to trace, in dim
remoteness, the Creator walking in the Garden in the cool of the evening.
How gladly did I now see God in nature, when I bore him with such certainty within my heart! How interesting to
me was his handiwork; how thankful did I feel that he had pleased to quicken me with the breath of his mouth!
We again had hopes that my sister would present us with a boy; her husband waited anxiously for that event, but
did not live to see it. He died in consequence of an unlucky fall from horseback; and my sister followed him, soon
after she had brought into the world a lovely boy. The four orphans they had left I could not look at but with
sadness. So many healthy people had been called away before poor sickly me; might I not also have blights to
witness among these fair and hopeful blossoms? I knew the world sufficiently to understand what dangers
threaten the precarious breeding of a child, especially a child of quality; and it seemed as if, since the period of
my youth, these dangers had increased. I felt that weakly as I was, I could not be of much, perhaps of any service
to the little ones; and I rejoiced the more on finding that my uncle, as indeed might have been looked for, had
determined to devote his whole attention to the education of these amiable creatures. And this they doubtless
merited in every sense; they were handsome, and with great diversities, all promised to be well−conditioned,
reasonable persons.
Since my worthy Doctor had suggested it, I loved to trace out family likenesses among our relatives and children.
My father had carefully preserved the portraits of his ancestors, and got his own and those of his descendants
Chapter XVI

201

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
drawn by tolerable masters; nor had my mother and her people been forgotten. We accurately knew the characters
of all the family; and as we had frequently compared them with each other, we now endeavoured to discover in
the children the same peculiarities outward or inward. My sister's elder son, we thought, resembled his paternal
grandfather, of whom there was a fine youthful picture in my uncle's collection: he had been a brave soldier; and
in this point too the boy took after him, liking arms above all things, and busying himself with them whenever he
paid me a visit. For my father had left a very pretty armory; and the boy got no rest till I had given him a pair of
pistols and a fowling−piece, and he had learned the proper way of using them. At the same time, in his conduct or
bearing there was nothing like rudeness: far from that, he was always meek and sensible.
The elder daughter had attracted my especial love; of which perhaps the reason was that she resembled me, and of
all the four seemed to like me best. But I may well admit that the more closely I observed her as she grew, the
more she shamed me: I could not look on her without a sentiment of admiration, nay I may almost say, of
reverence. You would scarcely have seen a nobler form, a more peaceful spirit, an activity so equable and
universal. No moment of her life was she unoccupied; and every occupation in her hands became dignified. All
seemed indifferent to her, so that she could but accomplish what was proper in the place and time; and in the same
manner, she could patiently continue unemployed, when there was nothing to be done. This activity without need
of occupation, I have never elsewhere met with. In particular, her conduct to the suffering and destitute was, from
her earliest youth, inimitable. For my part, I freely confess I never had the gift to make a business of beneficence:
I was not niggardly to the poor; nay I often gave too largely for my means; yet this was little more than buying
myself off; and a person needed to be made for me, if I was to bestow attention on him. Directly the reverse was
the conduct of my niece. I never saw her give a poor man money; whatever she obtained from me for this
purpose, she failed not in the first place to change for some necessary article. Never did she seem more lovely in
my eyes than when rummaging my clothes−presses: she was always sure to light on something which I did not
wear and did not need: to sew these old cast articles together, and put them on some ragged child, she thought her
highest happiness.
Her sister's turn of mind appeared already different: she had much of her mother; she promised to become very
elegant and beautiful, and she now bids fair to keep her promise. She is greatly taken up with her exterior; from
her earliest years she could decorate and carry herself in a way that struck you.
I still remember with what ecstasy, when quite a little creature, she saw herself in a mirror, decked in certain
precious pearls, once my mother's, which she had by chance discovered, and made me try upon her.
Reflecting on these diverse inclinations, it was pleasant for me to consider how my property would, after my
decease, be shared among them, and again called into use. I saw the fowling−pieces of my father once more
travelling round the fields on my nephew's shoulder, and birds once more falling from his hunting−pouch: I saw
my whole wardrobe issuing from the church, at Easter Confirmation, on the persons of tidy little girls; while the
best pieces of it were employed to decorate some virtuous burgher maiden on her marriage−day. In furnishing
such children and poor little girls, Natalia had a singular delight; though, as I must here remark, she showed not
the smallest love, or if I may say it, smallest need of a dependence upon any visible or invisible Being, such as I
had in my youth so strongly manifested.
When I also thought that the younger sister, on that same day, would wear my jewels and pearls at court, I could
see with peace my possessions, like my body, given back to the elements.
The children waxed apace: to my comfort, they are healthy, handsome, clever creatures. That my uncle keeps
them from me, I endure without repining: when staying in the neighbourhood, or even in town, they seldom see
me.
A singular personage, regarded as a French clergyman, though no one rightly knows his history, has been
intrusted with the oversight of all these children. He has them taught in various places; they are put to board now

here, now there.
At first I could perceive no plan whatever in this mode of education; till at last our Doctor told me the Abbé had
convinced my uncle, that in order to accomplish anything by education, we must first become acquainted with the
pupil's tendencies and wishes; that these once ascertained, he ought to be transported to a situation where he may,
as speedily as possible, content the former and attain the latter; and so if he have been mistaken, may still in time
perceive his error; and at last having found what suits him, may hold the faster by it, may the more diligently
fashion himself according to it. I wish this strange experiment may prosper: with such excellent natures it is
perhaps possible.
But there is one peculiarity in these instructors, which I never shall approve of: they study to seclude the children
from whatever might awaken them to an acquaintance with themselves and with the invisible, sole, faithful
Friend. I often take it ill of my uncle that, on this account, he considers me dangerous for the little ones. Thus in
practice there is no man tolerant! Many assure us that they willingly leave each to take his own way; yet all
endeavour to exclude from action every one that does not think as they do.
This removal of the children troubles me the more, the more I am convinced of the reality of my belief. How can
it fail to have a heavenly origin, an actual object, when in practice it is so effectual? Is it not by practice alone that
we prove our own existence? Why then may we not, by a like mode, prove to ourselves the influence of that
Power who gives us all good things? That I am still advancing, never retrograding; that my conduct is
approximating more and more to the image I have formed of perfection; that I every day feel more facility in
doing what I reckon proper, even while the weakness of my body so obstructs me: can all this be accounted for
upon the principles of human nature, whose corruption I have so clearly seen into? For me, at least, it cannot.
I scarcely remember a commandment; to me there is nothing that assumes the aspect of law; it is an impulse that
leads me, and guides me always aright. I freely follow my emotions, and know as little of constraint as of
repentance. God be praised that I know to whom I am indebted for such happiness, and that I cannot think of it
without humility! There is no danger I should ever become proud of what I myself can do or can forbear to do; I
have seen too well what a monster might be formed and nursed in every human bosom, did not higher Influence
restrain us.

Book VII
Chapter I
THE SPRING had commenced in all its brilliancy; a storm, that had been lowering all day, went fiercely down
upon the hills; the rain drew back into the country; the sun came forth in all its splendour, and upon the dark
vapour rose the lordly rainbow. Wilhelm was riding towards it: the sight made him sad. "Ah!" said he within
himself, 'do the fairest hues of life appear, then, only on a ground of black? And must drops fall, if we are to be
charmed? A bright day is like a dim one, if we look at it unmoved; and what can move us but some silent hope
that the inborn inclination of our soul shall not always be without an object? The recital of a noble action moves
us; the sight of everything harmonious moves us: we feel then as if we were not altogether in a foreign land; we
fancy we are nearer the home, towards which our best and inmost wishes impatiently strive."
Meanwhile a pedestrian overtook him, and walking with a stout step by the side of the horse, began to keep him
company. After a few common words, he looked at the rider and said: "If I am not mistaken, I must have already
seen you somewhere."
"I too remember you," said Wilhelm: "had we not some time ago a pleasant sail together?" "Right!" replied the
other.

Wilhelm looked at him more narrowly; then, after a pause, observed: "I do not know what alteration has occurred
in you; last time we met, I took you for a Lutheran clergyman, you now seem rather like a Catholic one."
"Today at least you are not wrong," replied the other, taking off his hat and showing him the tonsure. "Where is
your company gone? Did you stay long with them?"
"Longer than was good; on looking back upon the period which I passed in their society, it seems as if I looked
into an endless void; nothing of it has remained with me."
"Here you are mistaken," said the stranger; "everything that happens to us leaves some trace behind it, everything
contributes imperceptibly to form us. Yet often it is dangerous to take a strict account of that. For either we grow
proud and negligent, or downcast and dispirited; and both are equally injurious in their consequences. The safe
plan is, always simply to do the task that lies nearest us; and this in the present case," added he with a smile, "is to
hasten to our quarters."
Wilhelm asked how far Lothario's house was distant; the stranger answered that it lay behind the hill. "Perhaps I
shall meet you there," continued he; "I have merely a small affair to manage in the neighourhood. Farewell till
then!" And with this, he struck into a steep path, that seemed to lead more speedily across the hill.
"Yes, the man is right!" said Wilhelm to himself as he proceeded; "we should think of what is nearest: and for me
at present there is nothing nearer than the mournful errand I have come to do. Let me see whether I can still repeat
the speech, which is to put that cruel man to shame."
He then began reciting to himself this piece of oratory: not a syllable was wanting; and the more his recollection
served him, the higher grew his passion and his courage. Aurelia's sorrows and her death were vividly present to
his soul.
"Spirit of my friend!" exclaimed he, "hover round me; and if thou canst, give some sign to me that thou art
softened, art appeased!"
Amid such words and meditations, he had reached the summit of the hill; and near the foot of its declivity, he now
beheld a curious building, which he at once took to be Lothario's dwelling. An old irregular castle, with several
turrets and peaked roofs, appeared to have been the primitize erection; but the new additions to it, placed near the
main structure, looked still more irregular. A part of them stood close upon the main edifice; others, at some
distance, were combined with it by galleries and covered passages. All external symmetry, every shade of
architectural beauty, appeared to have been sacrificed to the convenience of the interior. No trace of wall or trench
was to be seen; none of avenues or artificial gardens. A fruit and potherb garden reached to the very buildings;
and little patches of a like sort showed themselves even in the intermediate spaces. A cheerful village lay at no
great distance: the fields and gardens everywhere appeared in the highest state of cultivation.
Sunk in his own impassioned feelings, Wilhelm rode along, not thinking much of what he saw: he put up his
horse at an inn; and not without emotion, hastened to the Castle.
An old serving−man received him at the door; and signified, with much good−nature, that today it would be
difficult to get admission to his Lordship; who was occupied in writing letters, and had already refused some
people that had business with him. Our friend became more importunate; the old man was at last obliged to yield,
and announce him. He returned, and conducted Wilhelm to a spacious ancient hall; desiring him to be so good as
wait, since perhaps it might be some time before his Lordship could appear. Our friend walked up and down
unrestfully; casting now and then a look at the knights and dames, whose ancient figures hung round him on the
walls. He repeated the beginning of his speech: it seemed, in presence of these ruffs and coats of mail, to answer
even better. Every time there rose any stir, he put himself in posture to receive his man with dignity; meaning first
Book VII

204

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
to hand him the letter, then assail him with the weapons of reproach.
More than once mistaken, he was now beginning to be really vexed and out of tune, when at last a handsome man,
in boots and light surtout, stept in from a side−door. "What good news have you for me?" said he to Wilhelm,
with a friendly voice; "pardon me, that I have made you wait."
So speaking, he kept folding a letter, which he held in his hand. Wilhelm, not without embarrassment, delivered
him Aurelia's paper, and replied: "I bring you the last words of a friend, which you will not read without
emotion."
Lothario took it, and returned to his chamber with it; where, as Wilhelm through the open door could very easily
observe, he addressed and sealed some letters, before opening Aurelia's. He appeared to have perused it once or
twice; and Wilhelm, though his feelings signified that the pathetic speech would sort but ill with such a cool
reception, girded up his mind, went forward to the threshold, and was just about beginning his address, when a
tapestry door of the cabinet opened, and the clergyman came in.
"I have got the strangest message you can think of," cried Lothario to him. "Pardon me," continued he, addressing
Wilhelm, "if I am not in a mood for speaking farther with you at this moment. You remain with us tonight: you,
Abbé, see the stranger properly attended to."
With these words, he made his guest a bow: the clergyman took Wilhelm by the hand, who followed, not without
reluctance.
They walked along some curious passages, in silence, and at last reached a very pretty chamber. The Abbé led
him in; then left him, making no excuses. Ere long, an active boy appeared; he introduced himself as Wilhelm's
valet; and brought up his supper. In waiting, he had much to say about the order of the house, about their
breakfasting and dining, labours and amusements; interspersing many things in commendation of Lothario.
Pleasant as the boy was, Wilhelm endeavoured to get rid of him as soon as possible. He wished to be alone; for he
felt exceedingly oppressed and straitened, in his new position. He reproached himself with having executed his
intentions so ill, with having done his errand only half. One moment, he proposed to overtake next morning what
he had neglected tonight; the next, he saw that by Lothario's presence he would be attuned to quite a different set
of feelings. The house, too, where he was, seemed very strange to him: he could not be at home in his position.
Intending to undress, he opened his travelling−bag: with his night−clothes, he took out the Spirit's veil, which
Mignon had packed in along with them. The sight of it increased the sadness of his humour. "Fly! youth, fly!"
cried he: "What means this mystic word? What am I to fly, or whither? It were better had the Spirit called to me:
Return to thyself!" He cast his eyes on some English copperplates, hung round the room in frames; most of them
he looked at with indifference: at last he met with one, in which a ship was represented sinking in a tempest; a
father with his lovely daughters was awaiting death from the intrusive billows. One of the maidens had a kind of
likeness to the Amazon: an indescribable compassion seized our friend; he felt an irresistible necessity to vent his
feelings; tears filled his eyes, he wept, and did not recover his composure, till slumber overpowered him.
Strange dreams arose upon him towards morning. He was in a garden, which in boyhood he had often visited; he
looked with pleasure at the well−known alleys, hedges, flowerbeds: Mariana met him, he spoke to her with love
and tenderness, recollecting nothing of any bygone grievance. Ere long his father joined them, in his week−day
dress; with a look of frankness that was rare in him, he bade his son fetch two seats from the garden−house; then
took Mariana by the hand, and led her into a grove.
Wilhelm hastened to the garden−house, but found it altogether empty; only at a window in the farther side he saw
Aurelia standing. He went forward and addressed her, but she turned not round; and though he placed himself
beside her, he could never see her face. He looked out from the window; in an unknown garden, there were
Book VII

205

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
several people, some of whom he recognised. Frau Melina, seated under a tree was playing with a rose, which she
had in her hand; Laertes stood beside her, counting money from the one hand to the other. Mignon and Felix were
lying on the grass; the former on her back, the latter on his face. Philina came and clapped her hands above the
children; Mignon lay unmoved; Felix started up and fled. At first he laughed while running, as Philina followed:
but he screamed in terror, when he saw the Harper coming after him with large, slow steps. Felix ran directly to a
pond; Wilhelm hastened after him: too late; the child was lying in the water! Wilhelm stood as if rooted to the
spot. The fair Amazon appeared on the other side of the pond; she stretched her right hand towards the child, and
walked along the shore. The child came through the water, by the course her finger pointed to; he followed her as
she went round; at last she reached her hand to him, and pulled him out. Wilhelm had come nearer: the child was
all in flames; fiery drops were falling from his body. Wilhelm's agony was greater than ever; but instantly the
Amazon took a white veil from her head, and covered up the child with it. The fire was at once quenched. But
when she lifted up the veil, two boys sprang out from under it, and frolicsomely sported to and fro; while Wilhelm
and the Amazon proceeded hand in hand across the garden; and noticed in the distance Mariana and his father
walking in an alley, which was formed of lofty trees, and seemed to go quite round the garden. He turned his steps
to them, and with his beautiful attendant was moving through the garden, when suddenly the fair−haired Friedrich
came across their path, and kept them back with loud laughter and a thousand tricks. Still, however, they insisted
on proceeding; and Friedrich hastened off, running towards Mariana and the father. These seemed to fly before
him; he pursued the faster; till Wilhelm saw them hovering down the alley almost as on wings. Nature and
inclination called on him to go, and help them; but the hand of the Amazon detained him. How gladly did he let
himself be held! With this mingled feeling he awoke; and found his chamber shining with the morning beams.

Chapter II
OUR friend was called to breakfast by the boy: he found the Abbé waiting in the hall; Lothario, it appeared, had
ridden out. The Abbé was not very talkative, but rather wore a thoughtful look; he inquired about Aurelia's death,
and listened to our friend's recital of it, with apparent sympathy. "Ah!" cried he, "the man that discerns, with
lively clearness, what infinite operations art and nature must have joined in, before a cultivated human being can
be formed; the man that himself as much as possible takes interest in the culture of his fellowmen, is ready to
despair when he sees how lightly mortals will destroy themselves, will blamelessly or blameably expose
themselves to be destroyed. When I think of these things, life itself appears to me so uncertain a gift, that I could
praise the man who does not value it beyond its worth."
Scarcely had he spoken, when the door flew violently up; a young lady came rushing in; she pushed away the old
servant who attempted to restrain her. She made right to the Abbé, and seized him by the arm; her tears and sobs
would hardly let her speak these words: "Where is he? Where have you put him? 'Tis a frightful treachery!
Confess it now! I know what you are doing: I will after him; will Know where you have sent him!"
"Be calm, my child," replied the Abbé, with assumed composure; "come with me to your room; you shall know it
all; only you must have the strength to listen, if you ask me to relate." He offered her his hand, as if he meant to
lead her out. "I will not return to my room," cried she: "I hate the walls where you have kept me prisoner so long.
I know it all already: the Colonel has challenged him; he is gone to meet his enemy; perhaps this very moment
he−Once or twice I thought I heard the sound of shots! I tell you, order out a coach, and come along with me, or I
will fill the house and all the village with my screaming."
Weeping bitterly, she hastened to the window; the Abbé held her back, and sought in vain to soothe her.
They heard a sound of wheels: she threw up the window, exclaiming: "He is dead! They are bringing home his
body." "He is coming out," replied Abbé "you perceive he lives." "He is wounded," said she wildly, "else he
would have come on horseback. They are holding him! The wound is dangerous!" She ran to the door, and down
the stairs: the Abbé hastened after her; and Wilhelm following, observed the fair one meet her lover, who had now
Chapter II

206

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
dismounted.
Lothario leaned on his attendant, whom Wilhelm at once knew as his ancient patron Jarno. The wounded man
spoke very tenderly and kindly to the tearful damsel; he rested on her shoulder, and came slowly up the steps;
saluted Wilhelm as he passed, and was conducted to his cabinet.
Jarno soon returned, and going up to Wilhelm, "It appears," said he, "you are predestined everywhere to find a
theatre and actors. We have here commenced a play which is not altogether pleasant."
"I rejoice to find you," answered Wilhelm, "in so strange an hour: I am astonished, frightened; and your presence
already quiets my mind. Tell me, is there danger? Is the Baron badly wounded?" "I imagine not," said Jarno.
It was not long till the young surgeon entered from the cabinet. "Now what say you?" cried Jarno to him. "That it
is a dangerous piece of work," replied the other, putting several instruments into his leathern pouch. Wilhelm
looked at the band, which was hanging from the pouch; he fancied he knew it. Bright contrary colours, a curious
pattern, gold and silver wrought in singular figures, marked this band from all the bands in the world. Wilhelm
was convinced he beheld the very pouch of the ancient surgeon, who had dressed his wounds in the green of the
forest; and the hope, so long deferred, of again finding traces of the lovely Amazon, struck like a flame through
all his soul.
"Where did you get that pouch?" cried he. "To whom did it belong before you? I beg of you, tell me." "I bought it
at an auction," said the other: "what is it to me, whom it belonged to?" So speaking, he went out; and Jarno said:
"If there would come but one word of truth from our young Doctor's mouth!" "Then he did not buy the pouch?"
said Wilhelm. "Just as little as Lothario is in danger," said the other.
Wilhelm stood immersed in many reflections; Jarno asked how he had fared of late. Wilhelm sketched an outline
of his history; and when he at last came to speak of Aurelia's death, and his message to the place, his auditor
exclaimed: "Well! it is strange, most strange!"
The Abbé entered from Lothario's chamber; beckoned Jarno to go in instead of him; and said to Wilhelm: "The
Baron bids me ask you to remain with us a day or two, to share his hospitality, and, in the present circumstances,
contribute to his solacement. If you need to give any notice to your people, your letter shall be instantly
dispatched. Meanwhile, to make you understand this curious incident, of which you have been witness, I must tell
you something, which indeed is no secret. The Baron had a small adventure with a lady, which excited more than
usual attention; the lady having taken him from a rival, and wishing to enjoy her victory too ostentatiously. After
a time, he no longer found the same delight in her society; which he of course forsook: but being of a violent
temper, she could not bear her fate with patience. Meeting at a ball, they had an open quarrel: she thought herself
irreparably injured; and would be revenged. No knight stept forth to do battle for her; till her husband, whom for
years she had not lived with, heard of the affair and took it up. He challenged the Baron, and today he has
wounded him; yet, as I hear, the gallant Colonel has himself come still worse off."
From this hour, our friend was treated in the house as if he had belonged to it.

Chapter III
AT times they had read a little to the patient; Wilhelm joyfully performed this service. Lydia stirred not from
Lothario's bed; her care for him absorbed her whole attention. But today the patient himself seemed occupied with
thought: he bade them lay aside their book. "Today," said he, "I feel through my whole heart how foolishly we let
our time pass on. How many things have I proposed to do, how many have I planned; yet how we loiter in our
noblest purposes! I have just read over the scheme of the changes which I mean to make in my estates: and it is
Chapter III

207

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
chiefly, I may say, on their account that I rejoice at the bullet's not having gone a deadlier road."
Lydia looked at him with tenderness, with tears in her eyes; as if to ask if she, if his friends could not pretend to
any interest in his wish to live. Jarno answered: "Changes, such as you project, require to be considered well on
every side, before they are resolved on."
"Long considerations," said Lothario, "are commonly a proof that we have not the point to be determined clearly
in our eye; precipitate proceedings that we do not know it. I see distinctly that in managing my property, there are
several particulars, in which the services of my dependants cannot be remitted; certain rights which I must rigidly
insist on: but I also see that there are other articles, advantageous to me, but by no means indispensable, which
might admit of relaxation. Do I not profit by my lands far better than my father did? Is not my income still
increasing? And shall I alone enjoy this growing benefit? Shall not those who labour with and for me partake, in
their degree, of the advantages which expanding knowledge, which a period of improvement are procuring for
us?"
"'Tis human nature!" cried Jarno: "I do not blame myself when I detect this selfish quality among the rest. Every
man desires to gather all things round him, to shape and manage them according to his own pleasure: the money
which he himself does not expend, he seldom reckons well expended."
"Certainly," observed Lothario, "much of the capital might be abated, if we consumed the interest less
capriciously."
"The only thing I shall mention," said the other, "the only reason I can urge against your now proceeding with
those alterations, which, for a time at least, must cause you loss, is, that you yourself are still in debt, and that the
payment presses hard on you. My advice is, therefore, to postpone your plan till you are altogether free."
"And in the mean while leave it at the mercy of a bullet, or the fall of a tile, to annihilate the whole result of my
existence and activity! O my friend! it is ever thus; it is ever the besetting fault of cultivated men, that they wish
to spend their whole resources on some idea, scarcely any part of them on tangible existing objects. Why was it
that I contracted debts, that I quarrelled with my uncle, that I left my sisters to themselves so long? Purely for the
sake of an idea.
"In America, I fancied I might accomplish something; over seas, I hoped to become useful and essential: if any
task was not begirt with a thousand dangers, I considered it trivial, unworthy of me. How differently do matters
now appear! How precious, how important seems the duty which is nearest me, whatever it may be!"
"I recollect the letter which you sent me from the Western world," said Jarno: "it contained the words: 'I will
return, and in my house, amid my fields, among my people, I will say: Here or nowhere is America!"'
"Yes, my friend! and I am still repeating it, and still repining at myself that I am not so busy here as I was there.
For certain equable, continuous modes of life, there is nothing more than judgment necessary, and we study to
attain nothing more; so that we become unable to discern what extraordinary services each vulgar day requires of
us; or if we do discern them, we find abundance of excuses for not doing them. A judicious man is valuable to
himself; but of little value for the general whole."
"We will not," said Jarno, "bear too hard upon judgment: let us grant that whenever extraordinary things are done,
they are generally foolish."
"Yes! and just because they are not done according to the proper plan. My brother−in−law, you see, is giving up
his fortune, so far as in his power, to the Community of Herrnhut: he reckons that by doing so, he is advancing the
salvation of his soul. Had he sacrificed a small portion of his revenue, he might have rendered many people
Chapter III

208

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
happy, might have made for them and for himself a heaven upon earth. Our sacrifices are rarely of an active kind;
we, as it were, abandon what we give away. It is not from resolution but despair, that we renounce our property.
In these days, I confess it, the image of the Count is hovering constantly before me; I have firmly resolved on
doing from conviction, what a crazy fear is forcing upon him. I will not wait for being cured. Here are the papers:
they require only to be properly drawn out. Take the lawyer with you; our guest will help: what I want, you know
as well as I; recovering or dying I will stand by it, and say: Here or nowhere is Herrnhut!"
When he mentioned dying, Lydia sank before his bed; she hung upon his arm, and wept bitterly. The surgeon
entered; Jarno gave our friend the papers, and made Lydia leave the room.
"For Heaven's sake! what is this about the Count?" cried Wilhelm, when they reached the hall and were alone:
"What Count is it that means to join the Herrnhuters?"
"One whom you know very well," said Jarno. "You yourself are the ghost who have frightened the unhappy
wiseacre into piety; you are the villain who have brought his pretty wife to such a state, that she inclines
accompanying him."
"And she is Lothario's sister?" cried our friend.
"No other!"−"and Lothario knows−?"
"The whole."
"O let me fly!" cried Wilhelm: "How shall I appear before him? What can he say to me?"
"That no man should cast a stone at his brother; that when one composes long speeches, with a view to shame his
neighbours, he should speak them to a looking−glass."
"Do you know that too?"
"And many things beside," said Jarno with a smile. "But in the present case," continued he, "you shall not get
away from me so easily as you did last time. You need not now be apprehensive of my bounty−money; I have
ceased to be a soldier; when I was one, you might have thought more charitably of me. Since you saw me, many
things have altered. My Prince, my only friend and benefactor, being dead, I have now withdrawn from busy life
and its concerns. I used to have a pleasure in advancing what was reasonable; when I met with any despicable
thing, I hesitated not to call it so: and men had never done with talking of my restless head and wicked tongue.
The herd of people dread sound understanding more than anything; they ought to dread stupidity, if they had any
notion what was really dreadful. Understanding is unpleasant, they must have it pushed aside; stupidity is but
pernicious, they can let it stay. Well, be it so! I need to live; I will by and by communicate my plans to you; if you
incline, you shall partake in them. But tell me first how things have gone with you. I see, I feel that you are
changed. How is it with your ancient maggot of producing something beautiful and good in the society of
gypsies?"
"Do not speak of it!" cried Wilhelm: "I have been already punished for it. People talk about the stage; but none,
that has not been upon it personally, can form the smallest notion of it. How utterly these men are unacquainted
with themselves, how thoughtlessly they carry on their trade, how boundless their pretensions are, no mortal can
conceive. Each not only would be first, but sole; each wishes to exclude the rest, and does not see that even with
them, he can scarcely accomplish anything. Each thinks himself a man of marvellous originality; yet with a
ravening appetite for novelty, he cannot walk a footstep from the beaten track. How vehemently they counterwork
each other! It is only the pitifulest self−love, the narrowest views of interest, that unite them. Of reciprocal
accommodation they have no idea; back−biting and hidden spitefulness maintain a constant jealousy among them.
Chapter III

209

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
In their lives they are either rakes or simpletons. Each claims the loftiest respect, each writhes under the slightest
blame. "All this he knew already,' he will tell you! Why then did he not do it? Ever needy, ever unconfiding, they
seem as if their greatest fear were reason and good taste, their highest care were to secure the majesty of their
self−will."
Wilhelm drew breath, intending to proceed with his eulogium, when an immoderate laugh from Jarno interrupted
him. "Poor actors!" cried he; threw himself into a chair, and laughed away: "Poor dear actors! Do you know, my
friend," continued he, recovering from his fit, "that you have been describing not the playhouse, but the world;
that out of all ranks I could find you characters and doings in abundance, to suit your cruel pencil? Pardon me, it
makes me laugh again, that you should think these amiable qualities existed on the boards alone."
Wilhelm checked his feelings: Jarno's extravagant, untimely laughter had in truth offended him. "It is scarcely
hiding your misanthropy," said he, "when you maintain that faults like these are universal."
"And it shows your unacquaintance with the world, when you impute them to the theatre in such a heinous light. I
pardon in the player every fault that springs from self−deception and the desire to please. If he seem not
something to himself and others, he is nothing. To seem is his vocation; he must prize his moment of applause, for
he gets no other recompense; he must try to glitter, he is there to do so."
"You will give me leave at least to smile, in my turn," answered Wilhelm. "I should never have believed that you
could be so merciful, so tolerant."
"I swear to you I am serious, fully and deliberately serious. All faults of the man I can pardon in the player; no
fault of the player can I pardon in the man. Do not set me upon chanting my lament about the latter: it might have
a sharper sound than yours."
The Surgeon entered from the cabinet; and to the question how his patient was, he answered with a lively air of
complaisance: "Extremely well indeed; I hope soon to see him quite recovered." He hastened through the hall, not
waiting Wilhelm's speech, who was preparing to inquire again with greater importunity about the leathern case.
His anxiety to gain some tiding of his Amazon inspired him with confidence in Jarno: he disclosed his case to
him, and begged his help. "You that know so many things," said he, "can you not discover this?"
Jarno reflected for a moment, then turning to his friend: "Be calm," said he, "give no one any hint of it: we shall
come upon the fair one's footsteps, never fear. At present, I am anxious only for Lothario: the case is dangerous;
the kindliness and comfortable talking of the Doctor tells me so. We should be quit of Lydia; for here she does no
good; but how to set about the task, I know not. Tonight I am looking for our old Physician; we shall then take
farther counsel."

Chapter IV
THE PHYSICIAN came: it was the good, old, little Doctor whom we know already, and to whom we were
obliged for the communication of the pious Manuscript. First of all, he visited the wounded man; with whose
condition he appeared to be by no means satisfied. He had next a long interview with Jarno: but they made no
allusion to the subject of it when they came to supper.
Wilhelm saluted him in the kindest manner, and inquired about the Harper. "We have still hopes of bringing
round the hapless creature," answered the Physician. "He formed a dreary item in your limited and singular way
of life," said Jarno. "How has it fared with him? Tell me."
Having satisfied Jarno's curiosity, the Physician thus proceeded: "I have never seen another man so strangely
Chapter IV

210

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
circumstanced. For many years, he has not felt the smallest interest in anything without him, scarcely paid the
smallest notice to it: wrapped up in himself, he has looked at nothing but his own hollow empty Me, which
seemed to him like an immeasurable abyss. It was really touching, when he spoke to us of this mournful state.
'Before me,' cried he, 'I see nothing; behind me nothing but an endless night, in which I live in the most horrid
solitude. There is no feeling in me, but the feeling of my guilt: and this appears but like a dim formless spirit, far
before me. Yet here there is no height, no depth, no forwards, no backwards; no words can express this
never−changing state. Often in the agony of this sameness, I exclaim with violence: Forever! forever: and this
dark incomprehensible word is clear and plain to the gloom of my condition. No ray of a Divinity illuminates this
night, I shed all my tears by myself and for myself. Nothing is more horrible to me than friendship and love; for
they alone excite in me the wish that the Apparitions which surround me might be real. But these two Spectres
also have arisen from the abyss to plague me, and at length to tear from me the precious consciousness of my
existence, unearthly though it be.'
"You should hear him speak," continued the Physician, "when in hours of confidence he thus alleviates his heart. I
have listened to him often with the deepest feelings. When pressed by anything, and as it were compelled for an
instant to confess that a space of time has passed, he looks astounded, then again refers the alteration to the things
about him, considering it as an appearance of appearances, and so rejecting the idea of progress in duration. One
night he sung a song about his gray hairs; we all sat round him weeping."
"O get it for me!" cried Wilhelm.
"But have you not discovered any trace of what he calls his crime?" inquired Jarno: "nor found out the reason of
his wearing such a singular garb; of his conduct at the burning of the house; of his rage against the child?"
"It is only by conjectures that we can approximate to any knowledge of his fate: to question him directly,
contradicts our principle. Observing easily that he was of the Catholic religion, we thought perhaps confession
might afford him some assuagement; but he shrinks away, with the strangest gestures, every time we try to
introduce the priest to him. However, not to leave your curiosity respecting him entirely unsatisfied, I may
communicate our suppositions on the subject. In his youth, we think, he must have been a clergyman: hence
probably his wish to keep his beard and long cloak. The joys of love appear to have remained for many years
unknown to him. Late in life, as we conceive, some aberration with a lady very nearly related to him; then her
death, the consequence of an unlucky creature's birth, have altogether crazed his brain.
"His chief delusion is a fancy that he brings misfortune everywhere along with him; and that death, to be
unwittingly occasioned by a boy, is constantly impending over him. At first he was afraid of Mignon, not
knowing that she was a girl; then Felix frightened him; and as, with all his misery, he has a boundless love of life,
this may perhaps have been the origin of his aversion to the child."
"What hopes have you of his recovery?" inquired our friend.
"It advances slowly," answered the Physician; "yet it does advance. He continues his appointed occupations: we
have now accustomed him to read the newspapers; he always looks for them with eagerness."
"I am curious about his songs," said Jarno.
"Of these I can engage to get you several," replied the Doctor. "Our parson's eldest son, who frequently writes
down his father's sermons, has, unnoticed by the Harper, marked on paper many stanzas of his singing; out of
which some songs have gradually been pieced together."
Next morning Jarno met our friend, and said to him: "We have to ask a kindness of you. Lydia must, for some
time, be removed: her violent unreasonable love and passionateness hinders the Baron's recovery. His wound

requires rest and calmness, though with his healthy temperament it is not dangerous. You see how Lydia tortures
him with her tempestuous anxieties, her ungovernable terrors, her never−drying tears; and−Enough!" he added
with a smile, after pausing for a moment, "our Doctor expressly requires that she must quit us for a while. We
have got her to believe that a lady, one of her most intimate friends, is at present in the neighbourhood, wishing
and expecting instantly to see her. She has been prevailed upon to undertake a journey to our lawyer's, which is
but two leagues off. This man is in the secret; he will wofully lament that Fräulein Theresa should just have left
him again; he will seem to think she may still be overtaken. Lydia will hasten after her; and if you prosper, will be
led from place to place. At last, if she insist on turning back, you must not contradict her; but the night will help
you; the coachman is a cunning knave, and we shall speak with him before he goes. You are to travel with her in
the coach, to talk to her, and manage the adventure."
"It is a strange and dubious commission that you give me," answered Wilhelm: "How painful is the sight of true
love injured! And am I to be the instrument of injuring it? I have never cheated any person so; for it has always
seemed to me that if we once begin deceiving with a view to good and useful purposes, we run the risk of carrying
it to excess."
"Yet you cannot manage children otherwise," said Jarno.
"With children it may do," said Wilhelm; "for we love them tenderly, and take an open charge of them. But with
our equals, in behalf of whom our heart is not so sure to call upon us for forbearance, it might frequently be
dangerous. Yet do not think," he added, after pausing for a moment, "that I intend to decline the task on this
account. Honouring your judgment, as I do, feeling such attachment to your noble friend, such eagerness to
forward his recovery by whatever means, I willingly forget myself and my opinions. It is not enough that we can
risk our life to serve a friend; in the hour of need we should also yield him our convictions. Our dearest passions,
our best wishes we are bound to sacrifice in helping him. I undertake the charge; though it is easy to foresee the
pain I shall have to suffer from the tears, from the despair of Lydia."
"And for this, no small reward awaits you," answered Jarno: "Fräulein Theresa, whom you get acquainted with, is
a lady such as you will rarely see. She puts many a man to shame: I may say, she is a genuine Amazon; while
others are but pretty counterfeits, that wander up and down the world in that ambiguous dress."
Wilhelm was struck: he almost fancied that in Theresa he would find his Amazon again; especially as Jarno,
whom he importuned to tell him more, broke off abruptly, and went away.
The new, near hope of once more seeing that beloved and honoured being, awoke a thousand feelings in his heart.
He now looked upon the task, which had been given him, as the intervention of a special Providence; the thought
that he was minded treacherously to carry off a helpless girl from the object of her sincerest warmest love, dwelt
but a moment in his mind, as the shadow of a bird flits over the sunshiny earth.
The coach was at the door; Lydia lingered for a moment, as she was about to mount. "Salute your lord again for
me," said she to the old servant; "tell him that I shall be home before night." Tears were standing in her eyes, as
she again looked back when the carriage started. She then turned round to Wilhelm; made an effort to compose
herself, and said: "In Fräulein Theresa you will find a very interesting person. I wonder what it is that brings her
hither: for, you must know, Lothario and she once passionately loved each other. In spite of the distance, he often
used to visit her: I was staying with her then; I thought they would have lived and died for one another. But all at
once it went to wreck, no creature could discover why. He had seen me, and I must confess that I was envious of
Theresa's fortune; that I scarcely hid my love from him; that when he suddenly appeared to choose me in her
stead, I could not but accept of him. She behaved to me beyond my wishes; though it almost seemed as if I had
robbed her of this precious lover. But ah, how many thousand tears and pains that love of his has cost me! At first
we met only now and then, and by stealth, at some appointed place; but I could not long endure that kind of life;
in his presence only was I happy, wholly happy! Far from him, my eyes were never dry, my pulse was never

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
calm. Once he stayed away for several days: I was altogether in despair; I ordered out my carriage, and surprised
him here. He received me tenderly; and had not this unlucky quarrel happened, I should have led a heavenly life
with him. But since the time when he began to be in danger and in pain, I shall not say what I have suffered: at
this moment I am bitterly reproaching myself, that I could leave him for a single day."
Wilhelm was proceeding to inquire about Theresa, when they reached the lawyer's house. This gentleman came
forward to the coach, lamenting wofully that Fräulein Theresa was already gone. He invited them to breakfast;
signifying, however, that the lady might be overtaken in the nearest village. They determined upon following her:
the coachman did not loiter; they had soon passed several villages, and yet come up with nobody. Lydia now gave
orders for returning; the coachman drove along, as if he did not understand her. As she insisted with redoubled
vehemence, Wilhelm called to him, and gave the promised token. The coachman answered, that it was not
necessary to go back by the same road; he knew a shorter, and at the same time greatly easier one. He now turned
aside across a wood, and over large commons. At last, no object they could recognise appearing, he confessed that
unfortunately he had lost his way; declaring at the same time that he would soon get right again, as he saw a little
town before him. Night came on; the coachman managed so discreetly that he asked everywhere, and nowhere
waited for an answer. He drove along all night: Lydia never closed an eye; in the moonshine she was constantly
detecting similarities, which as constantly turned out to be dissimilar. In the morning, things around seemed
known to her, and but more strange on that account. The coach drew up before a neat little country−house; a
young lady stepped out, and opened the carriage−door. Lydia looked at her with a stare of wonder; looked round;
looked at her again; and fainted in the arms of Wilhelm.

Chapter V
WILHELM was conducted to a little upper room: the house was new, as small nearly as it could be, and
extremely orderly and clean. In Theresa, who had welcomed him and Lydia at the coach, he had not found his
Amazon: she was another and an altogether different woman. Handsome, and but of middle stature, she moved
about with great alertness; and it seemed as if her clear blue open eyes let nothing that occurred escape them.
She entered Wilhelm's room, inquiring if he wanted anything. "Pardon me," said she, "for having lodged you in a
chamber which the smell of paint still renders disagreeable: my little dwelling is but just made ready; you are
hand−selling this room, which is appointed for my guests. Would that you had come on some more pleasant
errand! Poor Lydia is like to be a dull companion; in other points also, you will have much to pardon. My cook
has run away from me, at this unseasonable time; and a serving man has bruised his hand. The case might happen
I had to manage everything myself; and if it were so, why then we should just put up with it. One is plagued so
with nobody as with one's servants; none of them will serve you, scarcely even serve himself."
She said a good deal more on different matters; in general she seemed to like speaking. Wilhelm inquired for
Lydia; if he might not see her, and endeavour to excuse himself.
"It will have no effect at present," said Theresa; "time excuses, as it comforts. Words, in both cases, are of little
effect. Lydia will not see you. 'Keep him from my sight,' she cried, when I was leaving her; 'I could almost
despair of human nature. Such an honourable countenance, so frank a manner, and this secret guile!' Lothario she
has quite forgiven: in a letter to the poor girl he declares: 'My friends persuaded me, my friends compelled me!'
Among these she reckons you, and she condemns you with the rest."
"She does me too much honour in so blaming me," said Wilhelm: "I have no pretension to the friendship of that
noble gentleman; on this occasion, I am but a guiltless instrument. I will not praise what I have done; it is enough
that I could do it. It concerned the health, it concerned the life of a man, whom I value more than any one I ever
knew before. O what a man is he, Fräulein; and what men are they that live about him! In their society I for the
first time, I may well say, carried on a conversation; for the first time, was the inmost sense of my words returned
Chapter V

213

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
to me, more rich, more full, more comprehensive, from another's mouth; what I had been groping for, was
rendered clear to me; what I had been thinking, I was taught to see. Unfortunately this enjoyment was disturbed,
at first by numerous anxieties and whims, and then by this unpleasant task. I undertook it with submission; for I
reckoned it my duty, even though I sacrificed my feelings, to comply with the request of this gifted company of
men."
While he spoke, Theresa had been looking at him with a very friendly air. "O how sweet is it, to hear one's own
opinion uttered by a stranger tongue! We are never properly ourselves until another thinks entirely as we do. My
own opinion of Lothario is perfectly the same as yours: it is not every one that does him justice; and therefore all
that know him better are enthusiastic in esteem of him. The painful sentiment that mingles with the memory of
him in my heart, cannot hinder me from thinking of him daily." A sigh heaved her bosom as she spoke thus; and a
lovely tear glittered in her right eye. "Think not," continued she, "that I am so weak, so easy to be moved. It is but
the eye that weeps. There was a little wart upon the under eyelid; they have happily removed it; but the eye has
been weak ever since; the smallest cause brings a tear into it. Here sat the little wart: you cannot see a vestige of it
now."
He saw no vestige; but he saw into her eye; it was clear as crystal; he almost imagined he could see to the very
bottom of her soul.
"We have now," said she, "pronounced the watchword of our friendship: let us get entirely acquainted as fast as
possible. The history of every person paints his character. I will tell you what my life has been: do you too place a
little trust in me; and let us be united even when distance parts us. The world is so waste and empty, when we
figure only towns and hills and rivers in it; but to know of some one here and there whom we accord with, who is
living on with us even in silence, this makes our earthly ball a peopled garden."
She hastened off; engaging soon to take him out to walk. Her presence had affected him agreeably: he wished to
be informed of her relation to Lothario. He was called; she came to meet him from her room. While they
descended, necessarily one by one, the strait and even steepish stairs, she said. "All this might have been larger
and grander, had I chosen to accept the offers of your generous friend: but to continue worthy of him, I must study
to retain the qualities which gave me merit in his eyes.−Where is the steward?" asked she, stepping from the
bottom of the stairs. "You must not think," continued she, "that I am rich enough to need a steward; the few acres
of my own little property I myself can manage well enough. The steward is my new neighbour's, who has bought
a fine estate beside us, every point of which I am acquainted with. The good old gentleman is lying ill of gout; his
men are strangers here; I willingly assist in settling them."
They took a walk through fields, meadows and some orchards. Everywhere Theresa kept instructing the steward;
nothing so minute but she could give account of it; and Wilhelm had reason to wonder at her knowledge, her
precision, the prompt dexterity with which she suggested means for ends. She loitered nowhere; always hastened
to the leading points; and thus her task was quickly over. "Salute your master," said she, as she sent away the
man; "I mean to visit him as soon as possible, and wish him a complete recovery.−There now," she added with a
smile, as soon as he was gone, "I might soon be rich: my good neighbour, I believe, would not be disinclined to
offer me his hand."
"The old man with the gout?" cried Wilhelm: "I know not how, at your years, you could bring yourself to make so
desperate a determination." "Nor am I tempted to it!" said Theresa: "Whoever can administer what he possesses
has enough, and to be wealthy is a burdensome affair, unless you understand it."
Wilhelm testified his admiration at her skill in husbandry concerns. "Decided inclination, early opportunity,
external impulse, and continued occupation in a useful business," said she, "make many things, which were at first
far harder, possible in life. When you have learned what causes stimulated me in this pursuit, you will cease to
wonder at the talent you now think strange."
Chapter V

214

On returning home, she sent him to her little garden. Here he could scarcely turn himself, so narrow were the
walks, so thickly was it sown and planted. On looking over to the court, he could not help smiling: the firewood
was lying there, as accurately sawed, split and piled, as if it had been part of the building, and had been intended
to continue permanently there. The tubs and implements, all clean, were standing in their places: the house was
painted white and red; it was really pleasant to behold. Whatever can be done by handicraft, which knows not
beautiful proportions, but labours for convenience, cheerfulness and durability, appeared united in this spot. They
served him up dinner in his own room; he had time enough for meditating. Especially it struck him, that he should
have got acquainted with another person of so interesting a character, who had been so closely related to Lothario.
"It is just," said he to himself, "that a man so gifted should attract round him gifted women. How far the influence
of manliness and dignity extends! Would that others did not come so wofully short, compared with him! Yes,
confess thy fear. When thou meetest with thy Amazon, this woman of women, in spite of all thy hopes and
dreaming, thou wilt find her, in the end, to thy humiliation and thy shame,−his bride."

Chapter VI
WILHELM had passed a restless afternoon, not altogether without tedium; when towards evening his door
opened, and a handsome hunter−boy stept forward with a bow. "Shall we have a walk?" said the youth; and in the
instant Wilhelm recognised Theresa by her lovely eyes.
"Pardon me this masquerade," said she; "for now, alas, it is nothing more. But as I am going to tell you of the time
when I so enjoyed the world, I will recall those days, by every method, to my fancy. Come along! Even the place,
where we have rested so often from our hunts and promenades, shall help me."
They went accordingly. On the way, Theresa said to her attendant: "It is not fair that I alone should speak: you
already know enough of me, I nothing about you. Tell me in the mean while something of yourself, that I may
gather courage to submit to you my history and situation." "Alas!" said Wilhelm, "I have nothing to relate but
error on the back of error, deviation following deviation: and I know none from whom I would more gladly hide
my present and my past embarrassments than from yourself. Your look, the scene you move in, your whole
temperament and manner, prove to me that you have reason to rejoice in your bygone life; that you have travelled
by a fair, clear path, in constant progress; that you have lost no time, that you have nothing to reproach yourself
withal."
Theresa answered with a smile: "Let us see if you will think so, after you have heard my history." They walked
along: among some general remarks, Theresa asked him: "Are you free?" "I think I am," said he; "and yet I do not
wish it." "Good!" said she: "that indicates a complicated story; you also will have something to relate."
Conversing thus, they ascended the hill, and placed themselves beside a lofty oak, which spread its shade far out
on every side. "Here," said she, "beneath this German tree, will I disclose to you the history of a German maiden:
listen to me patiently.
"My father was a wealthy nobleman of this province, a cheerful, clear−sighted, active, able man; a tender father,
an upright friend, an excellent economist. I knew but one fault in him; he was too compliant to a wife who did not
know his worth. Alas, that I should have to say so of my mother! Her nature was the opposite of his. She was
quick and changeful; without affection either for her home, or for me her only child; extravagant, but beautiful,
sprightly, full of talent, the delight of a circle she had gathered round her. Her society in truth was never large; nor
did it long continue the same. It consisted principally of men; for no woman could like to be near her, still less
could she endure the merit or the praise of any woman. I resembled my father, both in form and dispositions. As
the duckling, with its first footsteps, seeks the water; so, from my earliest youth, the kitchen, the store−room, the
granaries, the fields, were my selected element. Cleanliness and order in the house, seemed, even while I was
playing in it, to be my peculiar instinct, my peculiar object. This tendency gave my father pleasure; and he
Chapter VI

215

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
directed, step by step, my childish endeavour into the suitablest employments. On the contrary, my mother did not
like me, and she never for a moment hid it.
"I waxed in stature: with my years, increased my turn for occupation and my father's love to me. When we were
by ourselves, when walking through the fields, when I was helping to examine his accounts, it was then I could
see how glad he was. While gazing on his eyes, I felt as if I had been looking in upon myself; for it was in the
eyes that I completely resembled him. But in the presence of my mother, he lost this energy, this aspect: he
excused me mildly, when she blamed me unjustly and violently; he took my part, not as if he would protect me,
but as if he would extenuate the demerit of my good qualities. To none of her caprices did he set himself in
opposition. She began to be immensely taken with a passion for the stage; a theatre was soon got up; of men of all
shapes and ages, crowding to display themselves along with her upon her boards, she had abundance; of women,
on the other hand, there was often a scarcity. Lydia, a pretty girl, who had been brought up with me, and who
promised from the first to be extremely beautiful, had to undertake the secondary parts; the mothers and the aunts
were represented by an ancient chambermaid; while the leading heroines, lovers, and shepherdesses of every kind,
were seized on by my mother. I cannot tell you how ridiculous it seemed to me, to see the people, every one of
whom I knew full well, standing on their scaffold, and pretending, after they had dressed themselves in other
clothes, to pass for something else than what they were. In my eyes they were never anything but Lydia and my
mother, this baron and that secretary, whether they appeared as counts and princes or as peasants: and I could not
understand how they meant to make me think that they were sad or happy, that they were indifferent or in love,
liberal or avaricious, when I well knew the contrary to be the case. Accordingly, I very seldom stayed among the
audience: I always snuffed their candles, that I might not be entirely without employment; I prepared the supper,
and next morning before they rose I used to have their wardrobe all sorted, which commonly, the night before,
they had left in a chaotic state.
"To my mother this activity appeared quite proper; but her love I could not gain. She despised me; and I know for
certain that she more than once exclaimed with bitterness: 'If the mother could be as uncertain as the father, you
would scarcely take this housemaid for my daughter!' Such treatment, I confess, at length entirely estranged me
from her: I viewed her conduct as the conduct of a person unconnected with me; and being used to watch our
servants like a falcon (for this, be it said in passing, is the ground of all true housekeeping), the proceedings of my
mother and her friends, at the same time, naturally forced themselves upon my observation. It was easy to
perceive that she did not look on all the men alike: I gave sharper heed; and soon found out that Lydia was her
confidant, and had herself, by this opportunity, become acquainted with a passion, which from her earliest youth
she had so often represented. I was aware of all their meetings: but I held my tongue: hinting nothing to my father,
whom I was afraid of troubling. At last, however, I was obliged to speak. Many of their enterprises could not be
accomplished without corrupting the servants. These now began to grow refractory; they despised my father's
regulations, disregarded my commands. The disorders which arose from this I could not tolerate; I discovered all,
complained of all to my father.
"He listened to me calmly. 'Good girl!' replied he with a smile; 'I know it all: be quiet, bear it patiently; for it is on
thy account alone that I endure it.'
"I was not quiet, I had not patience. I in secret blamed my father; for I did not think that any reason should induce
him to endure such things. I called for regularity from all the servants; I was bent on driving matters to extremity.
"My mother had been rich before her marriage; yet she squandered more than she had a right to; and this, as I
observed, occasioned many conferences between my parents. For a long time, the evil was not helped; till at last
the passions of my mother brought it to a head.
"Her first gallant became unfaithful in a glaring manner: the house, the neighbourhood, her whole condition grew
offensive to her. She insisted on removing to a different estate; there she was too solitary: she insisted on
removing to the town; there she felt herself eclipsed among the crowd. Of much that passed between my father
Chapter VI

216

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
and her I know nothing: however, he at last determined, under stipulations which I did not learn, to consent that
she should take a journey, which she had been meditating, to the South of France.
"We were now free; we lived as if in heaven: I do believe, my father could not be a loser, had he purchased her
absence by a considerable sum. All our useless domestics were dismissed; and fortune seemed to smile on our
undertakings: we had some extremely prosperous years; all things succeeded to our wish. But, alas, this pleasing
state was not of long continuance; altogether unexpectedly my father had a shock of palsy; it lamed his right side,
and deprived him of the proper use of speech. We had to guess at everything that he required; for he never could
pronounce the word that he intended. There were times when this was dreadfully afflicting to us: he would require
expressly to be left alone with me; with earnest gestures he would signify that every one should go away; and
when we saw ourselves alone, he could not speak the word he meant. His impatience mounted to the highest
pitch: his situation touched me to the inmost heart. Thus much seemed certain: he had something which he wished
to tell me, which especially concerned my interest. What longing did I feel to know it! At other times, I could
discover all things in his eyes: but now it was in vain. Even his eyes no longer spoke. Only this was clear: he
wanted nothing, he desired nothing; he was striving to discover something to me; which unhappily I did not learn.
His malady revisited him: he grew entirely inactive, incapable of motion, and a short time afterwards he died.
"I know not how it had got rooted in my thoughts that somewhere he had hid a treasure, which he wished at death
to leave me rather than my mother: I searched about for traces of it while he lived, but I could meet with none; at
his death a seal was put on everything. I wrote to my mother, offering to continue in the house, and manage for
her: she refused, and I was obliged to leave the place. A mutual testament was now produced; it gave my mother
the possession and the use of all; and I was left, at least throughout her life, dependent on her. It was now that I
conceived I rightly understood my father's beckoning: I pitied him for having been so weak; he had let himself be
forced to do unjustly to me even after he was dead. Certain of my friends maintained, that it was little better than
if he had disinherited me: they called upon me to attack the will by law; but this I never could resolve on doing. I
reverenced my father's memory too much; I trusted in destiny; I trusted in myself.
"There was a lady in the neighbourhood possessed of large property, with whom I had always been on good
terms: she gladly received me; I engaged to superintend her household, and ere long the task grew very easy to
me. She lived regularly, she loved order in everything: and I faithfully assisted her in struggling with her steward
and domestics. I am neither of a niggardly nor grudging temper; but we women are disposed to insist, more
earnestly than men, that nothing shall be wasted. Embezzlement of all sorts is intolerable to us: we require that
each enjoy exactly in so far as right entitles him.
"Here I was in my element once more; I mourned my father's death in silence. My protectress was content with
me: one small circumstance alone disturbed my peace. Lydia returned: my mother had been harsh enough to cast
the poor girl off, after having altogether spoiled her. Lydia had learned with her mistress to consider passions as
her occupation; she was wont to curb herself in nothing. On her unexpected reappearance, the lady whom I lived
with took her in; she wished to help me, but could train herself to nothing.
"About this time, the relatives and future heirs of my protectress often visited the house, to recreate themselves
with hunting. Lothario was frequently among them: it was not long till I had noticed, though without the smallest
reference to myself, how far he was superior to the rest. He was courteous towards all; and Lydia seemed ere long
to have attracted his attention to her. Constantly engaged in something, I was seldom with the company: while he
was there I did not talk so much as usual; for I will confess it, lively conversation, from of old, had been to me the
finest seasoning of existence. With my father I was wont to talk of everything that happened. What you do not
speak of, you will seldom accurately think of. No man had I ever heard with greater pleasure than I did Lothario,
when he told us of his travels and campaigns. The world appeared to lie before him clear and open, as to me the
district was in which I lived and managed. We were not entertained with marvellous personal adventures, the
extravagant half−truths of a shallow traveller, who is always painting out himself, and not the country he has
undertaken to describe. Lothario did not tell us his adventures; he led us to the place itself. I have seldom felt so
Chapter VI

217

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
pure a satisfaction.
"But still higher was my pleasure, when I heard him talk, one evening, about women. The subject happened to be
introduced; some ladies of the neighbourhood had come to see us; and were speaking, in the common style, about
the cultivation of the female mind. Our sex, they said, was treated unjustly; every sort of higher education men
insisted on retaining for themselves: they admitted us to no science, they required us either to be dolls or family
drudges. To all this Lothario said not much: but when the party was a little thinned, he gave us his opinion more
explicitly. 'It is very strange,' cried he, 'that men are blamed for their proceeding here: they have placed woman on
the highest station she is capable of occupying. And where is there any station higher than the ordering of the
house? While the husband has to vex himself with outward matters, while he has wealth to gather and secure,
while perhaps he takes part in the administration of the state, and everywhere depends on circumstances; ruling
nothing, I may say, while he conceives that he is ruling much; compelled to be but politic where he would
willingly be reasonable, to dissemble where he would be open, to be false where he would be upright; while thus,
for the sake of an object which he never reaches, he must every moment sacrifice the first of objects, harmony
with himself,−a reasonable housewife is actually governing in the interior of her family; has the comfort and
activity of every person in it to provide for, and make possible. What is the highest happiness of mortals, if not to
execute what we consider right and good; to be really masters of the means conducive to our aims? And where
should or can our nearest aims be, but in the interior of our home? All those indispensable, and still to be renewed
supplies, where do we expect, do we require to find them, if not in the place where we rise and where we go to
sleep, where kitchen and cellar, and every species of accommodation for ourselves and ours is to be always
ready? What unvarying activity is needed to conduct this constantly recurring series in unbroken living order!
How few are the men, to whom it is given to return regularly like a star, to command their day as they command
their night; to form for themselves their household instruments, to sow and to reap, to gain and to expend, and to
travel round their circle with perpetual success and peace and love! It is when a woman has attained this inward
mastery, that she truly makes the husband whom she loves a master: her attention will acquire all sorts of
knowledge; her activity will turn them all to profit. Thus is she dependent upon no one; and she procures her
husband genuine independence, that which is interior and domestic: whatever he possesses, he beholds secured;
what he earns, well employed; and thus he can direct his mind to lofty objects, and if fortune favours, he may act
in the state the same character which so well becomes his wife at home.'
"He then described to us the kind of wife he wished. I reddened; for he was describing me as I looked and lived. I
silently enjoyed my triumph; and the more, as I perceived, from all the circumstances, that he had not meant me
individually, that indeed he did not know me. I cannot recollect a more delightful feeling in my life than this,
when a man whom I so highly valued gave the preference, not to my person, but to my inmost nature. What a
recompense did I consider it! What encouragement did it afford me!
"So soon as they were gone, my worthy benefactress, with a smile, observed to me: 'Pity that men often think and
speak of what they will never execute, else here were a special match, the exact thing for my dear Theresa!' I
made sport of her remark; and added, that indeed men's understanding gave its vote for household wives; but that
their heart and imagination longed for other qualities; and that we household people could not stand a rivalry with
beautiful and lovely women. This was spoken for the ear of Lydia; she did not hide from us that Lothario had
made a deep impression on her heart; and in reality, he seemed at each new visit to grow more and more attentive
to her. She was poor and not of rank; she could not think of marriage; but she was unable to resist the dear delight
of charming and of being charmed. I had never loved, nor did I love at present: but though it was unspeakably
agreeable to see in what light my turn of mind was viewed, how high it was ranked by such a man, I will confess I
still was not altogether satisfied. I now wished that he should be acquainted with me, and should take a personal
interest in me. This wish arose, without the smallest settled thought of anything that could result from it.
"The greatest service I did my benefactress, was in bringing into order the extensive forests which belonged to
her. In this precious property, whose value time and circumstances were continually increasing, matters still went
on according to the old routine; without regularity, without plan: no end to theft and fraud. Many hills were

standing bare; an equal growth was nowhere to be found but in the oldest cuttings. I personally visited the whole
of them, with an experienced forester. I got the woods correctly measured; I set men to hew, to sow, to plant; in a
short time, all things were in progress. That I might mount more readily on horseback, and also walk on foot with
less obstruction, I had a suit of men's clothes made for me; I was present in many places, I was feared in all.
"Hearing that our young friends with Lothario were purposing to have another hunt, it came into my head, for the
first time in my life, to make a figure; or that I may not do myself injustice, to pass in the eyes of this noble
gentleman for what I was. I put on my men's−clothes, took my gun upon my shoulder, and went forward with our
hunters, to await the party on our marches. They came; Lothario did not know me: a nephew of the lady's
introduced me to him as a clever forester; joked about my youth, and carried on his jesting in my praise, till at last
Lothario recognised me. The nephew seconded my project, as if we had concocted it together. He circumstantially
and gratefuly described what I had done for the estates of his aunt, and consequently for himself.
"Lothario listened with attention; he talked with me; inquired concerning all particulars of the estates and district.
I of course was glad to have such an opportunity of showing him my knowledge: I stood my ordeal very well; I
submitted certain projects of improvement to him; which he sanctioned, telling me of similar examples, and
strengthening my arguments by the connexion which he gave them. My satisfaction grew more perfect every
moment. Happily, however, I merely wished that he should be acquainted with me, not that he should love me.
We came home: and I observed more clearly than before, that the attention he showed to Lydia seemed expressive
of a secret inclination. I had reached my object; yet I was not at rest: from that day, he showed a true respect for
me, a fine trust in me; in company he usually spoke to me, asked my opinion, and appeared to be persuaded that,
in household matters, nothing was unknown to me. His sympathy excited me extremely: even when the
conversation was of general finance and political economy, he used to lead me to take part in it; and in his
absence, I endeavoured to acquire more knowledge of our province, nay of all the empire. The task was easy for
me: it was but repeating on the great scale what I knew so accurately on the small.
"From this period he visited our house oftener. We talked, I may say, of everything: yet in some degree our
conversation always in the end grew economical, if even but in a secondary sense. What immense effects a man,
by the continuous application of his powers, his time, his money, even by means which seem but small, may bring
about, was frequently and largely spoken of.
"I did not withstand the tendency which drew me towards him: and, alas, I felt too soon how deep, how cordial,
how pure and genuine was my love, as I believed it more and more apparent that Lydia and not myself was the
occasion of these visits. She, at least, was most vividly persuaded so; she made me her confidant; and this, again,
in some degree, consoled me. For in truth, what she explained so much to her advantage, I reckoned nowise of
importance; there was not a trace of any serious lasting union being meditated; but the more distinctly did I see
the wish of the impassioned girl to be his at any price.
"Thus did matters stand, when the lady of the house surprised me with an unexpected message. 'Lothario,' said
she, 'offers you his hand, and desires through life to have you ever at his side.' She enlarged upon my qualities,
and told me, what I liked sufficiently to hear, that in me Lothario was persuaded he had found the person whom
he had so long been seeking for.
"The height of happiness was now attained for me: my hand was asked by a man for whom I had the greatest
value; beside whom and along with whom I might expect a full, expanded, free and profitable employment of my
inborn tendency, of my talent perfected by practice. The sum of my existence seemed to have enlarged itself into
infinitude. I gave my consent; he himself came, and spoke with me in private; he held out his hand to me; he
looked into my eyes, he clasped me in his arms, and pressed a kiss upon my lips. It was the first and the last. He
confided to me all his circumstances; told me how much his American campaign had cost him, what debts he had
accumulated on his property; that, on this score, he had in some measure quarrelled with his granduncle; that the
worthy gentleman intended to relieve him, though truly in his own peculiar way, being minded to provide him
Chapter VI

with a rich wife, whereas a man of sense would choose a household wife at all events; that however, by his sister's
influence, he hoped his noble relative would be persuaded. He set before me the condition of his fortune, his
plans, his prospects, and requested my coöperation. Till his uncle should consent, our promise was to be a secret.
"Scarcely was he gone, when Lydia asked me, whether he had spoken of her. I answered no; and tired her with a
long detail of economical affairs. She was restless, out of humour; and his conduct, when he came again, did not
improve her situation.
"But the sun, I see, is bending to the place of rest. Well for you, my friend! You would otherwise have had to hear
this story, which I often enough go over by myself, in all its most minute particulars. Let me hasten: we are
coming to an epoch, on which it is not good to linger.
"By Lothario I was made acquainted with his noble sister; and she, at a convenient time, contrived to introduce
me to the uncle. I gained the old man; he consented to our wishes; and I returned, with happy tidings, to my
benefactress. The affair was now no secret in the house: Lydia heard of it; she thought the thing impossible. When
she could no longer doubt of it, she vanished all at once: we knew not whither she had gone.
"Our marriage−day was coming near: I had often asked him for his portrait; just as he was going off, I reminded
him that he had promised it. He said: 'You have never given me the case you want to have it fitted into.' This was
true: I had got a present from a female friend, on which I set no ordinary value. Her name, worked from her own
hair, was fastened on the outer glass; within there was a vacant piece of ivory, on which her portrait was to have
been painted, when a sudden death snatched her from me. Lothario's love had cheered me at the time her death lay
heavy on my spirits: and I wished to have the void, which she had left me in her present, filled by the picture of
my friend.
"I ran to my chamber; fetched my jewel−box, and opened it in his presence. Scarcely had he looked into it, when
he noticed a medallion with the portrait of a lady. He took it in his hand, considered it attentively, and asked me
hastily whose face it was. 'My mother's,' answered I. 'I could have sworn,' said he, 'that it was the portrait of a
Madame Saint Alban, whom I met some years ago in Switzerland.' 'It is the same,' replied I, smiling; 'and so you
have unwittingly become acquainted with your stepmother. Saint Alban is the name my mother has assumed for
travelling with: she passes under it in France at present.'
"'I am the miserablest man alive!' exclaimed he, as he threw the portrait back into the box, covered his eyes with
his hand, and hurried from the room. He sprang on horseback; I ran to the balcony, and called out after him: he
turned, waved his hand to me, went speedily away,−and I have never seen him more."
The sun went down: Theresa gazed with unaverted looks upon the splendour; and both her fine eyes filled with
tears.
Theresa spoke not: she laid her hand upon her new friend's hands: he kissed it with emotion; she dried her tears,
and rose. "Let us return, and see that all is right," said she.
The conversation was not lively by the way. They entered the garden−door, and noticed Lydia sitting on a bench:
she rose, withdrew before them, and walked in. She had a paper in her hand; two little girls were by her. "I see,"
observed Theresa, "she is still carrying her only comfort, Lothario's letter, with her. He promises that she shall
live with him again, so soon as he is well: he begs of her till then to stay in peace with me. On these words she
hangs; with these lines she solaces herself: but with his friends she is extremely angry."
Meanwhile the two children had approached. They courtesied to Theresa, and gave her an account of all that had
occurred while she was absent. "You see here another part of my employment," said Theresa. "Lothario's sister
and I have made a league: we educate some little ones in common: such as promise to be lively serviceable
Chapter VI

housewives I take charge of; she of such as show a finer and more quiet talent: it is right to provide for the
happiness of future husbands both in household and in intellectual matters. When you become acquainted with my
noble friend, a new era in your life will open. Her beauty, her goodness, make her worthy of the reverence of the
world." Wilhelm did not venture to confess, that unhappily the lovely Countess was already known to him: that
his transient connexion with her would occasion him perpetual sorrow. He was well pleased that Theresa let the
conversation drop; that some business called for her within. He was now alone: the intelligence which he had just
received, of the young and lovely Countess being driven to replace, by deeds of benevolence, her own lost
comfort, made him very sad; he felt that with her it was but a need of self−oblivion, an attempt to supply, by the
hopes of happiness to others, the want of a cheerful enjoyment of existence in herself. He thought Theresa happy,
since even in that unexpected melancholy alteration which had taken place in her prospects, there was no
alteration needed in herself. "How fortunate beyond all others," cried he, "is the man who, in order to adjust
himself to fate, is not required to cast away his whole preceding life!"
Theresa came into his room, and begged pardon for disturbing him. "My whole library," said she, "is in the
wall−press here; they are rather books which I do not throw aside, than which I have taken up. Lydia wants a
pious book: there are one or two of that sort among them. Persons who throughout the whole twelve months are
worldly, think it necessary to be godly at a time of straits: all moral and religious matters they regard as physic,
which is to be taken, with aversion, when they are unwell: in a clergyman, a moralist, they see nothing but a
doctor, whom they cannot soon enough get rid of. Now, I confess, I look upon religion as a kind of diet, which
can only be so when I make a constant practice of it, when throughout the whole twelve months I never lose it out
of sight."
She searched among the books; she found some edifying works, as they are called. "It was of my mother," said
Theresa, "that poor Lydia learned to have recourse to books like these. While her gallant continued faithful, plays
and novels were her life; his departure brought religious writings once more into credit. I, for my share, cannot
understand," continued she, "how men have made themselves believe that God speaks to us through books and
histories. The man, to whom the universe does not reveal directly what relation it has to him; whose heart does
not tell him what he owes to himself and others,−that man will scarcely learn it out of books; which generally do
little more than give our errors names."
She left our friend alone: he passed his evening in examining the little library; it had, in truth, been gathered quite
at random.
Theresa, for the few days Wilhelm spent with her, continued still the same: she related to him, at different times,
the consequences of that singular incident with great minuteness. Day and hour, place and name, were present to
her memory: we shall here compress into a word or two, so much of it as will be necessary for the information of
our readers.
The reason of Lothario's quick departure was unhappily too easy to explain. He had met Theresa's mother on her
journey: her charms attracted him; she was no niggard of them; and this luckless transitory aberration came at
length to shut him out from being united to a lady, whom nature seemed to have expressly made for him. As for
Theresa, she continued in the pure circle of her duties. They learned that Lydia had been living in the
neighbourhood in secret. She was happy that the marriage, though for unknown causes, had not been completed.
She endeavoured to renew her intimacy with Lothario: and more, as it seemed, out of desperation than affection,
by surprise than with consideration, from tedium than of purpose, he had met her wishes.
Theresa was quiet on the subject; she made no pretensions farther to him; and if he had even been her husband,
she would probably have had sufficient spirit to endure a matter of this kind, if it had not troubled her domestic
order: at least she often used to say, that a wife, who properly conducted her economy, should take no umbrage at
such little fancies of her husband, but be always certain that he would return.

Chapter VI

221

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Ere long, Theresa's mother had deranged her fortune: the losses fell upon the daughter, whose share of the effects,
in consequence, was small. The old lady, who had been Theresa's benefactress, died; leaving her a little property
in land, and a handsome sum by way of legacy. Theresa soon contrived to make herself at home in this new
narrow circle. Lothario offered her a better property, Jarno endeavouring to negotiate the business: but she refused
it. "I will show," said she, "in this little that I deserved to share the great with him: but I keep this before me, that,
should accident embarrass me, on my own account or that of others, I will betake myself without the smallest
hesitation to my generous friend."
There is nothing less liable to be concealed and unemployed than well−directed practical activity. Scarcely had
she settled in her little property, when her acquaintance and advice began to be desired by many of her
neighbours; and the proprietor of the adjacent lands gave her plainly enough to understand, that it depended on
herself alone, whether she would take his hand, and be heiress of the greater part of his estates. She had already
mentioned the matter to our friend: she often jested with him about marriages, suitable and unsuitable.
"Nothing," said she once, "gives a greater loose to people's tongues, than when a marriage happens, which they
can denominate unsuitable: and yet the unsuitable are far more common than the suitable; for, alas, with most
marriages, it is not long till things assume a very piteous look. The confusion of ranks by marriage can be called
unsuitable, only when the one party is unable to participate in the manner of existence which is native, habitual,
and which at length grows absolutely necessary to the other. The different classes have different ways of living,
which they cannot change or communicate to one another; and this is the reason why connexions such as these, in
general, were better not formed. Yet exceptions, and exceptions of the happiest kind, are possible. Thus too, the
marriage of a young woman with a man advanced in life is generally unsuitable: yet I have seen some such turn
out extremely well. For me, I know but of one kind of marriage that would be entirely unsuitable; that in which I
should be called upon to make a show, and manage ceremonies: I had rather give my hand to the son of any
honest farmer in the neighbourhood."
Wilhelm at length made ready for returning. He requested of Theresa to obtain for him a parting word with Lydia.
The impassioned girl at last consented: he said some kindly things to her; to which she answered: "The first burst
of anguish I have conquered. Lothario will be ever dear to me: but for those friends of his, I know them; and it
grieves me that they are about him. The Abbé for a whim's sake, could leave a person in extreme need, or even
plunge one into it; the Doctor would have all things go on like clock−work; Jarno has no heart: and you−at least
no force of character! Just go on; let these three people use you as their tool; they will have many an execution to
commit to you. For a long time, as I know well, my presence has been hateful to them: I had not found out their
secret, but I had observed that they had one. Why these bolted rooms, these strange passages? Why can no one
ever reach the central tower? Why did they banish me, whenever they could, to my own chamber? I will confess,
jealousy at first incited me to these discoveries: I feared some lucky rival might be hid there. I have now laid aside
that suspicion: I am well convinced that Lothario loves me, that he means honourably by me; but I am quite as
well convinced that his false and artful friends betray him. If you would really do him service; if you would ever
be forgiven for the injury which I have suffered from you, free him from the hands of these men. But what am I
expecting! Give this letter to him: repeat what it contains; that I will love him for ever, that I depend upon his
word. Ah!" cried she, rising and throwing herself with tears upon Theresa's neck: "he is surrounded by my foes;
they will endeavour to persuade him that I have sacrificed nothing for his sake: O! Lothario may well believe that
he is worthy of any sacrifice, without needing to be grateful for it."
Wilhelm's parting with Theresa was more cheerful: she wished they might soon meet again. "Me you wholly
know," said she: "I alone have talked while we have been together. It will be your duty, next time, to repay my
candour."
During his return, he kept contemplating this new and bright phenomenon, with the liveliest recollection. What
confidence had she inspired him with! He thought of Mignon and Felix; and how happy they might be if under
her direction; then he thought of himself; and felt what pleasure it would be to live beside a being so entirely
Chapter VI

222

serene and clear. As he approached Lothario's Castle, he observed, with more than usual interest, the central tower
and the many passages and side−buildings: he resolved to question Jarno or the Abbé on the subject, by the
earliest opportunity.

Chapter VII
ON arriving at the Castle, Wilhelm found its noble owner in the way of full recovery: the Doctor and the Abbé
had gone off; Jarno alone was there. It was not long till the patient now and then could ride; sometimes by
himself; sometimes with his friends. His conversation was at once courteous and earnest, instructive and
enlivening: you could often notice in it traces of a tender sensibility, although he strove to hide it, and almost
seemed to blame it, when in spite of him it came to view.
One evening while at table he was silent, though his look was very cheerful.
"Today," said Jarno, "you have met with an adventure; and a pleasing one?"
"I give you credit for your penetration!" said Lothario. "Yes, I have met with a very pleasing adventure. At
another time, perhaps I should not have considered it so charming as to−day, when it came upon me so
attractively. Towards night, I rode out beyond the river, through the hamlets, by a path which I had often visited
in former years. My corporeal sufferings must have reduced me more than I supposed: I felt weak; but as my
strength was reawakening, I was as it were new−born. All objects seemed to wear the hues they had in earlier
times; all looked graceful, lovely, charming, as they have not looked to me for many years. I easily observed that
it was mere debility; yet I continued to enjoy it: I rode softly onwards, and could now conceive how men may
grow to like diseases, which attune us to those sweet emotions. You know, perhaps, what used of old so
frequently to lead me that way?"
"If I mistake not," answered Jarno, "it was a little love concern you were engaged in with a farmer's daughter."
"It might be called a great one," said Lothario: "for we loved each other deeply, seriously and for a long time.
Today, it happened, everything combined to represent before me in its liveliest colour the earliest season of our
love. The boys were again shaking maybugs from the trees; the ashen grove had not grown larger since the day I
saw her first. It was now long since I had met with Margaret. She is married at a distance; and I had heard by
chance, that she was come with her children, some weeks ago, to pay a visit to her father."
"This ride, then, was not altogether accidental?"
"I will not deny," replied Lothario, "that I wished to meet her. On coming near the house, I saw her father sitting
at the door; a child of probably a year old was standing by him. As I approached, a female gave a hasty look from
an upper window; and a minute afterwards, I heard some person tripping down−stairs. I thought surely it was she:
and I will confess, I was flattering myself that she had recognised me, and was hastening to meet me. But what
was my surprise and disappointment, when she bounded from the door, seized the child, to which the horses had
come pretty close, and took it in! It gave me a painful twinge: my vanity, however, was a little solaced, when I
thought I saw a tint of redness on her neck, and on the ear, which was uncovered.
"I drew up, and spoke a little with the father, glancing sideways, in the mean time, over all the windows, to
observe if she would not appears at some of them: but no trace of her was visible. Ask I would not; so I rode
away. My displeasure was a little mollified by wonder: though I had not seen the face, it appeared to me that she
was scarcely changed; and ten years are a pretty space! Nay she looked even younger, quite as slim, as light of
foot; her neck if possible was lovelier than before; her cheeks as quick at blushing; yet she was the mother of six
children, perhaps of more. This apparition suited the enchantment which surrounded me so well, that I rode along
Chapter VII

223

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
with feelings grown still younger: and I did not turn till I was at the forest, when the sun was going down.
Strongly as the falling dew, and the prescription of our Doctor, called upon me to proceed direct homewards, I
could not help again going round by the farmhouse. I observed a woman walking up and down the garden, which
is fenced by a light hedge. I rode along the footpath to it; and found myself at no great distance from the person
whom I wanted.
"Though the evening sun was glancing in my eyes, I saw that she was busy with the hedge, which only slightly
covered her. I thought I recognised my mistress. On coming up, I halted, not without a palpitation at the heart.
Some high twigs of wild roses, which a soft air was blowing to and fro, made her figure indistinct to me. I spoke
to her, asked her how she was. She answered in an undertone, 'Quite well.' In the mean time I perceived a child
behind the hedge, engaged in plucking roses, and I took the opportunity of asking where the other children were.
'It is not my child,' said she: 'that were rather early!' And at this moment, it happened that the twigs were blown
aside, and her face could be distinctly seen. I knew not what to make of the affair. It was my mistress, and it was
not. Almost younger, almost lovelier than she used to be ten years before. 'Are not you the farmer's daughter,
then?' inquired I, half confused. 'No,' said she: 'I am her cousin.'
"'You resemble one another wonderfully,' added I.
"'Yes, so says every one that knew her half−a−score of years ago.'
"I continued putting various questions to her: my mistake was pleasant to me, even after I had found it out. I could
not leave this living image of bygone blessedness, that stood before me. The child meanwhile had gone away; it
had wandered to the pond in search of flowers. She took her leave, and hastened after it.
"I had now, however, learned that my former love was really in her father's house: while riding forward, I
employed myself in guessing whether it had been her cousin or she, that had secured the child from harm. I more
than once, in thought, repeated all the circumstances of the incident: I can remember few things that have affected
me more gratefully. But I feel that I am still unwell: we must ask the Doctor to deliver us from the remains of this
pathetic humour."
With confidential narratives of pretty love−adventures, it often happens as with ghost−stories; when the first is
told, the others follow of themselves.
Our little party, in recalling other times, found numerous passages of this description. Lothario had the most to
tell. Jarno's histories were all of one peculiar character: what Wilhelm could disclose we already know. He was
apprehensive they might mention his adventure with the Countess; but it was not hinted at, not even in the
remotest manner.
"It is true," observed Lothario, "there can scarcely any feeling in the world be more agreeable, than when the
heart, after a pause of indifference, again opens to love for some new object; yet I would forever have renounced
that happiness, had fate been pleased to unite me with Theresa. We are not always youths; we ought not always to
be children. To the man, who knows the world; who understands what he should do in it, what he should hope
from it, nothing can be more desirable than meeting with a wife who will everywhere cooperate with him, who
will everywhere prepare his way for him; whose diligence takes up what his must leave; whose occupation
spreads itself on every side, while his must travel forward on its single path. What a heaven had I figured for
myself beside Theresa! Not the heaven of an enthusiastic bliss; for of a sure life on earth: order in prosperity,
courage in adversity, care for the smallest, and a spirit capable of comprehending and managing the greatest. O! I
saw in her the qualities, which, when developed, make such women as we find in history, whose excellence
appears to us far preferable to that of men; this clearness of view; this expertness in all emergencies; this sureness
in details, which brings the whole so accurately out, although they never seem to think of it. You may well forgive
me," added he, and turned to Wilhelm with a smile, "that I forsook Aurelia for Theresa: with the one I could
Chapter VII

224

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
expect a calm and cheerful life, with the other not a happy hour."
"I will confess," said Wilhelm, "that in coming hither, I had no small anger in my heart against you; that I
proposed to censure with severity your conduct to Aurelia."
"It was really censurable," said Lothario: "I should not have exchanged my friendship for her with the sentiment
of love; I should not, in place of the respect which she deserved, have intruded an attachment she was neither
calculated to excite nor to maintain. Alas! she was not lovely when she loved; the greatest misery that can befall a
woman."
"Well, it is past!" said Wilhelm. "We cannot always shun the things we blame: in spite of us, our feelings and our
actions sometimes strangely swerve from their natural and right direction; yet there are certain duties which we
never should lose sight of. Peace be to the ashes of our friend! Without censuring ourselves or her, let us, with
sympathising hearts, strew flowers upon her grave. But at the grave in which the hapless mother sleeps, let me ask
why you acknowledge not the child; a son whom any father might rejoice in, and whom you appear entirely to
overlook? With your pure and tender nature, how can you altogether cast away the instinct of a parent? All this
while, you have not spent one syllable upon that precious creature, of whose attractions I could say so much."
"Whom do you speak of?" asked Lothario: "I do not understand you."
"Of whom but of your son, Aurelia's son, the lovely child, to whose good fortune there is nothing wanting, but
that a tender father should acknowledge and receive him."
"You mistake, my friend," exclaimed Lothario: "Aurelia never had a son, at least by me: I know of no child, or I
would with joy acknowledge it; and even in the present case, I will gladly look upon the little creature as a relic of
her, and take charge of educating it. But did she ever give you to believe that the boy was hers, was mine?"
"I cannot recollect that I ever heard a word from her expressly on the subject: but we took it up so, and I never for
a moment doubted it."
"I can give you something like a clue to this perplexity," said Jarno. "An old woman, whom you must have
noticed often, gave Aurelia the child: she accepted it with passion, hoping to alleviate her sorrows by its presence:
and, in truth, it gave her many a comfortable hour."
This discovery awoke anxieties in Wilhelm; he thought of his dear Mignon and his beautiful Felix with the
liveliest distinctness. He expressed his wish to remove them both from the state in which they were.
"We shall soon arrange it," said Lothario. "The little girl may be committed to Theresa; she cannot be in better
hands. As for the boy, I think you should yourself take charge of him: what in us the women leave uncultivated,
children cultivate, when we retain them near us."
"But first, I think," said Jarno, "you will once for all renounce the stage, as you have no talent for it."
Our friend was struck: he had to curb himself, for Jarno's harsh sentence had not a little wounded his self−love. "If
you convince me of that," replied he, forcing a smile, "you will do me a service; though it is but a mournful
service to rouse one from a pleasing dream."
"Without enlarging on the subject," answered Jarno, "I could merely wish you would go and fetch the children.
The rest will come in course."

Chapter VII

225

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
"I am ready," answered Wilhelm: "I am restless, and curious to see if I can get no farther knowledge of the boy: I
long to see the little girl, who has attached herself so strangely to me."
It was agreed that he should lose no time in setting out. Next day, he had prepared himself; his horse was saddled:
he only waited for Lothario, to take leave of him. At the dinner hour, they went as usual to table, not waiting for
the master of the house. He did not come till late; and then sat down by them.
"I could bet," said Jarno, "that today you have again been making trial of your tenderness of heart; you have not
been able to withstand the curiosity to see your quondam love."
"Guessed!" replied Lothario.
"Let us hear," said Jarno, "how it went: I long to know."
"I confess," replied Lothario, "the affair lay nearer my heart than it reasonably ought; so I formed the resolution of
again riding out, and actually seeing the person, whose renewed young image had affected me with such a
pleasing illusion. I alighted at some distance from the house, and sent the horses to a side, that the children, who
were playing at the door, might not be disturbed. I entered the house; by chance she met me just within the
threshold; it was herself; and I recognised her, notwithstanding the striking change. She had grown stouter, and
seemed to be larger: her gracefulness was shaded by a look of staidness; her vivacity had passed into a calm
reflectiveness. Her head, which she once bore so airily and freely, drooped a little; slight furrows had been traced
upon her brow.
"She cast down her eyes on seeing me; but no blush announced any inward movement of the heart. I held out my
hand to her, she gave me hers: I inquired about her husband, he was absent; about her children, she stept out and
called them; all came in and gathered round her. Nothing is more charming than to see a mother with a child upon
her arm; nothing is more reverend than a mother among many children. That I might say something, I asked the
name of the youngest. She desired me to walk in, and see her father: I agreed; she introduced me to the room,
where everything was standing almost just as I had left it; and what seemed stranger still, the fair cousin, her
living image, was sitting on the very seat behind the spinning−wheel, where I had found my love so often in the
self−same form. A little girl, the very figure of her mother, had come after us; and thus I stood in the most curious
scene, between the future and the past, as in a grove of oranges, where, within a little circle, flowers and fruits are
living, in successive stages of their growth, beside each other. The cousin went away to fetch us some
refreshment; I gave the woman I had loved so much my hand, and said to her: 'I feel a true joy in seeing you
again.' 'You are very good to say so,' answered she: 'but I also can assure you I feel the highest joy. How often
have I wished to see you once more in my life! I have wished it in moments, which I regarded as my last.' She
said this with a settled voice, without appearance of emotion, with that natural air which of old delighted me so
much. The cousin returned; the father with her: and I leave you to conceive with what feelings I remained, and
with what I came away."

Chapter VIII
IN his journey to the town, our friend was thinking of the lovely women whom he knew, or had heard of: their
curious fortunes, which contained so little happiness, were present to him with a sad distinctness. "Ah!" cried he,
"poor Mariana! What shall I yet learn of thee? And thou noble Amazon, glorious protecting spirit, to whom I owe
so much, whom I everywhere expect to meet, and nowhere see, in what mournful circumstances may I find thee,
shouldst thou again appear before me!"
On his arrival in the town, there was not one of his acquaintances at home: he hastened to the theatre; he supposed
they would be rehearsing. Here, however, all was still; the house seemed empty; one little door alone was open.
Chapter VIII

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Passing through it to the stage, he found Aurelia's ancient serving−maid, employed in sewing linen for a new
decoration: there was barely light enough to let her work. Felix and Mignon were sitting by her on the floor: they
had a book between them; and while Mignon read aloud, Felix was repeating all the words, as if he too knew his
letters, as if he too could read.
The children started up and ran to him: he embraced them with the tenderest feelings, and brought them closer to
the woman. "Art thou the person," said he to her, with an earnest voice, "from whom Aurelia received this child?"
She looked up from her work, and turned her face to him; he saw her in full light; he started back in terror; it was
old Barbara.
"Where is Mariana?" cried he.
"Far from here," replied the crone.
"And Felix?"
"Is the son of that unhappy, and too true and tenderhearted girl! May you never feel what you have made us
suffer! May the treasure which I now deliver you, make you as happy as he made us wretched!"
She arose to go away: Wilhelm held her fast. "I mean not to escape you," said she; "let me fetch a paper that will
make you glad and sorrowful."
She retired; and Wilhelm gazed upon the child with a painful joy: he durst not reckon him his own. "He is thine!"
cried Mignon; "he is thine!" and pressed the child to Wilhelm's knee.
Barbara came back, and handed him a letter. "Here are Mariana's last words," said she.
"She is dead!" cried he.
"Dead," said the old woman. "I wish to spare you all reproaches."
Astonished and confounded, Wilhelm broke up the letter; but scarcely had he read the first words of it, when a
bitter grief took hold of him; he let the letter fall; and sank upon a seat. Mignon hurried to him, trying to console
him. In the mean time, Felix had picked up the letter; he teased his playmate till she yielded, till she knelt beside
him, and read it over. Felix repeated the words, and Wilhelm was compelled to hear them twice. "If this sheet
should ever reach thee, then lament thy ill−starred friend. Thy love has caused her death. The boy, whose birth I
survive but a few days, is thine: I die faithful to thee, much as appearances may be against me: with thee I lost
everything that bound me to life. I die content; for they have assured me that the child is healthy and will live.
Listen to old Barbara; forgive her; farewell, and forget me not."
What a painful, and yet to his comfort, half−enigmatic letter! Its contents pierced through his heart, as the
children, stuttering and stammering, pronounced and repeated them.
"There you have it now!" said the crone, not waiting till he had recovered. "Thank Heaven that having lost so true
a love, you have still so fine a child remaining. Your grief will be unequalled, when you learn how the poor good
girl stood faithful to you to the end; how miserable she became, and what she sacrificed for your sake."
"Let me drain the cup of sorrow and of joy at once!" cried Wilhelm. "Convince me, even persuade me that she
was a good girl, that she deserved respect as well as love; then leave me to my grief for her irreparable loss."

Chapter VIII

"It is not yet time," said Barbara; "I have work to do, and I would not we were seen together. Let it be a secret that
Felix is your son: I should have too much abuse to suffer from the company, for having formerly deceived them.
Mignon will not betray us; she is good and close."
"I have known it long, and I said nothing," answered Mignon. "How is it possible?" cried Barbara. "Whence?"
cried Wilhelm.
"The spirit told it me."
"Where? Where?"
"In the vault, when the old man drew his knife, it called to me: 'Bring his father,' and I thought it must be thou."
"Who called to thee?"
"I know not; in my heart, in my head, I was terrified; I trembled, I prayed, then it called, and I understood it."
Wilhelm pressed her to his heart; recommended Felix to her, and retired. He had not observed till then that she
was grown much paler and thinner than when he left her. Madam Melina was the first acquaintance he met: she
received him in the friendliest manner. "O, that you might find everything among us as you wished!" exclaimed
she.
"I doubt it," answered Wilhelm; "I do not expect it Confess that they have taken all their measures to dispense
with me."
"Why would you go away?" replied his friend.
"We cannot soon enough convince ourselves," said he, "how very simply we may be dispensed with in the world.
What important personages we conceive ourselves to be! We think that it is we alone who animate the circle we
move in; that, in our absence, life, nourishment and breath will make a general pause: and, alas, the void which
occurs is scarcely remarked, so soon is it filled up again; nay it is often but the place, if not for something better,
at least for something more agreeable."
"And the sorrows of our friends we are not to take into account?"
"For our friends, too, it is well, when they soon recover their composure, when they say each to himself: There
where thou art, there where thou remainest, accomplish what thou canst; be busy, be courteous, and let the present
scene delight thee."
On a narrower inquiry, he found what he had looked for; the opera had been set up, and was exclusively attracting
the attention of the public. His parts had in the mean while been distributed between Horatio and Laertes; and
both of them were in the habit of eliciting from the spectators far more liberal applause than he had ever been
enabled to obtain.
Laertes entered, and Madam Melina cried: "Look you here at this lucky fellow: he is soon to be a capitalist, or
Heaven knows what!" Wilhelm, in embracing him, discovered that his coat was superfine: the rest of his apparel
was simple, but of the very best materials.
"Solve me the riddle!" cried our friend.

Chapter VIII

228

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
"You are still in time to learn," replied Laertes, "that my running to and fro is now about to be repaid; that a
partner in a large commercial house is turning to advantage my acquirements from books or observation, and
allowing me a share with him. I would give something, could I purchase back my confidence in women: there is a
pretty niece in the house; and I see well enough that, if I pleased, I might soon be a made man."
"You have not heard," said Frau Melina, "that a marriage has already taken place among ourselves? Serlo is
actually wedded to the fair Elmira; her father would not tolerate their secret correspondence."
They talked, in this manner, about many things that had occurred while he was absent: nor was it difficult for him
to observe, that, according to the present temper and constitution of the company, his dismissal had already taken
place.
He impatiently expected Barbara, who had appointed him to wait for her far in the night. She was to come when
all were sleeping; she required as many preparations as if she had been the youngest maiden gliding in to her
beloved. Meanwhile he read, a hundred times, the letter she had given him; read with unspeakable delight the
word faithful in the hand of his darling; with horror the announcement of her death, whose approaches she
appeared to view unmoved.
Midnight was past, when something rustled at the half−open door, and Barbara came in with a little basket. "I am
to tell you the story of our woes," said she; "and I must believe that you will sit unmoved at the recital; that you
are waiting for me but to satisfy your curiosity; that you will now, as you did formerly, retire within your cold
selfishness, while our hearts are breaking. But look you here! Thus, on that happy evening, did I bring you the
bottle of champagne; thus did I place the three glasses on the table: and as you then began, with soft nursery tales,
to cozen us and lull us asleep, so will I now with stern truths instruct you and keep you waking."
Wilhelm knew not what to say when the old woman in fact let go the cork, and filled the three glasses to the brim.
"Drink!" cried she, having emptied at a draught her foaming glass. "Drink, ere the spirit of it pass! This third glass
shall froth away untasted to the memory of my unhappy Mariana. How red were her lips, when she then drank
your health! Ah, and now forever pale and cold!"
"Siby! Fury!" cried Wilhelm, springing up and striking the table with his fist, "what evil spirit possesses thee and
drives thee? For what dost thou take me, that thou thinkest the simplest narrative of Mariana's death and sorrows
will not harrow me enough, but usest these hellish arts to sharpen my torment? If thy unsatiable greediness is
such, that thou must revel at the funeral table, drink and speak! I have loathed thee from of old; and I cannot
reckon Mariana guiltless while I even look upon thee, her companion."
"Softly, mein herr!" replied the crone; "you shall not ruffle me. Your debts to us are deep and dark: the railing of a
debtor does not anger one. But you are right: the simplest narrative will punish you sufficiently. Hear, then, the
struggle and the victory of Mariana striving to continue yours."
"Continue mine?" cried Wilhelm: "what fable dost thou mean to tell me?"
"Interrupt me not," said she, "hear me, and then give what belief you list: to me it is all one. Did you not, the last
night you were with us, find a letter in the room and take it with you?"
"I found the letter after I had taken it with me: it was lying in the neckerchief, which, in the warmth of my love, I
had seized and carried off."
"What did the sheet contain?"

Chapter VIII

229

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
"The expectation of an angry lover to be better treated on the next, than he had been on the preceding evening.
And that you kept your word to him, I need not be told; for I saw him with my own eyes gliding from your house
before daybreak."
"You may have seen him: but what occurred within; how sadly Mariana passed that night, how fretfully I passed
it, you are yet to learn. I will be altogether candid; I will neither hide nor palliate the fact, that I persuaded
Mariana to yield to the solicitations of a certain Norberg: it was with repugnance that she followed my advice, nay
that she even heard it. He was rich; he seemed attached; I hoped he would be constant. Soon after, he was forced
to go upon his journey, and Mariana became acquainted with you. What had I then to abide! What to hinder, what
to undergo! 'O!' cried she often, 'hadst thou spared my youth, my innocence but four short weeks, I might have
found a worthy object of my love; I had then been worthy of him, and love might have given, with a quiet
conscience, what now I have sold against my will.' She entirely abandoned herself to her affection for you: I need
not ask if you were happy. Over her understanding I had an unbounded power; for I knew the means of satisfying
all her little inclinations: but over her heart I had no control; for she never sanctioned what I did for her, what I
counselled her to do, when her heart said nay. It was only to irresistible necessity that she would yield: but ere
long the necessity appeared to her extremely pressing. In the first period of her youth, she had never known want:
by a complication of misfortunes her people lost their fortune; the poor girl had been used to have a number of
conveniences; and upon her young spirit certain principles of honour had been stamped, which made her restless,
without much helping her. She had not the smallest skill in worldly matters; she was innocent in the strictest
meaning of the word. She had no idea that one could buy without paying: nothing frightened her more than being
in debt; she always rather liked to give than take. This, and this alone, was what made it possible, that she could
be constrained to give herself away, in order to get rid of various little debts which weighed upon her."
"And couldst not thou," cried Wilhelm in an angry tone, "have saved her?"
"O yes!" replied the beldame; "with hunger and need; with sorrow and privation: but for this I was not disposed."
"Abominable, base procuress! So thou hast sacrificed the hapless creature? Offered her up to thy throat, to thy
insatiable maw?"
"It were better to compose yourself and cease your reviling," said the dame. "If you will revile, go to your high
noble houses: there you will meet with many a mother full of anxious cares to find out for some lovely heavenly
maiden the most odious of men, provided he be the richest. See the poor creature shivering and faltering before
her fate; and nowhere finding consolation, till some more experienced female lets her understand, that by
marriage she acquires the right in future, to dispose of her heart and person as she pleases."
"Peace!" cried Wilhelm: "dost thou think that one crime can be the excuse of another? To thy story, without
farther observations!"
"Do you listen then, without blaming! Mariana became yours against my will. In this adventure at least I have
nothing to reproach myself with. Norberg returned; he made haste to visit Mariana: she received him coldly and
angrily; would not even admit him to a kiss. I employed all my art in apologising for her conduct; gave him to
understand that her confessor had awakened her conscience; that so long as conscientious scruples lasted one was
bound to respect them. I at last so far succeeded that he went away; I promising to do my utmost for him. He was
rich and rude; but there was a touch of goodness in him, and he loved Mariana without limit. He promised to be
patient; and I laboured with the greatest ardour not to try him too far. With Mariana I had stubborn contest: I
persuaded her, nay I may call it forced her, by the threat of leaving her, to write to Norberg and invite him for the
night. You came, and by chance picked up his answer in the neckerchief. Your presence broke my game. For
scarcely were you gone, when she anew began her lamentation: she swore she would not be unfaithful to you; she
was so passionate, so frantic, that I could not help sincerely pitying her. In the end, I promised, that for this night
also, I would pacify her lover, and send him off, under some pretence or other. I entreated her to go to bed; but
Chapter VIII

230

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
she did not seem to trust me; she kept on her clothes, and at last fell asleep, without undressing, agitated and
exhausted with weeping as she was.
"Norberg came: representing in the blackest hues her conscientious agonies and her repentance, I endeavoured to
retain him: he wished to see her, and I went into the room to prepare her; he followed me, and both of us at once
came forward to her bed. She awoke; sprang wildly up, and tore herself from our arms: she conjured and begged,
she entreated, threatened and declared she would not yield. She was improvident enough to let fall some words
about the true state of her affections; which poor Norberg had to understand in a spiritual sense. At length he left
her, and she locked her door. I kept him long with me, and talked with him about her situation: I told him that she
was with child; that, poor girl, she should be humoured. He was so delighted with his fatherhood, with his
prospect of a boy, that he granted everything she wished; he promised rather to set out travel for a time, then vex
his dear, and injure her by these internal troubles. With such intentions, at an early hour he glided out; and if you,
mein herr, stood sentry by our house, there was nothing wanting to your happiness, but to have looked into the
bosom of your rival, whom you thought so favoured and so fortunate, and whose appearance drove you to
despair."
"Art thou speaking truth?" said Wilhelm.
"True," said the crone, "as I still hope to drive you to despair.
"Yes, certainly you would despair, if I could rightly paint to you the following morning. How cheerfully did she
awake; how kindly did she call me in; how warmly thank me, how cordially press me to her bosom! 'Now,' said
she, stepping up to her mirror with a smile, 'can I again take pleasure in myself, and in my looks, since once more
I am my own, am his, my one beloved friend's. How sweet is it to conquer! How I thank thee for taking charge of
me; for having turned thy prudence and thy understanding, once, at least, to my advantage! Stand by me, and
devise the means of making me entirely happy!'
"I assented, would not irritate her; I flattered her hopes, and she caressed me tenderly. If she retired but a moment
from the window, I was made to stand and watch; for you, of course, would pass; for she at least would see you.
Thus did we spend the restless day. At night, at the accustomed hour, we looked for you with certainty. I was
already out waiting at the staircase; I grew weary, and came in to her again. With surprise, I found her in her
military dress: she looked cheerful, and charming beyond what I had ever seen her. 'Do I not deserve,' said she, 'to
appear tonight in man's apparel? Have I not struggled bravely? My dearest shall see me as he saw me for the first
time. I will press him as tenderly and with greater freedom to my heart than then; for am not I his much more than
I was then, when a noble resolution had not freed me? But,' added she, after pausing for a little, 'I have not yet
entirely won him; I must still risk the uttermost, in order to be worthy, to be certain of possessing him; I must
disclose the whole to him, discover to him all my state, then leave it to himself to keep or to reject me. This scene
I am preparing for my friend, preparing for myself: and were his feelings capable of casting me away, I should
then belong again entirely to myself; my punishment would bring me consolation, I would suffer all that fate
could lay upon me.'
"With such purposes and hopes, mein herr, this lovely girl expected you: you came not. O! how shall I describe
the state of watching and of hope? I see thee still before me; with what love, what heartfelt love, thou spokest of
the man, whose cruelty thou hadst not yet experienced!"
"Good, dear Barbara!" cried Wilhelm, springing up, and seizing the old woman by the hand, "we have had enough
of mummery and preparation! Thy indifferent, thy calm, contented tone betrays thee. Give me back my Mariana!
She is living, she is near at hand. Not in vain didst thou choose this late lonely hour to visit me: not in vain hast
thou prepared me by thy most delicious narrative. Where is she? Where hast thou hidden her? I believe all, I will
promise to believe all, so thou but show her to me, so thou give her to my arms. The shadow of her I have seen
already: let me clasp her once more to my bosom. I will kneel before her, I will entreat forgiveness; I will
Chapter VIII

231

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
congratulate her upon her victory over herself and thee; I will bring my Felix to her. Come! where hast thou
concealed her? Leave her, leave me no longer in uncertainty! Thy object is attained. Where hast thou hidden her?
Let me light thee with this candle, let me once more see her fair and kindly face!"
He had pulled old Barbara from her chair: she stared at him; tears started into her eyes, wild pangs of grief took
hold of her. "What luckless error," cried she, "leaves you still a moment's hope? Yes, I have hidden her; but
beneath the ground: neither the light of the sun, nor any social taper shall again illuminate her kindly face. Take
the boy Felix to her grave, and say to him: 'There lies thy mother, whom thy father doomed unheard.' The heart of
Mariana beats no longer with impatience to behold you; not in a neighbouring chamber is she waiting the
conclusion of my narrative, or fable; the dark chamber has received her, to which no bridegroom follows, from
which none comes to meet a lover."
She cast herself upon the floor beside a chair, and wept bitterly. Wilhelm now, for the first time, felt entirely
convinced that Mariana was no more; his emotions it is easy to conceive. The old woman rose: "I have nothing
more to tell you," cried she, and threw a packet on the table. "Here are some writings that will put your cruelty to
shame: peruse these sheets with unwet eyes, if you can." She glided softly out. Our friend had not the heart to
open the pocket−book that night: he had himself presented it to Mariana; he knew that she had carefully preserved
in it every letter he had sent her. Next morning he prevailed upon himself: he untied the ribbon; little notes came
forward written with pencil in his own hand; and recalled to him every situation, from the first day of their
graceful acquaintance to the last of their stern separation. In particular, it was not without acute anguish, that he
read a small series of billets, which had been addressed to himself, and to which, as he saw from their tenor,
Werner had refused admittance. "No one of my letters has yet penetrated to thee; my entreaties, my prayers have
not reached thee; was it thyself that gave these cruel orders? Shall I never see thee more? Yet again I attempt it: I
entreat thee, come, O come! I ask not to retain thee, if I might but once more press thee to my heart." "When I
used to sit beside thee, holding thy hands, looking in thy eyes; and with the full heart of love and trust to call thee,
'Dear, dear good Wilhelm!' it would please thee so, that I had to repeat it over and over. I repeat it once again:
'Dear, dear good Wilhelm! Be good as thou wert; come, and leave me not to perish in my wretchedness."' "Thou
regardest me as guilty: I am so; but not as thou thinkest. Come, let me have this single comfort to be altogether
known to thee; let what will befall me afterwards." "Not for my sake alone, for thy own too, I beg of thee to come.
I feel the intolerable pains thou art suffering, whilst thou fliest from me. Come, that our separation may be less
cruel! Perhaps I was never worthy of thee till this moment, when thou art repelling me to boundless woe." "By all
that is holy, by all that can touch a human heart, I call upon thee! It involves the safety of a soul, it involves a life,
two lives, one of which must ever be dear to thee. This, too, thy suspicion will discredit: yet I will speak it in the
hour of death: the child which I carry under my heart is thine. Since I began to love thee, no other man has even
pressed my hand: O that thy love, that thy uprightness, had been the companions of my youth!" "Thou wilt not
hear me? I must even be silent. But these letters will not die; perhaps they will speak to thee, when the shroud is
covering my lips, and the voice of thy repentance cannot reach my ear. Through my weary life, to the last
moment, this will be my only comfort: that though I cannot call myself blameless, towards thee I am free from
blame."
Wilhelm could proceed no farther: he resigned himself entirely to his sorrow; which became still more afflicting,
when, Laertes entering, he was obliged to hide his feelings. Laertes showed a purse of ducats; and began to count
and reckon them, assuring Wilhelm that there could be nothing finer in the world than for a man to feel himself in
the way to wealth; that nothing then could trouble or detain him. Wilhelm bethought him of his dream, and
smiled; but at the same time, he remembered with a shudder, that in his vision Mariana had forsaken him, to
follow his departed father, and that both of them at last had moved about the garden, hovering in the air like
spirits.
Laertes forced him from his meditations; he brought him to a coffee−house, where, immediately on Wilhelm's
entrance, several persons gathered round him. They were men who had applauded his performance on the stage:
they expressed their joy at meeting him; lamenting that, as they had heard, he meant to leave the theatre. They
Chapter VIII

232

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
spoke so reasonably and kindly of himself and his acting, of his talent and their hopes from it, that Wilhelm, not
without emotion, cried at last: "O how infinitely precious would such sympathy have been to me some months
ago! How instructive, how encouraging! Never had I turned my mind so totally from the concerns of the stage,
never had I gone so far as to despair of the public."
"So far as this," said an elderly man who now stept forward, "we should never go. The public is large; true
judgment, true feeling, are not quite so rare as one believes; only the artist ought not to demand an unconditional
approval of his work. Unconditional approval is always the least valuable; conditional you gentlemen are not
content with. In life, as in art, I know well, a person must take counsel with himself when he purposes to do or to
produce anything: but when it is produced or done, he must listen with attention to the voices of a number, and
with a little practice, out of these many votes he will be able to collect a perfect judgment. The few, who could
themselves pronounce one, for the most part hold their peace."
"This they should not do," said Wilhelm. "I have often heard people, who themselves kept silence in regard to
works of merit, complaining and lamenting that silence was kept."
"Today, then, we will speak aloud," cried a young man: "You must dine with us, and we will try to pay off a little
of the debt we have owed to you, and sometimes also to our good Aurelia."
This invitation Wilhelm courteously declined: he went to Frau Melina, whom he wished to speak with on the
subject of the children, as he meant to take them from her.
Old Barbara's secret was not too religiously observed by him. He betrayed himself so soon as he again beheld the
lovely Felix. "O my child!" cried he; "My dear child!" He lifted him, and pressed him to his heart. "Father! what
hast thou brought for me?" cried the child. Mignon looked at both, as if she meant to warn them not to blab.
"What new phenomenon is this?" said Frau Melina. They got the children sent away; and Wilhelm, thinking that
he did not owe old Barbara the strictest secrecy, disclosed the whole affair to Frau Melina. She viewed him with a
smile.
"O! these credulous men!" exclaimed she. "If anything is lying in their path, it is so easy to impose it on them;
while in other cases they will neither look to the right nor left, and can value nothing, which they have not
previously impressed with the stamp of an arbitrary passion!" She sighed, against her will. If our friend had not
been altogether blind, he must have noticed in her conduct an affection for him which had never been entirely
subdued.
He now spoke with her about the children; how he purposed to keep Felix with him, and to place Mignon in the
country. Madame Melina, though sorry at the thought of parting with them, said the plan was good, nay
absolutely necessary. Felix was becoming wild with her; and Mignon seemed to need fresh air and other
occupation; she was sickly, and was not yet recovering.
"Let it not mislead you," added Frau Melina, "that I have lightly hinted doubts about the boy's being really yours.
The old woman, it is true, deserves but little confidence; yet a person who invents untruths for her advantage may
likewise speak the truth when truths are profitable to her. Aurelia she had hoodwinked to believe that Felix was
Lothario's son: and it is a property of us women that we cordially like the children of our lovers, though we do not
know the mothers, or even hate them from the heart." Felix came jumping in; she pressed him to her with a
tenderness which was not usual to her. Wilhelm hastened home, and sent for Barbara; who, however, would not
undertake to meet him till the twilight. He received her angrily. "There is nothing in the world more shameful,"
said he, "than establishing oneself on lies and fables. Already thou hast done much mischief with them; and now
when thy word could decide the fortune of my life, now must I stand dubious, not venturing to call the child my
own, though to possess him without scruple would form my highest happiness. I cannot look upon thee,
Chapter VIII

233

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
scandalous creature, without hatred and contempt."
"Your conduct, if I speak with candour," said the old woman, "appears to me intolerable. Even if Felix were not
yours, he is the fairest and the loveliest child in nature; one might purchase him at any price, to have him always
near one. Is he not worthy your acceptance? Do not I deserve for my care, for the labour I have had with him, a
little pension for the small remainder of my life? O, you gentlemen who know no want! It is well for you to talk
of truth and honour: but how the miserable being whose smallest necessity is unprovided for, who sees in her
perplexities no friend, no help, no counsel; how she is to press through the crowd of selfish men, and to starve in
silence, you are seldom at the trouble to consider. Did you read Mariana's letters? They are the letters she wrote to
you at that unhappy season. It was in vain that I attempted to approach you to deliver you these sheets: your
savage brother−in−law had so begirt you that craft and cunning were of no avail; and at last, when he began to
threaten me and Mariana with imprisonment, I had then to cease my efforts, and renounced all hope. Does not
everything agree with what I told you? And does not Norberg's letter put the story altogether out of doubt?"
"What letter?" asked he.
"Did you not find it in the pocket−book?" said Barbara.
"I have not yet read all of them."
"Give me the pocket−book: on that paper everything depends. Norberg's luckless billet caused this sorrowful
perplexity; another from his hand may loose the knots, so far as aught may still depend upon unravelling them."
She took a letter from the book; Wilhelm recognised that odious writing; he constrained himself and read:
"Tell me, girl, how hast thou got such power over me? I would not have believed that a goddess herself could
make a sighing lover of me. Instead of hastening towards me with open arms, thou shrankest back from me: one
might have taken it for aversion. Is it fair that I should spend the night with old Barbara, sitting on a trunk, and but
two doors between me and my pretty Mariana? It is too bad, I tell thee! I have promised to allow thee time to
think; not to press thee unrelentingly; I could run mad at every wasted quarter of an hour. Have not I given thee
gifts according to my power? Dost thou still doubt of my love? What wilt thou have? Do but tell me: thou shalt
want for nothing. Would the Devil had the priest that put such stuff into thy head! Why didst thou go to such a
churl? There are plenty of them that allow young people somewhat. Enough! I tell thee things must alter: in two
days I must have an answer; for I am to leave the town; and if thou become not kind and friendly to me, thou shalt
never see me more.. . .."
In this style, the letter spun itself to great length; turning, to Wilhelm's painful satisfaction, still about the same
point; and testifying for the truth of the account which he had got from Barbara. A second letter clearly proved,
that Mariana in the sequel also had maintained her purpose; and it was not without heartfelt grief that out of these
and other papers Wilhelm learned the history of the unlucky girl to the very hour of her death.
Barbara had gradually tamed the rude Norberg, by announcing to him Mariana's death, and leaving him in the
belief, that Felix was his son. Once or twice he had sent her money; which, however, she retained for herself,
having talked Aurelia into taking charge of the child. But unhappily this secret source of riches did not long
endure. Norberg by a life of riot had impaired his fortune; and by repeated love−affairs his heart was rendered
callous to his supposed first−born.
Probable as all this seemed, beautifully as it all agreed. Wilhelm did not venture to give way to joy. He still
appeared to dread a present coming from his evil Genius.
"Your jealous fears," said Barbara, who guessed his mood of mind, "time alone can cure. Look upon the child as a
stranger one; take stricter heed of him on that account; observe his gifts, his temper, his capacities; and if you do

not, by and by, discover in him the exact resemblance of yourself, your eyes must certainly be bad. Of this I can
assure you, were I a man, no one should foist a child on me: but it is a happiness for women, that in these cases
men are not so quick of sight."
These things over, Wilhelm and Barbara parted; he was to take Felix with him; she to carry Mignon to Theresa,
and afterwards to live in any place she pleased, upon a small annuity which he engaged to settle on her.
He sent for Mignon, to prepare her for the new arrangement. "Master!" said she, "keep me with thee: it will do me
good and do me ill."
He told her that, as she was now grown up, there should be something farther done for her instruction. "I am
sufficiently instructed," answered she, "to love and grieve."
He directed her attention to her health, and showed that she required continuous care, and the direction of a good
physician. "Why care for me," said she, "when there are so many things to care for?"
After he had laboured greatly to persuade her that he could not take her with him, that he would conduct her to a
place where he might often see her, she appeared as if she had not heard a word of it. "Thou wishest not to have
me with thee?" said she. "Perhaps it is better; send me to the old Harper; the poor man is lonely where he is."
Wilhelm tried to show her that the old man was in comfortable circumstances. "Every hour I long for him,"
replied the child.
"I did not see," said Wilhelm, "that thou wert so fond of him when he was living with us."
"I was frightened for him, when he was awake; I could not bear his eyes; but when he was asleep, I liked so well
to sit by him! I used to chase the flies from him; I could not look at him enough. O! he has stood by me in fearful
moments; none knows how much I owe him. Had I known the road, I should have run away to him already."
Wilhelm set the circumstances in detail before her; he said, that she had always been a reasonable child, and that
on this occasion also she might do as she desired. "Reason is cruel," said she; "the heart is better; I will go as thou
requirest, only leave me Felix."
After much discussion, her opinion was not altered; and Wilhelm at last resolved on giving Barbara both the
children, and sending them together to Theresa. This was the easier for him, as he still feared to look upon the
lovely Felix as his son. He would take him on his arm, and carry him about: the child delighted to be held before
the glass; Wilhelm also liked, though unavowedly, to hold him there, and seek resemblances between their faces.
If for a moment any striking similarity appeared between them, he would press the boy in his arms; and then at
once affrighted by the thought that he might be mistaken, he would set him down, and let him run away. "O!"
cried he, "if I were to appropriate this priceless treasure, and it were then to be snatched from me, I should be the
most unhappy man on earth!"
The children had been sent away; and Wilhelm was about to take a formal leave of the theatre, when he felt that in
reality he had already taken leave, and needed but to go. Mariana was no more; his two guardian spirits had
departed, and his thoughts hied after them. The fair boy hovered like a beautiful uncertain vision in the eyes of his
imagination: he saw him, at Theresa's hand, running through the fields and woods, forming his mind and person,
in the free air, beside a free and cheerful foster−mother. Theresa had become far dearer to him since he figured
her in company with Felix. Even while sitting in the theatre, he thought of her with smiles; he was almost in her
own case, the stage could now produce no more illusion in him.

Serlo and Melina were excessively polite to him, when they observed that he was making no pretensions to his
former place. A portion of the public wished to see him act again: this he could not accede to; nor in the company
did any one desire it, saving Frau Melina.
Of this friend he now took leave; he was moved at parting with her; he exclaimed: "Why do we presume to
promise anything depending on an unknown future? The most slight engagement we have not power to keep; far
less a purpose of importance. I feel ashamed in recollecting what I promised to you all, in that unhappy night,
when we were lying plundered, sick and wounded, crammed into a miserable tavern. How did misfortune elevate
my courage; what a treasure did I think I had found in my good wishes! And of all this not a jot has taken effect. I
leave you as your debtor: and my comfort is, that our people prized my promise at its actual worth, and never
more took notice of it."
"Be not unjust to yourself," said Frau Melina: "if no one acknowledges what you have done for us, I at least will
not forget it. Our whole condition had been different, if you had not been with us. But it is with our purposes as
with our wishes. They seem no longer what they were, when they have been accomplished, been fulfilled; and we
think we have done, have wished for nothing."
"You shall not, by your friendly statement," answered Wilhelm, "put my conscience to peace. I shall always look
upon myself as in your debt."
"Nay, perhaps you are so," said Madam Melina; "but not in the manner you suppose. We reckon it a shame to fail
in the fulfilment of a promise we have uttered with the voice. O my friend, a worthy person by his very presence
promises us much! The confidence which he elicits, the inclination he inspires, the hopes which he awakens are
unbounded: he is, and he continues, in our debt, although he does not know it. Fare you well! If our external
circumstances have been happily repaired by your direction, there is a void produced by your departure, in my
mind, which will not be so easily filled up again."
Before leaving the city, Wilhelm wrote a copious sheet to Werner. He had before exchanged some letters; but, not
being able to agree, they had at length ceased to write. Now, however, Wilhelm had again approximated to his
brother; he was just about to do what Werner had so earnestly desired. He could say: 'I am abandoning the stage: I
mean to join myself with men whose intercourse, in every sense, must lead me to a sure and suitable activity.' He
inquired about his property: and it now seemed strange to him, that he had never for so long a time disturbed
himself about it. He knew not that it is the manner of all persons who attach importance to their inward
cultivation, altogether to neglect their outward circumstances. This had been Wilhelm's case: he now for the first
time seemed to notice, that to work effectively, he stood in need of outward means. He entered on his journey,
this time, in a temper altogether different from that of last; the prospects he had in view were charming; he hoped
to meet with something cheerful by the way.

Chapter IX
ON returning to Lothario's Castle, Wilhelm found that changes had occurred. Jarno met him with the tidings, that
Lothario's uncle being dead, the Baron had himself set out to take possession of the heritage. "You come in time,"
said he, "to help the Abbé and me. Lothario has commissioned us to purchase some extensive properties of land in
this quarter: he has long contemplated the bargain, and we have now got cash and credit just in season. The only
point which made us hesitate was, that a distant trading house had also views upon the same estates; at length we
have determined to make common cause with it, as otherwise we might outbid each other without need or reason.
The trader seems to be a prudent man. At present we are making estimates and calculations: we must also settle
economically how the lands are to be shared, so that each of us may have a fine estate." The papers were
submitted to our friend; the fields, meadows, houses, were inspected; and though Jarno and the Abbé seemed to
understand the matter fully, Wilhelm could not help desiring that Theresa had been with them.
Chapter IX

236

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
In these labours several days were spent, and Wilhelm had scarcely time to tell his friends of his adventures and
his dubious fatherhood. This incident, to him so interesting, they treated with indifference and levity.
He had noticed, that they frequently in confidential conversation, while at table or in walks, would suddenly stop
short and give their words another application, thereby showing, at least, that they had on the anvil many things
which were concealed from him. He bethought him of what Lydia had said; and he put the greater faith in it, as
one entire division of the Castle had always been inaccessible to him. The way to certain galleries, particularly to
the ancient tower, with which externally he was so well acquainted, he had often sought, and hitherto in vain.
One evening Jarno said to him: "We can now consider you as ours, with such security, that it were unjust if we
did not introduce you deeper into our mysteries. It is right that a man, when he first enters upon life, should think
highly of himself, should determine to attain many eminent distinctions, should endeavour to make all things
possible; but when his education has proceeded to a certain pitch, it is advantageous for him that he learn to lose
himself among a mass of men, that he learn to live for the sake of others, and to forget himself in an activity
prescribed by duty. It is then that he first becomes acquainted with himself; for it is conduct alone that compares
us with others. You shall soon see what a curious little world is at your very hand, and how well you are known in
it. Tomorrow morning before sunrise be dressed and ready."
Jarno came at the appointed hour: he led our friend through certain known and unknown chambers of the Castle,
then through several galleries; till at last they reached a large old door, strongly framed with iron. Jarno knocked;
the door went up a little, so as to admit one person. Jarno introduced our friend, and did not follow him. Wilhelm
found himself in an obscure and narrow stand; all was dark round him: and when he tried to go a step forward, he
found himself hemmed in. A voice not altogether strange to him cried: "Enter!" and he now discovered that the
sides of the place where he was were merely hung with tapestry, through which a feeble light glimmered in to
him. "Enter!" cried the voice again: he raised the tapestry and entered.
The hall, in which he now stood, appeared to have at one time been a chapel; instead of the altar he observed a
large table raised some steps above the floor, and covered with a green cloth hanging over it. On the top of this, a
drawn curtain seemed as if it hid a picture; on the sides were spaces beautifully worked, and covered−in with fine
wire netting, like the shelves of a library; only here, instead of books, a multitude of rolls had been inserted.
Nobody was in the hall, the rising sun shone through the window, right on Wilhelm, and kindly saluted him as he
came in.
"Be seated!" cried a voice, which seemed to issue from the altar. Wilhelm placed himself in a small arm−chair,
which stood against the tapestry where he had entered. There was no seat but this in the room; Wilhelm had to be
content with it, though the morning radiance dazzled him; the chair stood fast, he could only keep his hand before
his eyes.
But now the curtain, which hung down above the altar, went asunder with a gentle rustling; and showed, within a
picture−frame, a dark empty aperture. A man stept forward at it, in a common dress; saluted the astonished
looker−on, and said to him: "Do you not recognise me? Among the many things which you would like to know,
do you feel no curiosity to learn where your grandfather's collection of pictures and statues are at present? Have
you forgot the painting which you once so much delighted in? Where, think, you, is the sick king's son now
languishing?" Wilhelm, without difficulty recognised the stranger, whom, in that important night, he had
conversed with at the inn. "Perhaps," continued his interrogator, "we should now be less at variance in regard to
Destiny and Character."
Wilhelm was about to answer, when the curtain quickly flew together. "Strange!" said Wilhelm to himself: "Can
chance occurrences have a connexion? Is what we call Destiny but Chance? Where is my grandfather's collection;
and why am I remembered of it in these solemn moments?"

Chapter IX

237

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
He had not leisure to pursue his thoughts: the curtain once more parted; and a person stood before him, whom he
instantly perceived to be the country clergyman, that had attended him and his companions on that pleasure sail of
theirs. He had a resemblance to the Abbé, though he seemed to be a different person. With a cheerful
countenance, in a tone of dignity, he said: "To guard from error, is not the instructor's duty; but to lead the erring
pupil; nay, to let him quaff his error in deep satiating draughts, this is the instructor's wisdom. He who only tastes
his error, will long dwell with it, will take delight in it as in a singular felicity: while he who drains it to the dregs
will, if he be not crazy, find it out." The curtain closed again; and Wilhelm had a little time to think. "What error
can he mean," said he within himself, "but the error which has clung to me through my whole life; that I sought
for cultivation where it was not to be found; that I fancied I could form a talent in me, while without the smallest
gift for it."
The curtain dashed asunder faster than before; an officer advanced, and said in passing: "Learn to know the men
who may be trusted!" The curtain closed; and Wilhelm did not long consider, till he found this officer to be the
one who had embraced him in the Count's park, and had caused his taking Jarno for a crimp. How that stranger
had come hither, who he was, were riddles to our friend. "If so many men," cried he, "took interest in thee, knew
thy way of life, and how it should be carried on, why did they not conduct thee with greater strictness, with
greater seriousness? Why did they favour thy silly sports, instead of drawing thee away from them?"
"Dispute not with us!" cried a voice: "Thou art saved, thou art on the way to the goal. None of thy follies wilt thou
repent; none wilt thou wish to repeat; no luckier destiny can be allotted to a man." The curtain went asunder; and
in full armour stood the old King of Denmark in the space. "I am thy father's spirit," said the figure, "and I depart
in comfort, since my wishes for thee are accomplished, in a higher sense than I myself contemplated. Steep
regions cannot be surmounted save by winding paths; on the plain, straight roads conduct from place to place.
Farewell, and think of me, when thou enjoyest what I have provided for thee."
Wilhelm was exceedingly amazed and struck: he thought it was his father' voice; and yet in truth it was not: the
present and the past alike confounded and perplexed him.
He had not meditated long, when the Abbé came to view, and placed himself behind the green table. "Come
hither!" cried he to his marvelling friend. He went, and mounted up the steps. On the green cloth lay a little roll.
"Here is your indenture," said the Abbé: "take it to heart; it is of weighty import." Wilhelm lifted, opened it, and
read:INDENTUREArt is long, life short, judgment difficult, opportunity transient. To act is easy, to think is hard;
to act according to our thought is troublesome. Every beginning is cheerful; the threshold is the place of
expectation. The boy stands astonished, his impressions guide him; he learns sportfully, seriousness comes on him
by surprise. Imitation is born with us; what should be imitated is not easy to discover. The excellent is rarely
found, more rarely valued. The height charms us, the steps to it do not: with the summit in our eye, we love to
walk along the plain. It is but a part of art that can be taught; the artist needs it all. Who knows it half, speaks
much, and is always wrong; who knows it wholly, inclines to act, and speaks seldom or late. The former have no
secrets and no force: the instruction they can give is like baked bread, savoury and satisfying for a single day; but
flour cannot be sown and seed−corn ought not to be ground. Words are good, but they are not the best. The best is
not to be explained by words. The spirit in which we act is the highest matter. Action can be understood and again
represented by the spirit alone. No one knows what he is doing, while he acts aright; but of what is wrong we are
always conscious. Whoever works with symbols only, is a pedant, a hypocrite, or a bungler. There are many such,
and they like to be together. Their babbling detains the scholar: their obstinate mediocrity vexes even the best.
The instruction which the true artist gives us, opens the mind; for where words fail him, deeds speak. The true
scholar learns from the known to unfold the unknown, and approaches more and more to being a master.
"Enough!" cried the Abbé; "the rest in due time. Now, look round you among these cases."
Wilhelm went, and read the titles of the rolls. With astonishment, he found Lothario's Apprenticeship, Jarno's
Apprenticeship, and his own Apprenticeship placed there, with many others whose names he did not know.
Chapter IX

"May I hope to cast a look into these rolls?"
"In this chamber there is now nothing hid from you."
"May I put a question?"
"Without scruple; and you may expect a positive reply, if it concerns a matter which is nearest your heart, and
ought to be so."
"Good then! Ye marvellous sages, whose sight has pierced so many secrets, can you tell me whether Felix is in
truth my son?"
"Hail to you for this question!" cried the Abbé, clapping hands for joy. "Felix is your son! By the holiest that lies
hid among us, I swear to you, Felix is your son; nor, in our opinion, was the mother that is gone unworthy of you.
Receive the lovely child from our hands; turn round, and venture to be happy."
Wilhelm heard a noise behind him: he turned round, and saw a child's face peeping archly through the tapestry at
the end of the room; it was Felix. The boy playfully hid himself, so soon as he was noticed. "Come forward!"
cried the Abbé; he came running; his father rushed towards him, took him in his arms, and pressed him to his
heart. "Yes! I feel it," cried he, "thou art mine! What a gift of Heaven have I to thank my friends for! Whence, or
how, comest thou, my child, at this important moment?"
"Ask not," said the Abbé. "Hail to thee, young man! Thy Apprenticeship is done; Nature has pronounced thee
free."

Book VIII
Chapter I
FELIX skipped into the garden; Wilhelm followed him with rapture: a lovely morning was displaying everything
with fresh charms; our friend enjoyed the most delightful moment. Felix was new in the free and lordly world; nor
did his father know much more than he about the objects, concerning which the little creature was repeatedly and
unweariedly inquiring. At last they joined the gardener, who had to tell them the names and uses of a multitude of
plants. Wilhelm looked on Nature as with unscaled eyes; the child's new−fangled curiosity first made him
sensible how weak an interest he himself had taken in external things, how small his actual knowledge was. Not
till this day, the happiest of his life, did his own cultivation seem to have commenced: he felt the necessity of
learning, being called upon to teach.
Jarno and the Abbé did not show themselves again till evening, when they brought a guest along with them.
Wilhelm viewed the stranger with amazement; he could scarce believe his eyes: it was Werner; who, likewise, for
a moment hesitated in his recognition. They embraced each other tenderly; neither of them could conceal that he
thought the other greatly altered. Werner declared that his friend was taller, stronger, straighter; that he had
become more polished in his looks and carriage. "Something of his old true−heartedness, I miss, however," added
he. "That too will soon appear again," said Wilhelm, "when we have recovered from our first astonishment."
The impression Werner made upon his friend was by no means so favourable. The honest man seemed rather to
have retrograded than advanced. He was much leaner than of old; his peaked face appeared to have grown
sharper, his nose longer; brow and crown had lost their hair; the voice, clear, eager, shrill, the hollow breast and
stooping shoulders, the sallow cheeks, announced indubitably that a melancholic drudge was there.

Wilhelm was discreet enough to speak but sparingly of these great changes; while the other, on the contrary, gave
free course to his friendly joy. "In truth," cried he, "if thou hast spent thy time badly, and, as I suppose, gained
nothing, it must be owned thou art grown a piece of manhood such as cannot fail to turn to somewhat. Do not
waste and squander me this too again; with such a figure thou shalt buy some rich and beautiful heiress." "I see,"
said Wilhelm, smiling, "thou wilt not belie thy character. Scarcely hast thou found thy brother after long absence,
when thou lookest on him as a piece of goods, a thing to speculate on, and make profit by."
Jarno and the Abbé did not seem at all astonished at this recognition; they allowed the two to expatiate on the past
and present as they pleased. Werner walked round and round his friend; turned him to this side and to that; so as
almost to embarrass him. "No!" cried he, "such a thing as this I never met with, and yet I know that I am not
mistaken. Thy eyes are deeper, thy brow is broader; thy nose has grown finer, thy mouth more lovely. Do but look
at him, how he stands; how it all suits and fits together! Well, idling is the way to grow. But for me, poor devil,"
said he, looking at himself in the glass, "if I had not all this while been making store of money, it were over with
me altogether."
Werner had got Wilhelm's last letter; the distant trading house, in common with which Lothario meant to purchase
the estates, was theirs. On that business Werner had come hither, not dreaming that he should meet with Wilhelm
on the way. The Baron's lawyer came; the papers were produced; Werner reckoned the conditions reasonable. "If
you mean well," said he, "as you seem to do, with this young man, you will of yourselves take care that our part
be not abridged: it shall be at my friend's option whether he will take the land, and lay out a portion of his fortune
on it." Jarno and the Abbé protested that they did not need this admonition. Scarcely had the business been
discussed in general terms, when Werner signified a longing for a game at ombre; to which, in consequence, Jarno
and the Abbé set themselves along with him. He was now grown so accustomed to it, that he could not pass the
evening without cards.
The two friends, after supper, being left alone, began to talk, and question one another very keenly, touching
everything they wished to have communicated. Wilhelm spoke in high terms of his situation, of his happiness in
being received among such men. Werner shook his head and said: "Well, I see, we should believe nothing that we
do not see with our eyes. More than one obliging friend assured me thou wert living with a wild young nobleman,
wert supplying him with actresses, helping him to waste his money; that, by thy means, he had quarrelled with
every one of his relations." "For my own sake, and the sake of these worthy gentlemen, I should be vexed at this,"
said Wilhelm, "had not my theatrical experience made me tolerant to every sort of calumny. How can men judge
rightly of our actions, which appear but singly or in fragments to them; of which they see the smallest portion;
while good and bad takes place in secret, and for most part nothing comes to light but an indifferent show? Are
not the actors and actresses in a play set up on boards before them; lamps are lit on every side; the whole
transaction is comprised within three hours; yet scarcely one of them knows rightly what to make of it."
Our friend proceeded to inquire about his family, his young comrades, his native town. Werner told, with great
haste, of changes that had taken place, of changes that were still in progress. "The women in our house," said he,
"are satisfied and happy; we are never short of money. One half of their time they spend in dressing; the other in
showing themselves when dressed. They are as domestic as a reasonable man could wish. My boys are growing
up to prudent youths. I already, as in vision, see them sitting, writing, reckoning, running, trading, trucking: each
of them, as soon as possible, shall have a business of his own. As to what concerns our fortune, thou wilt be
contented with the state of it. When we have got these lands in order, thou must come directly home with me; for
it now appears as if thou too couldst mingle with some skill in worldly undertakings. Thanks to thy new friends,
who have set thee on the proper path. I am certainly a fool: I never knew till now how well I liked thee, now when
I cannot gape and gaze at thee enough, so well and handsome thou lookest. That is in truth another form than the
portrait which was sent thy sister; which occasioned such disputes at home. Both mother and daughter thought
young master very handsome indeed, with his slack collar, half−open breast, large ruff, sleek pendent hair, round
hat, short waistcoat, and wide pantaloons; while I, on the other hand, maintained that the costume was scarce two
finger−breadths from that of Harlequin. But now thou lookest like a man; only the queue is wanting, in which I

beg of thee to bind thy hair; else some time or other, they will seize thee as a Jew, and demand toll and tribute of
thee."
Felix in the mean time had come into the room; and as they did not mind him, he had laid himself upon the sofa,
and was fallen asleep. "What urchin is this?" said Werner. Wilhelm at that moment had not the heart to tell the
truth; nor did he wish to lay a still ambiguous narrative before a man, who was by nature anything but credulous.
The whole party now proceeded to the lands, to view them, and conclude the bargain. Wilhelm would not part
with Felix from his side; for the boy's sake, he rejoiced exceedingly in the intended purchase. The longing of the
child for cherries and berries, the season for which was at hand, brought to his mind the days of his own youth,
and the manifold duties of a father, to prepare, to procure, and to maintain for his family a constant series of
enjoyments. With what interest he viewed the nurseries and the buildings! How zealously be contemplated
repairing what had been neglected, restoring what had fallen! He no longer looked upon the world with the eyes
of a bird of passage: an edifice he did not now consider as a grove that is hastily put together, and that withers ere
one leaves it. Everything that he proposed commencing was to be completed for his boy; everything that he
erected was to last for several generations. In this sense, his apprenticeship was ended: with the feeling of a father,
he had acquired all the virtues of a citizen. He felt this, and nothing could exceed his joy. "O needless strictness of
morality," exclaimed he, "while Nature in her own kindly manner trains us to all that we require to be! O strange
demands of civil society, which first perplexes and misleads us, then asks of us more than Nature herself! Woe to
every sort of culture which destroys the most effectual means of all true culture, and directs us to the end, instead
of rendering us happy on the way!"
Much as he had already seen in his life, it seemed as if the observation of the child afforded him his first clear
view of human nature. The theatre, the world had appeared before him, only as a multitude of thrown dice, every
one of which upon its upper surface indicates a greater or a smaller value; and which, when reckoned up together,
make a sum. But here in the person of the boy, as we might say, a single die was laid before him, on the many
sides of which the worth and worthlessness of man's nature were legibly engraved.
The child's desire to have distinctions made in his ideas grew stronger every day. Having learned that things had
names, he wished to hear the name of everything: supposing that there could be nothing which his father did not
know, he often teased him with his questions, and caused him to inquire concerning objects, which but for this he
would have passed without notice. Our innate tendency to pry into the origin and end of things was likewise soon
developed in the boy. When he asked whence came the wind, and whither went the flame, his father for the first
time truly felt the limitation of his own powers; and wished to understand how far man may venture with his
thoughts, and what things he may hope ever to give account of to himself or others. The anger of the child, when
he saw injustice done to any living thing, was extremely grateful to the father, as the symptom of a generous
heart. Felix once struck fiercely at the cook for cutting up some pigeons. The fine impression this produced on
Wilhelm was, indeed, ere long disturbed, when he found the boy unmercifully tearing sparrows in pieces, and
beating frogs to death. This trait reminded him of many men, who appear so scrupulously just when without
passion, and witnessing the proceedings of other men.
The pleasant feeling, that the boy was producing so fine and wholesome an influence on his being, was in short
time troubled for a moment, when our friend observed that in truth the boy was educating him more than he the
boy. The child's conduct he was not qualified to correct: its mind he could not guide in any path but a spontaneous
one. The evil habits which Aurelia had so violently striven against, had all, as it seemed, on her death, assumed
their ancient privileges. Felix still never shut the door behind him, he still would not eat from a plate; and no
greater pleasure could befall him than when he happened to be overlooked, and could take his bit immediately
from the dish, or let the full glass stand, and drink out of the bottle. He delighted also very much when he could
set himself in a corner with a book, and say with a serious air: "I must study this scholar stuff!" though he neither
knew his letters nor would learn them.

Book VIII

241

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Thus, when Wilhelm thought how little he had done for Felix, how little he was capable of doing, there arose at
times a restlessness within him, which appeared to counterbalance all his happiness. "Are we men, then," said he,
"so selfishly formed that we cannot possibly take proper charge of any one without us? Am I not acting with the
boy exactly as I did with Mignon? I drew the dear child towards me; her presence gave me pleasure; yet I cruelly
neglected her. What did I do for her education, which she longed for with such earnestness? Nothing! I left her to
herself, and to all the accidents to which in a society of coarse people she could be exposed. And now for this boy,
who seemed so interesting before he could be precious to thee, has thy heart ever bid thee do the smallest service
to him? It is time that thou shouldst cease to waste thy own years and those of others: awake, and think what thou
shouldst do for thyself, and for this good being, whom love and nature have so firmly bound to thee."
This soliloquy was but an introduction to admit that he had already thought, and cared, and tried, and chosen: he
could delay no longer to confess it. After sorrow, often and in vain repeated, for the loss of Mariana, he distinctly
felt that he must seek a mother for the boy; and also that he could not find one equal to Theresa. With this gifted
lady he was thoroughly acquainted. Such a spouse and helpmate seemed the only one to trust oneself to, in such
circumstances. Her generous affection for Lothario did not make him hesitate. By a singular destiny, they two had
been forever parted; Theresa looked upon herself as free; she had talked of marrying, with indifference indeed,
but as of a matter understood.
After long deliberation, he determined on communicating to her everything he knew about himself. She was to be
made acquainted with him, as he already was with her. He accordingly began to take a survey of his history: but it
seemed to him so empty of events, and in general so little to his credit, that he more than once was on the point of
giving up his purpose. At last, however, he resolved on asking Jarno for the Roll of his Apprenticeship, which he
had noticed lying in the Tower: Jarno said it was the very time for that, and Wilhelm consequently got it.
It is a feeling of awe and fear, which seizes on a man of noble mind, when conscious that his character is just
about to be exhibited before him. Every transition is a crisis; and a crisis presupposes sickness. With what
reluctance do we look into the glass after rising from a sick−bed! The recovery we feel: the effects of the past
disease are all we see. Wilhelm had, however, been sufficiently prepared; events had already spoken loudly to
him, and his friends had not spared him. If he opened the roll of parchment with some hurry, he grew calmer and
calmer the farther he read. He found his life delineated with large sharp strokes; neither unconnected incidents,
nor narrow sentiments perplexed his view; the most bland and general reflections taught without shaming him.
For the first time, his own figure was presented to him; not indeed, as in a mirror, a second self; but as in a
portrait, another self; we do not, it is true, recognise ourselves in every feature; but we are delighted that a
thinking spirit has so understood us, that such gifts have been employed in representing us, that an image of what
we were exists, and may endure when we ourselves are gone.
Wilhelm next employed himself in setting forth the history of his life, for the perusal of Theresa; all the
circumstances of it were recalled to memory by what he had been reading; he almost felt ashamed that, to her
great virtues, he had nothing to oppose which indicated a judicious activity. He had been minute in his written
narrative; he was brief in the letter which he sent along with it. He solicited her friendship, her love, if it were
possible; he offered her his hand, and entreated for a quick decision.
After some internal contest whether it was proper to impart this weighty business to his friends, to Jarno and the
Abbé, he determined not to do so. His resolution was so firm, the business was of such importance, that he could
not have submitted it to the decision of the wisest and best of men. He was even cautious enough to carry his
letter with his own hand to the nearest post. From his parchment roll it appeared with certainty enough that, in
very many actions of his life, in which he had conceived himself to be proceeding freely and in secret, he had
been observed, nay guided; and perhaps the thought of this had given him an unpleasant feeling; and he wished at
least in speaking to Theresa's heart, to speak purely from the heart; to owe his fate to her decision and
determination only. Hence in this solemn point he scrupled not to give his overseers the slip.

Chapter II
SCARCELY was the letter gone, when Lothario returned, Every one was gladdened at the prospect of so speedily
concluding the important business which they had in hand: Wilhelm waited with anxiety to see how all these
many threads were to be loosed, or tied anew, and how his own future state was to be settled. Lothario gave a
kindly salutation to them all: he was quite recovered and serene; he had the air of one who knows what he should
do, and who finds no hindrance in the way of doing it.
His cordial greeting Wilhelm could scarcely repay. "This," he had to own within himself, "is the friend, the lover,
bridegroom of Theresa; in his stead thou art presuming to intrude. Dost thou think it possible for thee to banish, to
obliterate an impression such as this?" Had the letter not been sent away, perhaps he would not have ventured
sending it at all. But happily the die was cast: it might be, Theresa had already taken up her resolution, and only
distance shrouded with its veil a happy termination. The winning or the losing must soon be decided. By such
considerations, he endeavoured to compose himself; and yet the movements of his heart were almost feverish. He
could give but little attention to the weighty business, on which in some degree the fate of his whole property
depended. In passionate moments, how trivial do we reckon all that is about us, all that belongs to us!
Happily for him, Lothario treated the affair with magnanimity, and Werner with an air of ease. The latter, in his
violent desire of gain, experienced a lively pleasure in contemplating the fine estate which was to be his friend's.
Lothario, for his part, seemed to be revolving very different thoughts. "I cannot take such pleasure in the
acquirement of property," said he, "as in the justness of it."
"And, in the name of Heaven," cried Werner, "is not this of ours acquired justly?"
"Not altogether," said Lothario.
"Are we not giving hard cash for it?"
"Doubtless," replied Lothario; "and most probably you will consider what I am now hinting at as nothing but a
whim. No property appears to me quite just, quite free of flaw, except it contribute to the state its due proportion."
"How!" said Werner: "You would rather that our lands, which we have purchased free from burden, had been
taxable?"
"Yes," replied Lothario, "in a suitable degree. It is only by this equality with every other kind of property, that our
possession of it can be made secure. In these new times, when so many old ideas are tottering, what is the grand
reason why the peasant reckons the possession of the noble less equitable than his own? Simply that the noble is
not burdened, and lies a burden on him."
"But how would the interest of our capital agree with that?" said Werner.
"Perfectly well," returned the other: "if the state, for a regular and fair contribution, would relieve us from the
feudal hocus−pocus; would allow us to proceed with our lands according to our pleasure: so that we were not
compelled to retain such masses of them undivided, so that we might part them more equally among our children,
whom we might thus introduce to vigorous and free activity; instead of leaving them the poor inheritance of these
our limited and limiting privileges, to enjoy which we must ever be invoking the ghosts of our forefathers. How
much happier were men and women in our rank of life, if they might with unforbidden eyes look round them, and
elevate by their selection, here a worthy maiden, there a worthy youth, regarding nothing farther than their own
ideas of happiness in marriage! The state would have more, perhaps better citizens, and would not so often be
distressed for want of heads and hands."
Chapter II

243

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
"I can assure you honestly," said Werner, "I never in my life thought about the state: my taxes, tolls and tributes I
have paid because it was the custom."
"Still, however," said Lothario, "I hope to make a worthy patriot of you. As he alone is a good father, who at table
serves his children first, so is he alone a good citizen, who, before all other outlays, discharges what he owes the
state."
By such general reflections their special business was accelerated rather than retarded. It was nearly over, when
Lothario said to Wilhelm: "I must send you to a place where you are needed more than here. My sister bids me
beg of you to go to her as soon as possible. Poor Mignon seems to be decaying more and more: and it is thought
your presence might allay the malady. Besides telling me in person, my sister has dispatched this note after me: so
that you perceive she reckons it a pressing case." Lothario handed him a billet. Wilhelm, who had listened in
extreme perplexity, at once discovered in these hasty pencil−strokes the hand of the Countess, and knew not what
to answer.
"Take Felix with you," said Lothario: "the little ones will cheer each other. You must be upon the road tomorrow
morning early: my sister's coach, in which my people travelled hither, is still here: I will give you horses half the
way; the rest you post. A prosperous journey to you! Make many compliments from me, when you arrive; tell my
sister I shall soon be back, and that she must prepare for guests. Our granduncle's friend, the Marchese Cipriani, is
on his way to visit us: he hoped to find the old man still in life; they meant to entertain each other with their
common love of art, and the recollection of their early intimacy. The Marchese, much younger than my uncle,
owed to him the greater part of his accomplishments. We must exert all our endeavours to fill up in some measure
the void which is awaiting him; and a larger party is the readiest means."
Lothario went with the Abbé to his chamber; Jarno had ridden off before; Wilhelm hastened to his room. There
was none to whom he could unbosom his distress; none by whose assistance he could turn aside the project,
which he viewed with so much fear. The little servant came, requesting him to pack: they were to put the luggage
on tonight, meaning to set out by daybreak. Wilhelm knew not what to do; at length he cried: "Well, I shall leave
this house at any rate; on the road I may consider what is to be done; at all events I will halt in the middle of my
journey; I can send a message hither, I can write what I recoil from saying; then let come of it what will." In spite
of this resolution, he spent a sleepless night: a look on Felix resting so serenely was the only thing that gave him
any solace. "O! who knows," cried he, "what trials are before me; who knows how sharply bygone errors will yet
punish me; how often good and reasonable projects for the future shall miscarry! But this treasure, which I call
my own, continue it to me, thou exorable or inexorable Fate! Were it possible that this best part of myself were
taken from me, that this heart could be torn from my heart, then farewell sense and understanding; farewell all
care and foresight; vanish thou tendency to perseverance! All that distinguishes us from the beasts, pass away!
And if it is not lawful for a man to end his heavy days by the act of his own hand, may speedy madness banish
consciousness, before Death, which destroys it forever, shall bring on his own long night."
He seized the boy in his arms, kissed him, clasped him and wetted him with plenteous tears.
The child awoke: his clear eye, his friendly look, touched his father to the inmost heart. "What a scene awaits
me," cried he, "when I shall present thee to the beautiful unhappy Countess, when she shall press thee to her
bosom, which thy father has so deeply injured! Ought I not to fear that she will push thee from her with a cry,
when the touch of thee renews her real or fancied pain!" The coachman did not leave him time for farther thought
or hesitation; but forced him into the carriage before day. Wilhelm wrapped his Felix well; the morning was cold
but clear; the child, for the first time in his life, saw the sun rise. His astonishment at the first fiery glance of the
luminary, at the growing power of the light; his pleasure and his strange remarks rejoiced the father, and afforded
him a glimpse into the heart of the boy, before which, as over a clear and silent sea, the sun was mounting and
hovering.

Chapter II

244

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
In a little town the coachman halted; unyoked his horses, and rode back. Wilhelm took possession of a room, and
asked himself seriously whether he would stay or proceed. Thus irresolute he ventured to take out the little note,
which hitherto he had never had the heart to look on: it contained the following words: "Send thy young friend
very soon; Mignon for the last two days has been growing rather worse. Sad as the occasion is, I shall be happy to
get acquainted with him."
The concluding words Wilhelm, at the first glance, had not seen. He was terrified on reading them, and instantly
determined not to go. "How?" cried he, "Lothario, knowing what occurred between us, has not told her who I am?
She is not, with a settled mind, expecting an acquaintance, whom she would rather not see: she expects a stranger;
and I enter! I see her shudder and start back, I see her blush! No, it is impossible for me to encounter such a
scene!" Just then his horses were led out and yoked: Wilhelm was determined to take off his luggage and remain.
He felt extremely agitated. Hearing the maid running up−stairs to tell him, as he thought, that all was ready, he
began on the spur of the instant to devise some pretext for continuing; his eyes were fixed, without attention, on
the letter which he still held in his hand. "In the name of Heaven!" cried he, "what is this? It is not the hand of the
Countess, it is the hand of the Amazon!"
The maid came in; requested him to walk down, and took Felix with her. "Is it possible," exclaimed he, "is it true?
What shall I do? Remain, and wait, and certify myself? Or hasten, hasten and rush into an explanation? Thou art
on the way to her, and thou canst loiter? This night thou mayest see her, and thou wilt voluntarily lock thyself in
prison? It is her hand; yes, it is hers! This hand calls thee; her coach is yoked to lead thee to her! Now the riddle is
explained: Lothario has two sisters; my relation to the one he knows; how much I owe to the other is unknown to
him. Nor is she aware that the wounded stroller, who stands indebted to her for his health, if not his life, has been
received with such unmerited attention in her brother's house."
Felix, who was swinging to and fro in the coach, cried up to him: "Father! Come, O come! Look at the pretty
clouds, the pretty colours!" "Yes, I come," cried Wilhelm, springing down−stairs; "and all the glories of the sky,
which thou, good creature, so admirest, are as nothing to the moment which I look for."
Sitting in the coach, he recalled all the circumstances of the matter to his memory. "So this is the Natalia, then,
Theresa's friend! What a discovery: what hopes, what prospects! How strange that the fear of speaking about the
one sister should have altogether concealed from me the existence of the other!" With what joy he looked on
Felix! He anticipated for the child, as for himself, the best reception.
Evening at last came on; the sun had set; the road was not the best; the postillion drove slowly; Felix had fallen
asleep, and new cares and doubts arose in the bosom of our friend. "What delusion, what fantasies are these that
rule thee!" said he to himself: "An uncertain similarity of handwriting has at once assured thee, and given thee
matter for the strangest castles in the air." He again brought out the paper; in the departing light he again imagined
that he recognised the hand of the Countess: his eyes could no longer find in the parts what his heart had at once
shown him in the whole. "These horses, then, are running with thee to a scene of terror! Who knows but in a few
hours they may have to bring thee back again? And if thou shouldst meet with her alone! But perhaps her husband
will be there; perhaps the Baroness? How altered will she be! Shall I not fail, and sink to the earth, at sight of
her?"
Yet a faint hope that it might be his Amazon, would often gleam through these gloomy thoughts. It was now
night: the carriage rolled into a courtyard, and halted; a servant with a link stept out of stately portal, and came
down the broad steps to the carriage−door. "You have been long looked for," said he, opening it. Wilhelm
dismounted; took the sleeping Felix in his arms: the first servant called to a second, who was standing in the door
with a light: "Show the gentleman up to the Baroness."
Quick as lightning, it went through Wilhelm's soul: "What a happiness! Be it by accident or of purpose, the
Baroness is here! I shall see her first; apparently the Countess has retired to rest. Ye good spirits, grant that the
Chapter II

245

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
moment of deepest perplexity may pass tolerably over!"
He entered the house: he found himself in the most earnest, and, as he almost felt, the holiest place that he had
ever trod. A pendent dazzling lustre threw its light upon a broad and softly rising flight of stairs, which lay before
him, and which parted into two divisions at a turn above. Marble statues and busts were standing upon pedestals
and arranged in niches: some of them seemed known to him. The impressions of our childhood abide with us,
even in their minutest traces. He recognised a Muse, which had formerly belonged to his grandfather; not indeed
by its form or worth, but by an arm which had been restored, and some new−inserted pieces of the robe. He felt as
if a fairy tale had turned out to be true. The child was heavy in his arms; he lingered on the stairs, and knelt down,
as if to place him more conveniently. His real want, however, was to get a moment's breathing time. He could
scarcely raise himself again. The servant, who was carrying the light, offered to take Felix; but Wilhelm could not
part with him. He had now mounted to an antechamber; in which, to his still greater astonishment, he observed
the well−known picture of the sick king's son hanging on the wall. He had scarcely time to cast a look on it; the
servant hurried him along through two rooms into a cabinet. Here, behind a light−screen, which threw a shadow
on her, sat a young lady reading. "O that it were she!" said he within himself at this decisive moment. He set
down the boy, who seemed to be awakening; he meant to approach the lady; but the child sank together drunk
with sleep; the lady rose, and came to him. It was the Amazon! Unable to restrain himself, he fell upon his knee,
and cried: "It is she!" He seized her hand, and kissed it with unbounded rapture. The child was lying on the carpet
between them, sleeping softly.
Felix was carried to the sofa: Natalia sat down beside him; she directed Wilhelm to the chair which was standing
nearest them. She proposed to order some refreshments; these our friend declined; he was altogether occupied
convincing himself that it was she, closely examining her features, shaded by the screen, and accurately
recognizing them. She told him of Mignon's sickness, in general terms; that the poor child was gradually
consuming under the influence of a few deep feelings; that, with her extreme excitability, and her endeavouring to
hide it, her little heart often suffered violent and dangerous pains; that any unexpected agitation of her mind, this
primary organ of life would suddenly stop, and no trace of the vital movement could be felt in the good child's
bosom. That when such an agonising cramp was past, the force of nature would again express itself in strong
pulses, and now torment the child by its excess, as she had before suffered by its defect.
Wilhelm recollected one spasmodic scene of that description, and Natalia referred him to the doctor, who would
speak with him at large on the affair, and explain more circumstantially why he, the friend and benefactor of the
child, had been at present sent for. "One curious change," Natalia added, "You will find in her: she now wears
women's clothes, to which she had once such an aversion."
"How did you succeed in this?" said Wilhelm.
"If it was indeed a thing to be desired," said she, "We owe it all to chance. Hear how it happened. Perhaps you are
aware that I have constantly about me a number of little girls, whose opening minds I endeavour, as they grow in
strength, to train to what is good and right. From my mouth they learn nothing but what I myself regard as true:
yet I cannot and would not hinder them from gathering, among other people, many fragments of the common
prejudices and errors which are current in the world. If they inquire of me about them, I attempt, as far as
possible, to join these alien and intrusive notions to some just one, and thus to render them, if not useful, at least
harmless. Some time ago, my girls had heard among the peasants' children many tales of angels, of Knecht Rupert
and such shadowy characters, who, they understood, appeared at certain times in person, to give presents to good
children, and to punish naughty ones. They had an idea that these strange visitants were people in disguise: in this
I confirmed them; and without entering into explanations, I determined on the first opportunity, to let them see a
spectacle of that sort. It chanced that the birthday of two twin−sisters, whose behaviour had been always very
good, was near; I promised that, on this occasion, the little present they had so well deserved should be delivered
to them by an angel. They were on the stretch of curiosity regarding this phenomenon. I had chosen Mignon for
the part; and accordingly, at the appointed day, I had her suitably equipt in a long light snow white dress. She was,
Chapter II

246

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
of course, provided with a golden girdle round her waist, and a golden fillet on her hair. I at first proposed to omit
the wings; but the young ladies who were decking her, insisted on a pair of large golden pinions, in preparing
which they meant to show their highest art. Thus did the strange apparition, with a lily in the one hand, and a little
basket in the other, glide in among the girls: she surprised even me. 'There comes the angel!' said I. The children
all shrank back; at last they cried: 'It is Mignon!' yet they durst not venture to approach the wondrous figure.
'Here are your gifts,' said she, putting down the basket. They gathered around her, they viewed, they felt, they
questioned her.
'Art thou an angel?' asked one of them.
'I wish I were,' said Mignon.
'Why dost thou bear a lily?'
'So pure and so open should my heart be; then were I happy.'
'What wings are these? Let us see them!'
'They represent far finer ones, which are not yet unfolded.'
"And thus significantly did she answer all their other child like, innocent inquiries. The little party having
satisfied their curiosity, and the impression of the show beginning to abate, we were for proceeding to undress the
little angel. This, however, she resisted: she took her cithern; she seated herself here, on this high writing−table,
and sang a little song with touching grace:Such let me seem till such I be; Take not my snow−white dress
away!Soon from this dusk of earth I flee Up to the glittering lands of day. There first a little space I rest, Then
wake so glad, to scene so kind;In earthly robes no longer drest, This band, this girdle left behind. And those calm
shining sons of morn They ask not who is maid or boy;No robes, no garments there are worn, Our body pure from
sin's alloy.Through little life not much I toil'd, Yet anguish long this heart has wrung,Untimely woe my blossom
spoil'd; Make me again forever young!
"I immediately determined upon leaving her the dress," proceeded Natalia; "and procuring her some others of a
similar kind. These she now wears; and in them, I think, her form has quite a different expression."
As it was already late, Natalia let the stranger go: he parted from her not without anxiety. "Is she married or not?"
asked he within himself. He had been afraid, at every rustling, that the door would open, and her husband enter.
The serving−man, who showed him to his room, went off, before our friend had mustered resolution to inquire
regarding this. His unrest held him long awake; he kept comparing the figure of the Amazon with the figure of his
new acquaintance. The two would not combine: the former he had, as it were, himself fashioned; the latter seemed
as if it would almost new−fashion him.

Chapter III
NEXT morning, while all was yet quiet, he went about viewing the house. It was the purest, finest, stateliest piece
of architecture he had ever seen. "True art," cried he, "is like good company: it constrains us in the most delightful
way to recognise the measure by which, and up to which, our inward nature has been shaped by culture." The
impression which the busts and statues of his grandfather made upon him was exceedingly agreeable. With a
longing mind, he hastened to the picture of the sick king's son; and he still felt it to be charming and affecting.
The servant opened to him various other chambers: he found a library, a museum, a cabinet of philosophical
instruments. In much of this he could not help perceiving his extreme ignorance. Meanwhile Felix had awakened,
and come running after him. The thought of how and when he might receive Theresa's letter gave him pain; he
dreaded seeing Mignon, and in some degree Natalia. How unlike his present state was his state at the moment
when he sealed the letter to Theresa, and with a glad heart wholly gave himself to that noble being!

Chapter III

247

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Natalia sent for him to breakfast. He proceeded to a room, where several tidy little girls, all apparently below ten
years, were occupied in furnishing a table, while another of the same appearance brought in various sorts of
beverage.
Wilhelm cast his eye upon a picture, hung above the sofa; he could not but recognise in it the portrait of Natalia,
little as the execution satisfied him. Natalia entered, and the likeness seemed entirely to vanish. To his comfort, it
was painted with the cross of a religious order on its breast; and he now saw another such upon Natalia's.
"I have just been looking at the portrait here," said he; "and it seems surprising that a painter could have been at
once so true and so false. The picture resembles you in general extremely well, and yet it neither has your features
nor your character."
"It is rather matter of surprise," replied Natalia, "that the likeness is so good. It is not my picture; but the picture of
an aunt, whom I resembled even in childhood, though she was then advanced in years. It was painted when her
age was just about what mine is: at the first glance every one imagines it is meant for me. You should have been
acquainted with that excellent lady. I owe her much. A very weak state of health, perhaps too much employment
with her own thoughts, and withal a moral and religious scrupulosity, prevented her from being to the world what,
in other circumstances, she might have become. She was a light that shone but on a few friends, and on me
especially."
"Can it be possible," said Wilhelm, after thinking for a moment, while so many circumstances seemed to
correspond so well, "can it be possible that the fair and noble Saint, whose meek Confessions I had liberty to
study, was your aunt?"
"You read the manuscript?" inquired Natalia.
"Yes," said Wilhelm, "with the greatest sympathy, and not without effect upon my life. What most impressed me
in this paper was, if I may term it so, the purity of being, not only of the writer herself, but of all that lay round
her; that self−dependence of nature, that impossibility of admitting anything into her soul which would not
harmonise with its own noble lovely tone."
"You are more tolerant to this fine spirit," said Natalia, "nay I will say more just, than many other men, to whom
the narrative has been imparted. Every cultivated person knows how he has had to strive against a certain
rudeness both in himself and others; how much his culture costs him; how apt he is, after all, in certain cases, to
recollect himself alone, forgetting what he owes to others. How often has a worthy person to reproach himself for
having failed to act with proper delicacy! And when a fair nature too delicately, too conscientiously cultivates,
nay, if you will, overcultivates itself, there seems to be no toleration, no indulgence for it in the world. Yet such
persons are, without us, what the ideal of perfection is within us: models not for being imitated, but for being
aimed at. We laugh at the cleanliness of the Dutch: but would our friend Theresa be what she is, if some such
notion were not always present to her in her housekeeping?"
"I see before me then," cried Wilhelm, "in Theresa's friend, the same Natalia whom her amiable relative was so
attached to; the Natalia, who from her youth was so affectionate, so sympathising and helpful! It was only out of
such a line that such a being could proceed. What a prospect opens before me, while I at once survey your
ancestors, and all the circle you belong to!"
"Yes," replied Natalia, "in a certain sense, the story of my aunt would give you the faithfulest picture of us. Her
love to me, indeed, has made her praise the little girl too much: in speaking of a child, we never speak of what is
present, but of what we hope for."

Chapter III

248

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Wilhelm, in the mean time, was rapidly reflecting that Lothario's parentage and early youth were now likewise
known to him. The fair Countess, too, appeared before him in her childhood, with the aunt's pearls about her neck:
he himself had been near those pearls, when her soft lovely lips bent down to meet his own. These beautiful
remembrances he sought to drive away by other thoughts. He ran through the characters to whom that manuscript
had introduced him. "I am here then," cried he, "in your worthy uncle's house! It is no house, it is a temple, and
you are the priestess, nay the Genius of it: I shall recollect for life my impression yesternight, when I entered, and
the old figures of my earliest days were again before me. I thought of the compassionate marble statues in
Mignon's song: but these figures had not to lament about me; they looked upon me with a lofty earnestness, they
brought my first years into immediate contact with the present moment. That ancient treasure of our family, the
joy of my grandfather, I find here placed among so many other noble works of art; and myself, whom nature
made the darling of the good old man, my unworthy self I find here also, Heavens! in what society, in what
connexions!"
The girls had by degrees gone out to mind their little occupations. Natalia, left alone with Wilhelm, asked some
farther explanation of his last remark. The discovery, that a number of her finest paintings and statues had at one
time been the property of Wilhelm's grandfather, did not fail to give a cheerful stimulus to their discourse. As by
that manuscript he had got acquainted with Natalia's house, so now he found himself too, as it were, in his
inheritance. At length he asked for Mignon. His friend desired him to have patience till the Doctor, who had been
called out into the neighbourhood, returned. It is easy to suppose that the Doctor was the same little active man,
whom we already know, and who was spoken of in the Confessions of a Fair Saint.
"Since I am now," said Wilhelm, "in the middle of your family circle, I presume the Abbé, whom that paper
mentions, is the strange inexplicable person, whom, after the most singular series of events, I met with in your
brother's house? Perhaps you can give some more accurate conception of him?"
"Of the Abbé there might much be said," replied Natalia: "what I know best about him is the influence which he
exerted on our education. He was, for a time at least, convinced that education ought in every case to be adapted
to the inclinations: his present views of it I know not. He maintained that with man the first and last consideration
was activity, and that we could not act on anything, without the proper gifts for it, without an instinct impelling us
to it. 'You admit,' he used to say, "that poets must be born such; you admit this with regard to all professors of the
fine arts; because you must admit it, because those workings of human nature cannot very plausibly be aped. But
if we consider well, we shall find that every capability, however slight, is born with us: that there is no vague
general capability in men. It is our ambiguous dissipating education that makes men uncertain: it awakens wishes,
when it should be animating tendencies; instead of forwarding our real capacities, it turns our efforts towards
objects which are frequently discordant with the mind that aims at them. I augur better of a child, a youth who is
wandering astray on a path of his own, than of many who are walking aright upon paths which are not theirs. If
the former, either by themselves, or by the guidance of others, ever find the right path, that is to say, the path
which suits their nature, they will never leave it; while the latter are in danger every moment of shaking off a
foreign yoke, and abandoning themselves to unrestricted license."'
"It is strange," said Wilhelm, "that this same extraordinary man should likewise have taken charge of me; should,
as it seems, have, in his own fashion, if not led, at least confirmed me in my errors, for a time. How he will
answer to the change of having joined with others, as it were, to make game of me, I wait patiently to see."
"Of this whim, if it is one," said Natalia, "I have little reason to complain: of all the family I answered best with it.
Indeed I see not how Lothario could have got a finer breeding: but for my sister, the Countess, some other
treatment might have suited better; perhaps they should have studied to infuse more earnestness and strength into
her nature. As to brother Friedrich, what is to become of him cannot be conjectured: he will fall a sacrifice, I fear,
to this experiment in pedagogy."
"You have another brother, then?" cried Wilhelm.

Chapter III

249

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
"Yes," replied Natalia; "and a light merry youth he is; and as they have not hindered him from roaming up and
down the world, I know not what the wild dissipated boy will turn to. It is a great while since I saw him. The only
thing which calms my fears is, that the Abbé, and the whole society about my brother, are receiving constant
notice where he is and what he does."
Wilhelm was about to ask Natalia her opinion more precisely on the Abbé's paradoxes, as well as to solicit
information about that mysterious society; but the Physician entering changed their conversation. After the first
compliments of welcome, he began to speak of Mignon.
Natalia then took Felix by the hand, saying she would lead the child to Mignon, and prepare her for the entrance
of her friend.
The Doctor, now alone with Wilhelm, thus proceeded: "I have wondrous things to tell you; such as you are not
anticipating. Natalia has retired, that we might speak with greater liberty of certain matters, which, although I first
learned them by her means, her presence would prevent us from discussing freely. The strange temper of the child
seems to consist almost exclusively of deep longing; the desire of revisiting her native land, and the desire for
you, my friend, are, I might almost say, the only earthly things about her. Both these feelings do but grasp towards
an immeasurable distance, both objects lie before her unattainable. The neighbourhood of Milan seems to be her
home: in very early childhood she was kidnapped from her parents by a company of rope−dancers. A more
distinct account we cannot get from her, partly because she was then too young to recollect the names of men and
places; but especially because she has made an oath to tell no living mortal her abode and parentage. For the
strolling party, who came up with her when she had lost her way, and to whom she so accurately described her
dwelling, with such piercing entreaties to conduct her home, but carried her along with them the faster; and at
night in their quarters, when they thought the child was sleeping, joked about their precious capture, declaring she
would never find the way home again. On this, a horrid desperation fell upon the miserable creature; but at last
the Holy Virgin rose before her eyes, and promised that she would assist her. The child then swore within herself
a sacred oath, that she would henceforth trust no human creature, would disclose her history to no one, but live
and die in hope of immediate aid from Heaven. Even this, which I am telling you, Natalia did not learn expressly
from her; but gathered it from detached expressions, songs and childlike inadvertencies, betraying what they
meant to hide."
Wilhelm called to memory many a song and word of this dear child, which he could now explain. He earnestly
requested the Physician to keep from him none of the confessions or mysterious poetry of this peculiar being.
"Prepare yourself," said the Physician, "for a strange confession; for a story with which you, without remembering
it, have much to do; and which, as I greatly fear, has been decisive for the death and life of this good creature."
"Let me hear," said Wilhelm; "my impatience is unbounded."
"Do you recollect a secret nightly visit from a female," said the Doctor, "after your appearance in the character of
Hamlet?"
"Yes, I recollect it well," cried Wilhelm blushing, "but I did not look to be reminded of it at the present moment."
"Do you know who it was?"
"I do not! You frighten me! In the name of Heaven, not Mignon surely? Who was it? Tell me, pray."
"I know it not myself."
"Not Mignon, then?"
Chapter III

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
"No, certainly not Mignon: but Mignon was intending at the time to glide in to you: and saw, with horror, from a
corner where she lay concealed, a rival get before her."
"A rival!" cried our friend: "Speak on, you more and more confound me."
"Be thankful," said the Doctor, "that you can arrive at the result so soon through means of me. Natalia and I, with
but a distant interest in the matter, had distress enough to undergo, before we could thus far discover the
perplexed condition of the poor dear creature, whom we wished to help. By some wanton speeches of Philina and
the other girls, by a certain song which she had heard Philina sing, the child's attention had been roused; she
longed to pass a night beside the man she loved, without conceiving anything to be implied in this beyond a happy
and confiding rest. A love for you, my friend, was already keen and powerful in her little heart; in your arms, the
child had found repose from many a sorrow; she now desired this happiness in all its fulness. At one time she
proposed to ask you for it in a friendly manner; but a secret horror always held her back. At last, that night and the
excitement of abundant wine inspired her with the courage to attempt the adventure, and glide in to you on that
occasion. Accordingly she ran before, to hide herself in your apartment, which was standing open; but just when
she had reached the top of the stairs, having heard a rustling, she concealed herself, and saw a female in a white
dress slip into your chamber. You yourself arrived soon after, and she heard you push the large bolt.
"Mignon's agony was now unutterable: all the violent feelings of a passionate jealousy mingled themselves with
the unacknowledged longing of obscure desire, and seized her half−developed nature with tremendous force. Her
heart, which hitherto had beaten violently with eagerness and expectation, now at once began to falter and stop; it
pressed her bosom like a heap of lead; she could not draw her breath, she knew not what to do; she heard the
sound of the old man's harp, hastened to the garret where he was, and passed the night at his feet in horrible
convulsions."
The Physician paused a moment; then, as Wilhelm still kept silence, he proceeded: "Natalia told me, nothing in
her life had so alarmed and touched her as the state of Mignon while relating this: indeed, our noble friend
accused herself of cruelty in having, by her questions and management, drawn this confession from her, and
renewed by recollection the violent sorrows of the poor little girl.
"'The dear creature,' said Natalia, 'had scarcely come so far with her recital, or rather with her answers to my
questions, when she sank all at once before me on the ground and with her hand on her bosom piteously moaned
that the pain of that excruciating night was come back. She twisted herself like a worm upon the floor; and I had
to summon all my composure, that I might remember and apply such means of remedy for mind and body as were
known to me."'
"It is a painful predicament you put me in," cried Wilhelm, "by impressing me so vividly with the feeling of my
manifold injustice towards this unhappy and beloved being, at the very moment when I am again to meet her. If
she is to see me, why do you deprive me of the courage to appear with freedom? And shall I confess it to you?
Since her mind is so affected, I perceive not how my presence can be advantageous to her. If you, as a Physician,
are persuaded that this double longing has so undermined her being as to threaten death, why should I renew her
sorrows by my presence, and perhaps accelerate her end?"
"My friend," replied the Doctor, "where we cannot cure. it is our duty to alleviate; and how much the presence of
a loved object tends to take from the imagination its destructive power, how it changes an impetuous longing to a
peaceful looking, I could prove by the most convincing instances. Everything in measure and with purpose! For,
in other cases, this same presence may rekindle an affection nigh extinguished. But do you go and see the child;
behave to her with kindness, and let us wait the consequence."
Natalia, at this moment coming back, bade Wilhelm follow her to Mignon. "She appears to feel quite happy with
the boy," observed Natalia, "and I hope she will receive our friend with mildness." Wilhelm followed, not without
Chapter III

251

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
reluctance: he was deeply moved by what he had been hearing; he feared a stormy scene of passion. It was
altogether the reverse that happened on his entrance.
Mignon, dressed in long white women's clothes, with her brown copious hair partly knotted, partly clustering out
in locks, was sitting with the boy Felix on her lap, and pressing him against her heart. She looked like a departed
spirit, he like life itself: it seemed as if Heaven and Earth were clasping one another. She held out her hand to
Wilhelm with a smile, and said: "I thank thee for bringing back the child to me: they had taken him away, I know
not how, and since then I could not live. So long as my heart needs anything on earth, thy Felix shall fill up the
void."
The quietness, which Mignon had displayed on meeting with her friend, produced no little satisfaction in the
party. The Doctor signified that Wilhelm should go frequently and see her; that in body as in mind she should be
kept as equable as possible. He himself departed, promising to return soon.
Wilhelm could now observe Natalia in her own circle: one would have desired nothing better than to live beside
her. Her presence had the purest influence on the girls, and young ladies of various ages, who resided with her in
the house, or came to pay her visits from the neighbourhood.
"The progress of your life," said Wilhelm once to her, "must always have been very even; your aunt's delineation
of you in your childhood seems, if I mistake not, still to fit. It is easy to see, that you never were entangled in your
path. You have never been compelled to retrograde."
"This I owe to my uncle and the Abbé," said Natalia, "who so well discriminated my prevailing turn of mind.
From my youth upwards, I can recollect no livelier feeling than that I was constantly observing people's wants,
and had an irresistible desire to make them up. The child that had not learned to stand on its feet, the old man that
could no longer stand on his; the longing of a rich family for children, the inability of a poor one to maintain their
children; each silent wish for some particular species of employment, the impulse towards any talent, the natural
gifts for many little necessary arts of life, were sure to strike me: my eye seemed formed by nature for detecting
them. I saw such things, where no one had directed my attention; I seemed born for seeing them alone. The
charms of inanimate nature, to which so many persons are exceedingly susceptible, had no effect upon me; the
charms of art, if possible, had less. My most delightful occupation was and is, when a deficiency, a want appeared
before me anywhere, to set about devising a supply, a remedy, a help for it.
"If I saw a poor creature in rags, the superfluous clothes I had noticed hanging in the wardrobes of my friends
immediately occurred to me; if I saw children wasting for want of care, I was sure to recollect some lady I had
found oppressed with tedium amid riches and conveniences: if I saw too many persons crammed into a narrow
space, I thought they should be lodged in the spacious chambers of palaces and vacant houses. This mode of
viewing things was altogether natural, without the least reflection; so that in my childhood I often made the
strangest work of it, and more than once embarrassed people by my singular proposals. Another of my
peculiarities was this, I did not learn till late, and after many efforts, to consider money as a means of satisfying
wants: my benefits were all distributed in kind, and my simplicity, I know, was frequently the cause of laughter.
None but the Abbé seemed to understand me; he met me everywhere; he made me acquainted with myself, with
these wishes, these tendencies, and taught me how to satisfy them suitably."
"Do you then," said Wilhelm, "in the education of your little female world employ the method of these
extraordinary men? Do you too leave every mind to form itself? Do you too leave your girls to search and wander,
to pursue delusions, happily to reach the goal, or miserably lose themselves in error?"
"No!" replied Natalia: "such treatment as that would altogether contradict my notions. To my mind, he who does
not help us at the needful moment, never helps; he who does not counsel at the needful moment, never counsels. I
also reckon it essential that we lay down and continually impress on children certain laws, to operate as a kind of
Chapter III

252

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
hold in life. Nay, I could almost venture to assert that it is better to be wrong by rule, than to be wrong with
nothing but the fitful caprices of our disposition to impel us hither and thither: and in my way of viewing men,
there always seems to be a void in their nature, which cannot be filled up, except by some decisive and distinctly
settled law."
"Your manner of proceeding then," said Wilhelm, "is entirely different from the manner of our friends?"
"Yes," replied Natalia: "and you may see the unexampled tolerance of these men, from the fact, that they nowise
disturb me in my practice; but leave me on my own path, simply because it is my own, and even assist me in
everything that I require of them."
A more minute description of Natalia's plans in managing her children we reserve for some other opportunity.
Mignon often asked to be of their society; and this they granted her with greater readiness, as she appeared to be
again accustoming herself to Wilhelm, to be opening her heart to him, and in general to have become more
cheerful and contented with existence. In walking, being easily fatigued, she liked to hang upon his arm.
"Mignon," she would say, "now climbs and bounds no more; yet she still longs to mount the summit of the hills,
to skip from house to house, from tree to tree. How enviable are the birds; and then so prettily and socially they
build their nests too!"
Ere long it became habitual for her to invite her friend, more than once every day, into the garden. When Wilhelm
was engaged or absent, Felix had to take his place; and if poor Mignon seemed at times quite loosened from the
earth, there were other moments when she would again hold fast to father and son, and seem to dread a separation
from them more than anything beside.
Natalia wore a thoughtful look. "We meant," said she, "to open her tender little heart, by sending for you hither. I
know not whether we did prudently." She stopped, and seemed expecting Wilhelm to say something. To him also
it occurred that by his marriage with Teresa, Mignon, in the present circumstances, would be fearfully offended:
but in his uncertainty he did not venture mentioning his project; he had no suspicion that Natalia knew of it.
As little could he talk with freedom, when his noble friend began to speak about her sister; to praise her good
qualities, and to lament her hapless situation. He felt exceedingly embarrassed when Natalia told him he would
shortly see the Countess here. "Her husband," said she, "has now no object but replacing Zinzendorf in the
Community; and by insight and activity supporting and extending that establishment. He is coming with his wife,
to take a sort of leave; he then purposes visiting the various spots where the Community have settled. They appear
to treat him as he wishes: and I should not wonder if, in order to be altogether like his predecessor, he ventured,
with my sister, on a voyage to America; for being already well−nigh convinced that a little more would make a
saint of him, the wish to superadd the dignity of martyrdom has probably enough often flitted through his mind."

Chapter IV
THEY had often spoken of Theresa, often mentioned her in passing; and Wilhelm almost every time was minded
to confess that he had offered her his heart and hand. A certain feeling, which he was not able to explain,
restrained him; he paused and wavered, till at length Natalia, with the heavenly modest cheerful smile she often
wore, said to him: "It seems, then, I at last must break silence, and force myself into your confidence! Why, my
friend, do you keep secret from me an affair of such importance to yourself, and so closely touching my concerns?
You have made my friend the offer of your hand: I do not mix uncalled in the transaction: here are my credentials;
here is the letter which she writes to you, which she sends you through my hands."
"A letter from Theresa!" cried he.
Chapter IV

253

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
"Yes, mein herr! Your destiny is settled; you are happy. Let me congratulate my friend and you on your good
fortune."
Wilhelm spoke not, but gazed out before him. Natalia looked at him; she saw that he was pale. "Your joy is
strong," continued she; "it takes the form of terror, it deprives you of the power to speak. My participation is not
the less cordial that I show it you in words. I hope you will be grateful: for I may say, my influence on the
decision of your bride has not been small: she asked me for advice; and as it happened, by a singular coincidence,
that you were here just then, I was enabled to destroy the few scruples she still entertained. Our messages went
swiftly to and fro: here is her determination; here is the conclusion of the treaty! And now you shall read her other
letters, you shall have a free clear look into the fair heart of your Theresa."
Wilhelm opened the letter which she handed him unsealed. It contained these friendly words:
"I am yours, as I am and as you know me. I call you mine, as you are and as I know you. What in ourselves, what
in our connexion wedlock changes, we shall study to adjust, by reason, cheerfulness and mutual goodwill. As it is
no passion, but trust and inclination for each other that is leading us together, we run less risk than thousands of
others. You will forgive me, will you not, if I still think often and kindly of my former friend; in return, I will
press your Felix to my heart, as if I were his mother. If you choose to share my little mansion straightway, we are
lord and master there, and in the mean while the purchase of your land might be concluded. I could wish that no
new arrangements were made in it without me. I could wish at once to prove that I deserve the confidence which
you repose in me. Adieu, dear, dear Friend! Beloved Bridegroom, honoured Husband! Theresa clasps you to her
breast with hope and joy. My friend will tell you more, will tell you all."
Wilhelm, to whose mind this sheet recalled the image of Theresa with the liveliest distinctness, had now
recovered his composure. While reading, thoughts had rapidly alternated within his soul. With terror, he
discovered in his heart the most vivid traces of an inclination to Natalia: he blamed himself, declaring every
thought of that description to be madness; he represented to himself Theresa in her whole perfection; he again
perused the letter, he grew cheerful, or rather he so far regained his self−possession that he could appear cheerful.
Natalia handed him the letters which had passed between Theresa and herself: out of Theresa's we propose
extracting one or two passages.
After delineating her bridegroom in her own peculiar way, Theresa thus proceeded: "Such is the notion I have
formed of the man who now offers me his hand. What he thinks of himself thou shalt see by and by, in the papers
he has sent me, where he altogether candidly draws his own portrait; I feel persuaded that I shall be happy with
him." "As to rank, thou knowest my ideas on this point long ago. Some people look on disagreement of external
circumstances as a fearful thing, and cannot remedy it. I wish not to persuade any one, I wish to act according to
my own persuasion. I mean not to set others an example, nor do I act without example. It is interior disagreements
only that frighten me: a frame that does not fit what it is meant to hold; much pomp and little real enjoyment;
wealth and avarice, nobility and rudeness, youth and pedantry, poverty and ceremonies,−these are the things
which would annihilate me, however it may please the world to stamp and rate them." "If I hope that we shall suit
each other, the hope is chiefly founded upon this, that he resembles thee, my dear Natalia, thee, whom I so highly
prize and reverence. Yes, he has thy noble searching and striving for the Better, whereby we of ourselves produce
the Good which we suppose we find. How often have I blamed thee, not in silence, for treating this or that person,
for acting in this or that case, otherwise than I should have done! and yet in general the issue showed that thou
wert right. 'When we take people,' thou wouldst say, 'merely as they are, we make them worse; when we treat
them as if they were what they should be, we improve them as far as they can be improved.' To see or to act thus,
I know full well is not for me. Skill, order, discipline, direction, that is my affair. I always recollect what Jarno
said: 'Theresa trains her pupils, Natalia forms them.' Nay once he went so far as to assert that of the three fair
qualities, faith, love and hope, I was entirely destitute. 'Instead of faith,' said he, 'she has penetration, instead of
love she has steadfastness, instead of hope she has trust.' Indeed I will confess that till I knew thee, I knew nothing
higher in the world than clearness and prudence: it was thy presence only that persuaded, animated, conquered
Chapter IV

254

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
me; to thy fair lofty soul I willingly give place. My friend too I honour on the same principle; the description of
his life is a perpetual seeking without finding; not empty seeking, but wondrous generous seeking; he fancies
others may give him what can proceed from himself alone. So, love, the clearness of my vision has not injured
me, on this occasion, more than others: I know my husband better than he knows himself, and I value him the
more. I see him, yet I see not over him; all my skill will not enable me to judge of what he can accomplish. When
I think of him, his image always blends itself with thine: I know not how I have deserved to belong to two such
persons. But I will deserve it, by endeavouring to do my duty, by fulfilling what is looked for from me." "If I
recollect Lothario? Vividly and daily. In the company which in thought surrounds me, I cannot want him for a
moment. O, what a pity for this noble character, related by an error of his youth to me, that nature has related him
to thee! A being such as thou, in truth, were worthier of him than I. To thee I could, I would surrender him. Let us
be to him all we can, till he find a proper wife; and then too let us be, let us abide together."
"But what shall we say to our friends?" began Natalia.−"Your brother does not know of it?"−"Not a hint; your
people know as little: we women have, on this occasion, managed the affair ourselves. Lydia had put some whims
into Theresa's head concerning Jarno and the Abbé. There are certain plans and secret combinations, with the
general scheme of which I am acquainted, and into which I never thought of penetrating farther. With regard to
these, Theresa has, through Lydia, taken up some shadow of suspicion: so in this decisive step she would not
suffer any one but me to influence her. With my brother it had been already settled, that they should merely
announced their marriages to one another, not giving or asking counsel on the subject."
Natalia wrote a letter to her brother; she invited Wilhelm to subjoin a word or two, Theresa having so desired it.
They were just about to seal, when Jarno unexpectedly sent up his name. His reception was of course as kind as
possible: he wore a sportful merry air; he could not long forbear to tell his errand. "I am come," said he, "to give
you very curious and very pleasing tidings: they concern Theresa. You have often blamed us, fair Natalia, for
troubling our heads about so many things; but now you see how good it is to have one's spies in every place.
Guess, and let us see your skill for once!"
The self−complacency with which he spoke these words, the roguish mien with which he looked at Wilhelm and
Natalia, persuaded both of them that he had found their secret. Natalia answered smiling: "We are far more skilful
than you think: before we even heard your riddle, we had put the answer to it down in black and white."
With these words, she handed him the letter to Lothario; satisfied at having met, in this way, the little triumph and
surprise he had meant for them. Jarno took the sheet with some astonishment: ran it quickly over: started; let it
drop from his hands, and stared at both his friends with an expression of amazement, nay of fright, which on his
countenance was rare. He spoke no word.
Wilhelm and Natalia were not a little struck; Jarno stept up and down the room. "What shall I say?" cried he: "Or
shall I say it at all? But it must come out; the perplexity is not to be avoided. So secret for secret; surprise against
surprise! Theresa is not the daughter of her reputed mother! The hindrance is removed: I came to ask you to
prepare her for a marriage with Lothario."
Jarno saw the shock which he had given his friends; they cast their eyes upon the ground. "The present case," said
he, "is one of those which are worse to bear in company. What each has to consider in it, he considers best in
solitude: I at least require an hour of leave." He hastened to the garden; Wilhelm followed him mechanically, yet
without approaching near.
At the end of an hour, they were again assembled. Wilhelm opened the conversation: "Formerly," said he, "while
I was living without plan or object, in a state of carelessness, or I may say of levity, friendship, love, affection,
trust came towards me with open arms, they pressed themselves upon me; but now when I am serious, destiny
appears to take another course with me. This resolution, of soliciting Theresa's hand, is probably the first that has
proceeded altogether from myself. I laid my plan considerately; my reason fully joined in it; by the consent of that
Chapter IV

255

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
noble maiden all my hopes were crowned. But now the strangest fate puts back my outstretched hand; Theresa
reaches hers to me, but from afar, as in a dream; I cannot grasp it; and the lovely image leaves me forever. So fare
thee well, thou lovely image! and all ye images of richest happiness that gathered round it!"
He was silent for a moment, looking out before him: Jarno was about to speak. "Let me have another word," cried
Wilhelm, "for the lot is drawing which is to decide the destiny of all my life. At this moment I am aided and
confirmed by the impression which Lothario's presence made upon me at the first glance, and which has ever
since continued with me. That man well merits every sort of friendship and affection; and without sacrifices
friendship cannot be imagined. For his sake, it was easy for me to delude a hapless girl; for his sake it shall be
possible for me to give away the worthiest bride. Return, relate the strange occurrence to him, and tell him what I
am prepared for."
"In emergencies like this," said Jarno, "I hold that everything is done, if one do nothing rashly. Let us take no step
till Lothario has agreed to it. I will go to him: wait patiently for my return, or for his letter."
He rode away; and left his friends in great disquiet. They had time to reconsider these events, to think of them
maturely. It now first occurred to them, that they had taken Jarno's statement simply by itself, and without
inquiring into any of the circumstances. Wilhelm was not altogether free from doubts: but next day, their
astonishment, nay their bewilderment, arose still higher, when a messenger arriving from Theresa, brought the
following letter to Natalia.
"Strange as it may seem, after all the letters I have sent, I am obliged to send another, begging that thou wouldst
dispatch my bridegroom to me instantly. He shall be my husband, what plans soever they may lay to rob me of
him. Give him the enclosed letter; only not before witnesses, whoever they may be!"
The enclosed letter was as follows: "What opinion will you form of your Theresa, when you see her all at once
insisting passionately on a union which calm reason alone appeared to have appointed? Let nothing hinder you
from setting out the moment you have read this letter. Come, my dear, dear friend; now three times dearer, since
they are attempting to deprive me of you."
"What is to be done?" cried Wilhelm, after he had read the letter.
"In no case that I remember," said Natalia, after some reflection, "have my heart and judgment been so dumb as in
the present one: what to do or to advise I know not."
"Can it be," cried Wilhelm vehemently, "that Lothario does not know of it; or if he does, that he is but like us, the
sport of hidden plans? Has Jarno, when he saw our letter, devised that fable on the spot? Would he have told us
something different, if we had not been so precipitate? What can they mean? What intentions can they have?
What plan can Theresa mean? Yes, it must be owned, Lothario is begirt with secret influences and combinations:
I myself have found that they are active, that they take certain charge of the proceedings, of the destiny of several
people, and contrive to guide them. The ulterior objects of these mysteries I know not; but their nearest purpose,
that of snatching my Theresa from me, I perceive but too distinctly. On the one hand, this prospect of Lothario's
happiness which they exhibit to me may be but a hollow show; on the other hand, I see my dear, my honoured
bride inviting me to her affection. What shall I do? What shall I forbear?"
"A little patience!" said Natalia; "a little time for thought! In these singular perplexities, I know but this, that what
can never be recalled should not be done in haste. To a fable, to an artful plan we have steadfastness and prudence
to oppose: whether Jarno has been speaking true or false must soon appear. If my brother has actually hopes of a
connexion with Theresa, it were hard to cut him off forever from that prospect, at the moment when it seems so
kindly inviting him. Let us wait at least till we discover whether he himself knows anything of it, whether he
believes and hopes."
Chapter IV

256

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
These prudent counsels were confirmed by a letter from Lothario. "I do not send Jarno," he wrote: "a line from
my hand is more to thee than the minutest narrative in the mouth of a messenger. I am certain, Theresa is not the
daughter of her reputed mother: and I cannot renounce hope of being hers, till she too is persuaded, and can then
decide between my friend and me with calm consideration. Let him not leave thee, I entreat it! The happiness, the
life of a brother is at stake. I promise thee, this uncertainty shall not be long."
"You see how the matter stands," said she to Wilhelm with a friendly air; "give me your word of honour that you
will not leave the house!"
"I give it," cried he, stretching out his hand; "I will not leave this house against your will. I thank Heaven, and my
better Genius, that on this occasion I am led, and led by you."
Natalia wrote Theresa an account of everything; declaring that she would not let her friend away. She sent
Lothario's letter also.
Theresa answered: "I wonder not a little that Lothario is himself convinced: to his sister he would not feign to this
extent. I am vexed, greatly vexed. It is better that I say no more. But I will come to thee, so soon as I have got
poor Lydia settled: they are treating her cruelly. I fear we are all betrayed, and shall be so betrayed that we shall
never reach the truth. If my friend were of my opinion, he would give thee the slip after all, and throw himself
into the arms of his Theresa, whom none shall take away from him. But I, as I dread, shall lose him, and not
regain Lothario. From the latter they are taking Lydia, by showing him afar off the prospect of obtaining me. I
will say no more: the entanglement will grow still deeper. Whether, in the mean time, these beautiful relations to
each other may not be so pushed aside, or undermined and broken down, that when the darkness passes off, the
mischief shall no longer admit of remedy, time will show. If my friend do not tear himself away, in a few days I
myself will come and seek him out beside thee, and hold him fast. Thou marvelest how this passion can have
gained the mastery of thy Theresa. It is no passion, but conviction; it is a belief that since Lothario can never be
mine, this new friend will make me happy. Tell him so, in the name of the little boy that sat with him underneath
the oak, and thanked him for his sympathy. Tell it him in the name of Theresa, who met his offers with a hearty
openness. My first dream of living with Lothario has wandered far away from my soul; the dream of living with
my other friend is yet wholly present to me. Do they hold me so light, as to think that it were easy to exchange the
former with the latter?"
"I depend on you," said Natalia to Wilhelm, handing him the letter: "you will not leave me. Consider that the
comfort of my life is in your hands. My being is so intimately bound and interwoven with my brother's, that he
feels no sorrow which I do not feel, no joy which does not likewise gladden me. Nay, I may truly say, through
him alone I have experienced that the heart can be affected and exalted; that in the world there may be joy, love
and an emotion which contents the soul beyond its utmost want."
She stopped; Wilhelm took her hand, and cried: "O continue! This is the time for a true mutual disclosure of our
thoughts: it never was more necessary for us to be well acquainted with each other."
"Yes, my friend!" said she, smiling, with her quiet, soft, indescribable dignity; "perhaps it is not out of season, if I
tell you that the whole of what so many books, of what the world holds up to us and names love, always seemed
to me a fable."
"You have never loved?" cried Wilhelm.
"Never, or always!" said Natalia.

Chapter IV

Chapter V
DURING this conversation, they kept walking up and down the garden, and Natalia gathered various flowers of
singular forms, entirely unknown to Wilhelm, who began to ask their names, and occupy himself about them.
"You know not," said Natalia, "for whom I have been plucking these? I intend them for my uncle, whom we are
to visit. The sun is shining even now so bright on the Hall of the Past, I must lead you in, this moment; and I
never go to it, without a few of the flowers which my uncle liked particularly, in my hand. He was a peculiar man,
susceptible of very strange impressions. For certain plants and animals, for certain neighbourhoods and persons,
nay for certain sorts of minerals, he had an especial love, which he was rarely able to explain. 'Had I not,' he
would often say, 'from youth, withstood myself, and striven to form my judgment upon wide and general
principles, I had been the narrowest and most intolerable person living. For nothing can be more intolerable than
circumscribed peculiarity, in one from whom a pure and suitable activity might be required.' And yet he was
obliged to confess, that life and breath would almost leave him, if he did not now and then indulge himself, not
from time to time allow himself a brief and passionate enjoyment of what he could not always praise and justify.
'It is not my fault,' said he, 'if I have not brought my inclinations and my reason into perfect harmony.' On such
occasions he would joke with me, and say: 'Natalia may be looked upon as happy while she lives: her nature asks
nothing which the world does not wish and use."'
So speaking, they arrived again at the house. Natalia led him through a spacious passage, to a door, before which
lay two granite Sphinxes. The door itself was in the Egyptian fashion, somewhat narrower above than below; and
its brazen leaves prepared one for a serious or even a gloomy feeling. Wilhelm was in consequence agreeably
surprised, when his expectation issued in a sentiment of pure cheerful serenity, as he entered a hall, where art and
life took away all recollection of death and the grave. In the walls all round, a series of proportionable arches had
been hollowed out, and large sarcophaguses stood in them: among the pillars in the intervals between them,
smaller openings might be seen, adorned with urns and similar vessels. The remaining spaces of the walls and
vaulted roof were regularly divided; and between bright and variegated borders, within garlands and other
ornaments, a multitude of cheerful and significant figures had been painted, upon grounds of different sizes. The
body of the edifice was covered with that fine yellow marble, which passes into reddish; clear blue stripes of a
chemical substance happily imitating lapis−lazuli, while they satisfied the eye with contrast, gave unity and
combination to the whole. All this pomp and decoration showed itself in the chastest architectural forms: and thus
every one who entered felt as if exalted above himself, while the coöperating products of art, for the first time,
taught him what man is and what he may become.
Opposite the door, on a stately sarcophagus, lay a marble figure of a noble−looking man, reclined upon a pillow.
He held a roll before him; and seemed to look at it with still attention. It was placed so that you could read with
ease the words which stood there: Think of living.
Natalia took away a withered bunch of flowers, and laid the fresh one down before the figure of her uncle. For it
was her uncle whom the marble represented: Wilhelm thought he recognised the features of the venerable
gentleman, whom he had seen, when lying wounded in the green of the forest. "Here he and I passed many an
hour," said Natalia, "while the hall was getting ready. In his latter years, he had gathered several skilful artists
round him; and his chief delight was to invent or superintend the drawings and cartoons for these pictures."
Wilhelm could not satisfy himself with looking at the objects which surrounded him. "What a life," exclaimed he,
"in this Hall of the Past! One might with equal justice name it Hall of the Present and the Future. Such all were,
such all will be. There is nothing transitory but the individual who looks at and enjoys it. Here, this figure of the
mother pressing her infant to her bosom will survive many generations of happy mothers. Centuries hence,
perhaps some father will take pleasure in contemplating this bearded man, who has laid aside his seriousness, and
is playing with his son. Thus shamefaced will the bride sit for ages, and amid her silent wishes, need that she be
Chapter V

258

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
comforted, that she be spoken to; thus impatient will the bridegroom listen on the threshold whether he may
enter."
The figures Wilhelm was surveying with such rapture were of almost boundless number and variety. From the
first jocund impulse of the child, merely to employ its every limb in sport, up to the peaceful sequestered
earnestness of the sage, you might, in fair and living order, see delineated how man possesses no capacity or
tendency without employing and enjoying it. From the first soft conscious feeling, when the maiden lingers in
pulling up her pitcher, and looks with satisfaction at her image in the clear fountain, to those high solemnities
when kings and nations invoke the Gods at the altar to witness their alliances, all was depicted, all was forcible
and full of meaning.
It was a world, it was a heaven, that in this abode surrounded the spectator; and beside the thoughts which those
polished forms suggested, beside the fellings they awoke, there still seemed something farther to be present,
something by which the whole man felt himself laid hold of. Wilhelm too observed this, though unable to account
for it. "What is this," exclaimed he, "which, independently of all signification, without any sympathy that human
incidents and fortunes may inspire us with, acts on me so strongly and so gracefully? It speaks to me from the
whole, it speaks from every part; thought I have not fully understood the former, though I do not specially apply
the latter to myself! What enchantment breathes from these surfaces, these lines, these heights and breadths, these
masses and colours! What is it that makes these figures so delightful, even when slightly viewed, and merely in
the light of decorations? Yes, I feel it: one might tarry here, might rest, might view the whole, and be happy; and
yet feel and think something altogether different from aught that stood before his eyes."
And certainly if we were able to describe how happily the whole was subdivided, how everything determined by
its place, by combination or by contrast, by uniformity or by variety, appeared exactly as it should have done,
producing an effort as perfect as distinct, we should transport the reader to a scene, from which he would not be in
haste to stir.
Four large marble candelabra rose in the corners of the hall; four smaller ones were in the midst of it, around a
very beautifully worked sarcophagus, which, judging from its size, might once have held a young person of
middle stature.
Natalia paused beside this monument; she laid her hand upon it as she said: "My worthy uncle had a great
attachment to this fine antique. 'It is not,' he would often say, 'the first blossoms alone that drop; such you can
keep above in these little spaces; but fruits also, which, hanging on their twigs, long give us the fairest hope,
whilst a secret worm is preparing their too early ripeness and their quick decay.' I fear," continued she, "his words
have been prophetic of that dear little girl, who seems withdrawing gradually from our cares, and bending to this
peaceful dwelling."
As they were about to go, Natalia stopped and said: "There is something still which merits your attention. Observe
these half−round openings aloft on both sides. Here the choir can stand concealed while singing; these iron
ornaments below the cornice serve for fastening−on the tapestry, which, by order of my uncle, must be hung
round at every burial. Music, particularly song, was a pleasure he could not live without: and it was one of his
peculiarities that he wished the singer not to be in view. 'In this respect,' he would say, 'they spoil us at the theatre;
the music there is, as it were, subservient to the eye; it accompanies movements, not emotions. In oratorios and
concerts, the form of the musician constantly disturbs us: true music is intended for the ear alone; a fine voice is
the most universal thing that can be figured; and while the narrow individual that uses it presents himself before
the eye, he cannot fail to trouble the effect of that pure universality. The person whom I am to speak with, I must
see, because it is a solitary man, whose form and character gives worth or worthlessness to what he says: but, on
the other hand, whoever sings to me must be invisible; his form must not confuse me, or corrupt my judgment.
Here, it is but one human organ speaking to another; it is not spirit speaking to spirit, not a thousandfold world to
the eye, not a heaven to the man.' On the same principles, in respect of instrumental music, he required that the
Chapter V

259

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
orchestra should as much as possible be hid; because by the mechanical exertions, by the mean and awkward
gestures of the performers, our feelings are so much dispersed and perplexed. Accordingly he always used to shut
his eyes while hearing music; thereby to concentrate his whole being on the single pure enjoyment of the ear."
They were about to leave the Hall, when they heard the children running hastily along the passage, and Felix
crying: "No, I! No, I!"
Mignon rushed in at the open door: she was foremost, but out of breath, and could not speak a word. Felix, still at
some distance, shouted out: "Mamma Theresa is come!" The children had run a race, as it seemed, to bring the
news. Mignon was lying in Natalia's arms, her heart was beating fiercely.
"Naughty child," said Natalia; "art thou not forbidden violent motions? See how thy heart is beating!"
"Let it break!" said Mignon with a deep sigh: "it has beat too long."
They had scarcely composed themselves from this surprise, this sort of consternation, when Theresa entered. She
flew to Natalia; clasped her and Mignon in her arms. Then turning round to Wilhelm, she looked at him with her
clear eyes, and said: "Well, my friend, how is it with you? You have not let them cheat you?" He made a step
towards her; she sprang to him, and hung upon his neck. "O my Theresa!" cried he.
"My friend, my love, my husband! Yes, forever thine!" cried she, amid the warmest kisses.
Felix pulled her by the gown, and cried: "Mamma Theresa, I am here too!" Natalia stood, and looked before her:
Mignon on a sudden clapped her left hand on her heart; and stretching out the right arm violently, fell with a
shriek at Natalia's feet, as dead.
The fright was great: no motion of the heart or pulse was to be traced. Wilhelm took her on his arm, and hastily
carried her away; the body hung lax over his shoulders. The presence of the Doctor was of small avail: he and the
young Surgeon, whom we know already, strove in vain. The dear little creature could not be recalled to life.
Natalia beckoned to Theresa: the latter took her friend by the hand and led him from the room. He was dumb, not
uttering a word; he durst not meet her eyes. He sat down with her upon the sofa, where he had first found Natalia.
He thought with great rapidity along a series of fateful incidents, or rather he did not think, but let his soul be
worked on by the thoughts which would not leave it. There are moments in life, when past events, like winged
shuttles, dart to and fro before us, and by their incessant movements weave a web, which we ourselves, in a
greater or less degree, have spun and put upon the loom. "My friend, my love!" said Theresa, breaking silence, as
she took him by the hand: "Let us stand together firmly in this hour, as we perhaps shall often have to do in
similar hours. These are occurrences, which it takes two united hearts to suffer. Think, my friend, feel that thou
art not alone; show that thou lovest thy Theresa by imparting thy sorrows to her!" She embraced him, and drew
him softly to her bosom: he clasped her in his arms and pressed her strongly towards him. "The poor child," cried
he, "used in mournful moments to seek shelter and protection in my unstable bosom: let the stability of thine
assist me in this heavy hour." They held each other fast; he felt her heart beat against his breast; but in his spirit all
was desolate and void; only the figures of Mignon and Natalia flitted like shadows across the waste of his
imagination.
Natalia entered. "Give us thy blessing!" cried Theresa: "Let us, in this melancholy moment, be united before
thee!" Wilhelm had hid his face upon Theresa's neck: he was so far relieved that he could weep. He did not hear
Natalia come; he did not see her; but at the sound of her voice his tears redoubled. "What God has joined I will
not part," she answered, smiling; "but to unite you is not in my power; nor am I gratified to see that sorrow and
sympathy seem altogether to have banished from your hearts the recollection of my brother." At these words,
Wilhelm started from Theresa's arms. "Whither are you going?" cried the ladies. "Let me see the child," said he,
Chapter V

260

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
"whom I have killed! Misfortune when we look upon it with our eyes is smaller than when our imagination sinks
the evil down into the recesses of the soul. Let us view the departed angel! Her serene countenance will say to us
that it is well with her." As his friends could not restrain the agitated youth, they followed him; but the worthy
Doctor with the Surgeon met them, and prevented them from coming near the dead. "Keep away from this
mournful object," said he; "and allow me, so far as I am able, to give some continuance to these remains. On this
dear and singular being I will now display the beautiful art not only of embalming bodies, but of retaining in them
a look of life. As I foresaw her death, the preparations are already made; with these helps I shall undoubtedly
succeed. Give me but a few days, and ask not to see the child again till I have brought her to the Hall of the Past."
The young Surgeon had in his hands that well−known case of instruments. "From whom can he have got it?"
Wilhelm asked the Doctor. "I know it very well," replied Natalia: "he has it from his father, who dressed your
wounds when we found you in the forest."
"Then I have not been mistaken! I recognised the band at once!" cried Wilhelm. "O get it for me! It was this that
first gave me any hint of my unknown benefactress. What weal and woe will such a thing survive! Beside how
many sorrows has this band already been, and its threads still hold together! How many men's last moments has it
witnessed, and its colours are not yet faded! It was near me in one of the fairest hours of my existence, when I lay
wounded on the ground, and your helpful from appeared before me, and the child whom we are now lamenting sat
with its bloody hair, busied with the tenderest care to save my life!"
It was not long that our friends could converse about this sad occurrence; that Theresa could inquire about the
child, and the probable cause of its unexpected death: for strangers were announced; who, on making their
appearance, proved to be well−known strangers. Lothario, Jarno and the Abbé entered. Natalia met her brother:
among the rest, there was a momentary silence. Theresa, smiling on Lothario, said: "You scarcely expected to find
me here; of course, it would not have been advisable that we should visit one another at the present time:
however, after such an absence, take my cordial welcome."
Lothario took her hand, and answered: "If we are to suffer and renounce, it may as well take place in the presence
of the object whom we love and wish for. I desire no influence on your determination; my confidence in your
heart, in your understanding and clear sense, is still so great, that I willingly commit to your disposal my fate and
that of my friend."
The conversation turned immediately to general, nay we may say, to trivial topics. The company soon separated
into single pairs, for walking. Natalia was with her brother; Theresa with the Abbé our friend was left with Jarno
in the Castle.
The appearance of the guests at the moment when a heavy sorrow was oppressing Wilhelm, had, instead of
dissipating his attention, irritated him and made him worse: he was fretful and suspicious, and unable or uncareful
to conceal it, when Jarno questioned him about his sulky silence. "What is the use of saying more?" cried
Wilhelm. "Lothario with his helpers is come: and it were strange if those mysterious watchmen of the tower, who
are constantly so busy, did not now exert their influence on us, to effect I know not what strange purpose. So far
as I have known these saintly gentlemen, it seems to be in every case their laudable endeavour to separate the
united, and to unite the separated. What sort of web their weaving will produce, may probably to unholy eyes be
forever a riddle."
"You are cross and bitter," said the other; "that is as it should be. Would you get into a proper passion, it were still
better."
"That too might come about," said Wilhelm: "I fear much some of you are in the mind to load my patience,
natural and acquired, beyond what it will bear."

Chapter V

261

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
"In the mean time," said the other, "till we see what is to be the issue of the matter, I could like to tell you
somewhat of the tower, which you appear to view with such mistrust."
"It stands with you," said Wilhelm, "whether you will risk your eloquence on an attention so distracted. My mind
is so engaged at present, that I know not whether I can take a proper interest in these very dignified adventures."
"Your pleasing humour shall not hinder me," said Jarno, "from explaining this affair to you. You reckon me a
clever fellow; I want to make you reckon me an honest one; and what is more, on this occasion I am bidden
speak."−"I could wish," said Wilhelm, "that you did it of yourself, and with an honest purpose to inform me; but
as I cannot hear without suspicion, wherefore should I hear at all?"−"If I have nothing better to do," said Jarno,
"than tell you stories, you too have time to listen to me; and to this you may perhaps feel more inclined, when I
assure you, that all you saw in the tower was but the relics of a youthful undertaking, in regard to which the
greater part of the initiated were once in deep earnest, though all of them now view it with a smile."
"So, with these pompous signs and words, you do but mock?" cried Wilhelm. "With a solemn air, you lead us to a
place inspiring reverence by its aspect; you make the strangest visions pass before us; you give us rolls full of
glorious mystic apophthegms, of which in truth we understand but little; you disclose to us, that hitherto we have
been pupils; you solemnly pronounce us free; and we are just as wise as we were."−"Have you not the parchment
by you?" said the other. "It contains a deal of sense: those general apophthegms were not picked up at random;
though they seem obscure and empty to a man without experiences to recollect while reading them. But give me
the Indenture as we call it, if it is at hand."−"Quite at hand," cried Wilhelm; "such an amulet well merits being
worn upon one's breast."−"Well," said Jarno, smiling, "who knows whether the contents of it may not one day
find place in your head and heart?"
He opened the Roll, and glanced over the first half of it. "This," said he, "regards the cultivation of our gifts for art
and science; of which let others speak: the second treats of life; here I am more at home."
He then began to read passages, speaking between whiles, and connecting them with his remarks and narrative.
"The taste of youth for secrecy, for ceremonies, for imposing words, is extraordinary; and frequently bespeaks a
certain depth of character. In those years, we wish to feel our whole nature seized and moved, even though it be
but vaguely and darkly. The youth who happens to have lofty aspirations and forecastings, thinks that secrets, and
effect much by means of them. It was with such views that the Abbé favoured a certain Society of young men;
partly according to his principle of aiding every tendency of nature, partly out of habit and inclination; for in
former times he had himself been joined to an association, which appears to have accomplished many things in
secret. For this business I was least of all adapted. I was older than the rest; from youth I had thought clearly; I
wished in all things nothing more than clearness; I felt no interest in men, but to know them as they were. With
the same taste I gradually infected all the best of our associates; and this circumstance had almost given a false
direction to our plan of culture. For we now began to look at nothing but the errors and the narrowness of others,
and to think ourselves a set of highly−gifted personages. Here the Abbé came to our assistance: he taught us, that
we never should inspect the conduct of men, unless we at the same time took an interest in improving it; and that
through action only could we ever be in a condition to inspect and watch ourselves. He advised us, however, to
retain the primary forms of the Society: hence there was still a sort of law in our proceedings; the first mystic
impressions might be traced in the constitution of the whole.
At length, as by a practical similitude, it took the form of a corporate trade, whose business was the arts. Hence
came the names of Apprentices, Assistants, and Masters. We wished to see with our own eyes, and to form for
ourselves a special record of our own experience in the world. Hence those numerous confessions, which in part
we ourselves wrote, in part made others write; and out of which the several Apprenticeships were afterwards
compiled. The formation of his character is not the chief concern with every man. Many merely wish to find a sort
of recipe for comfort, directions for acquiring riches, or whatever good they aim at. All such, when they would
not be instructed in their proper duties, we were wont to mystify, to treat with juggleries and every sort of
Chapter V

262

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
hocus−pocus, and at length to shove aside. We advanced none to the rank of Masters, but such as clearly felt and
recognised the purpose they were born for, and had got enough of practice to proceed along their way with a
certain cheerfulness and ease."
"In my case, then," cried Wilhelm, "your ceremony has been very premature; for since the day when you
pronounced me free, what I can, will, or shall do, has been more unknown to me than ever."−"We are not to
blame for this perplexity; perhaps good fortune will deliver us. In the mean time listen: 'He in whom there is much
to be developed will be later in acquiring true perceptions of himself and of the world. There are few who at once
have Thought and the capacity of Action. Thought expands, but lames; Action animates, but narrows."'
"I beg of you," cried Wilhelm, "not to read me any more of that surprising stuff. These phrases have sufficiently
confused me before."−"I will stick by my story, then," said Jarno, half rolling up the parchment, into which,
however, he kept casting frequent glances. "I myself have been of less service to the cause of our Society and of
my fellowmen than any other member. I am but a bad schoolmaster; I cannot bear to look on people making
awkward trials; when I see a person wandering from his path, I feel constrained to call to him, although it were a
night−walker going straight to break his neck. On this point, I had a continual struggle with the Abbé, who
maintains that error can never be cured except by erring. About you, too, we often argued. He had taken an
especial liking to you; and it is saying something to have caught so much of his attention. For me, you must
admit, that every time we met, I told you just the naked truth."−"Certainly, you spared me very little," said the
other, "and I think you still continue faithful to your principles."−"What is the use of sparing," answered Jarno,
"when a young man of many good endowments is taking a quite false direction?"−"Pardon me," said Wilhelm,
"you have rigorously enough denied me any talent for the stage; I confess to you, that though I have entirely
renounced the art, I cannot think myself entirely incapable."−"And with me," said Jarno, "it is well enough
decided, that a person who can only play himself is no player. Whoever cannot change himself, in temper and in
form, into many forms, does not deserve the name. Thus you, for example, acted Hamlet and some other
characters extremely well; because in these, your form, your disposition and the temper of the moment suited. For
an amateur theatre, for any one who saw no other way before him, this would perhaps have answered well
enough. But," continued Jarno, looking on the roll, "'we should guard against a talent which we cannot hope to
practise in perfection. Improve it as we may, we shall always in the end, when the merit of the master has become
apparent to us, painfully lament the loss of time and strength devoted to such botching."'
"Do not read!" cried Wilhelm: "I entreat you earnestly; speak on, tell, inform me! So the Abbé aided me in
Hamlet: he provided me a ghost?"−"Yes; for he asserted that it was the only way of curing you, if you were
curable."−"And on this account he left the veil, and bade me fly?"−"Yes, he hoped that having fairly acted
Hamlet, your desire of acting would be satiated. He maintained that you would never go upon the stage again: I
believed the countrary, and I was right. We argued on the subject, that very evening when the play was
over."−"You saw me act, then?"−"I did indeed."−"And who was it that played the Ghost?"−"That I cannot tell
you; either the Abbé or his twin brother; but I think the latter, for he is a little taller."−"You have secrets from
each other, then?"−"Friends may and must have secrets from each other; but they are not secrets to each other."
"The very thought of that perplexity perplexes me. Let me understand the man, to whom I owe so many thanks as
well as such reproaches."
"What gives him such a value in our estimation," answered Jarno, "what in some degree secures him the dominion
over all of us, is the free sharp eye that nature has bestowed on him for all the powers which dwell in man, and are
susceptible of cultivation, each according to its kind. Most men, even the most accomplished, are but limited:
each prizes certain properties in others and himself; these alone he favours, these alone will he have cultivated.
Directly the reverse is the procedure of our Abbé: for every gift he has a feeling; every gift he delights to
recognise and forward. But I must look into my roll again! 'It is all men that make up mankind; all powers taken
together that make up the world. These are frequently at variance: and as they endeavour to destroy each other,
Nature holds them together, and again produces them. From the first animal tendency to handicraft attempts, up to
Chapter V

263

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
the highest practising of intellectual art; from the inarticulate crowings of the happy infant, up to the polished
utterance of the orator and singer; from the first bickerings of boys up to the vast equipments by which countries
are conquered and retained; from the slightest kindliness and the most transitory love, up to the fiercest passion
and the most earnest covenant; from the merest perception of sensible presence up to the faintest presentiments
and hopes of the remotest spiritual future; all this and much more also lies in man, and must be cultivated: yet not
in one, but in many. Every gift is valuable, and ought to be unfolded. When one encourages the beautiful alone,
and another encourages the useful alone, it takes them both to form a man. The useful encourages itself; for the
multitude produce it, and no one can dispense with it: the beautiful must be encouraged; for few can set it forth,
and many need it."'
"Hold! hold!" cried Wilhelm: "I have read it all."−"Yet a line or two!" said Jarno: "Here is our worthy Abbé to a
hairsbreadth: 'One power rules another; none can cultivate another: in each endowment, and not elsewhere, lies
the force which must complete it: this many people do not understand, who yet attempt to teach and
influence."'−"I too do not understand it," answered Wilhelm.−"You will often hear the Abbé preach on this text;
and, therefore, 'Let us merely keep a clear and steady eye on what is in ourselves; on what endowments of our
own we mean to cultivate; let us be just to others; for we ourselves are only to be valued in so far as we can
value."'−"For Heaven's sake, no more of these wise saws! I feel them to be but a sorry balsam for a wounded
heart. Tell me rather, with your cruel settledness, what you expect of me, how and in what manner you intend to
sacrifice me."−"For every such suspicion, I assure you, you will afterwards beg our pardon. It is your affair to try
and choose; it is ours to aid you. A man is never happy till his vague striving has itself marked out its proper
limitation. It is not to me that you must look, but to the Abbé: it is not of yourself that you must think, but of what
surrounds you. Thus, for instance, learn to understand Lothario's superiority; how his quick and comprehensive
vision is inseparably united with activity; how he constantly advances; how he expands his influence, and carries
every one along with him. Wherever he may be, he bears a world about with him: his presence animates and
kindles. Observe our good Physician, on the other hand! His nature seems to be directly the reverse. If the former
only works upon the general whole, and at a distance, the latter turns his piercing eye upon the things that are
beside him; he rather furnishes the means for being active, than himself displays or stimulates activity. His
conduct is exactly like the conduct of a good domestic manager; he is busied silently, while he provides for each
in his peculiar sphere; his knowledge is a constant gathering and expending, a taking in and giving out on the
small scale. Perhaps Lothario in a single day might overturn what the other had for years been employed in
building up: but perhaps Lothario also might impart to others, in a moment, strength sufficient to restore a
hundredfold what he had overturned."−"It is but a sad employment," answered Wilhelm, "to contemplate the
sublime advantages of others at a moment when we are at variance with ourselves. Such contemplations suit the
man at ease; not him whom passion and uncertainty are agitating."−"Peacefully and reasonably to contemplate is
at no time hurtful," answered Jarno: "and while we use ourselves to think of the advantages of others, our own
mind comes insensibly to imitate them; and every false activity, to which our fancy was alluring us, is then
willingly abandoned. Free your mind, if you can, from all suspicion and anxiety. Here comes the Abbé: be
courteous towards him, till you have learned still farther what you owe him. The rogue! There he goes between
Natalia and Theresa; I could bet he is contriving something. As in general he likes to act the part of Destiny a
little; so he does not fail to show a taste for making matches, when he finds an opportunity."
Wilhelm, whose angry and fretful humour all the placid prudent words of Jarno had not bettered, thought his
friend exceedingly indelicate for mentioning marriage at a moment like the present; he answered with a smile
indeed, but a rather bitter one: "I thought the taste for making matches had been left to those that had a taste for
one another."

Chapter VI
THE COMPANY had met again; the conversation of our friends was necessarily interrupted. Ere long a courier
was announced, as wishing to deliver with his own hand a letter to Lothario. The man was introduced: he had a
Chapter VI

264

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
vigorous sufficient look; his livery was rich and handsome. Wilhelm thought he knew him: nor was he mistaken;
for it was the man whom he had sent to seek Philina and the fancied Mariana, and who never came back. Our
friend was about to address him, when Lothario, who had read the letter, asked the courier with a serious, almost
angry tone: "What is your master's name?"
"Of all questions," said the other with a prudent air, "this is the one which I am least prepared to answer. I hope
the letter will communicate the necessary information: verbally I have been charged with nothing."
"Be it as it will," replied Lothario with a smile; "since your master puts such trust in me as to indite a letter so
exceedingly facetious, he shall be welcome to us."−"He will not keep you long waiting for him," said the courier
with a bow, and withdrew.
"Do but hear the distracted stupid message," said Lothario.
"'As of all guests, Good Humour is believed to be the most agreeable wherever he appears, and as I always keep
that gentleman beside me by way of travelling companion, I feel persuaded that the visit I intend to pay your
noble Lordship will not be taken ill; on the contrary, I hope the whole of your illustrious family will witness my
arrival with complete satisfaction; and in due time also my departure; being always, et cetera, Count of
Snailfoot."'
"'Tis a new family," said the Abbé.
"A vicariat count, perhaps," said Jarno.
"The secret is easy to unriddle," said Natalia: "I wager it is none but brother Friedrich, who has threatened us with
a visit ever since my uncle's death."
"Right! fair and skilful sister!" cried a voice from the nearest thicket; and immediately a pleasant, cheerful youth
stept forward. Wilhelm could scarcely restrain a cry of wonder. "How?" exclaimed he: "Does our fair−haired
knave, too, meet me here?" Friedrich looked attentively, and recognising Wilhelm, cried: "In truth it would not
have astonished me so much to have beheld the famous Pyramids, which still stand fast in Egypt, or the grave of
King Mausolus, which, as I am told, does not exist, here placed before me in my uncle's garden, as to find you in
it, my old friend, and frequent benefactor. Accept my best and heartiest service!"
After he had kissed and complimented the whole circle, he again sprang towards Wilhelm, crying: "Use him well,
this hero, this leader of armies, and dramatical philosopher! When we became acquainted first, I dressed his hair
indifferently, I may say execrably; yet he afterwards saved me from a pretty load of blows. He is magnanimous as
Scipio, munificent as Alexander; at times he is in love, yet he never hates his rivals. Far from heaping coals of fire
on the heads of his enemies,−a piece of service, I am told, which we can do for any one,−he rather, when his
friends have carried off his love, dispatches good and trusty servants after them, that they may not strike their feet
against a stone."
In the same style, he ran along with a volubility which baffled all attempts to restrain it; and as no one could reply
to him in that vein, he had the conversation mostly to himself. "Do not wonder," cried he, "that I am so
profoundly versed in sacred and profane writers: you shall hear by and by how I attained my learning." They
wished to know how matters stood with him, where he had been; but crowds of proverbs and old stories choked
his explanation.
Natalia whispered to Theresa: "His gaiety afflicts me; I am sure at heart he is not merry."

Chapter VI

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
As, except a few jokes which Jarno answered, Friedrich's merriment was met by no response from those about
him, he was obliged at last to say: "Well, there is nothing left for me, but among so many grave faces to be grave
myself. And as in such a solemn scene, the burden of my sins falls heavy on my soul, I must honestly resolve
upon a general confession; for which, however, you, my worthy gentlemen and ladies, shall not be a jot the wiser.
This honourable friend already knows a little of my walk and conversation; he alone shall know the rest; and this
the rather, as he alone has any cause to ask about it. Are not you," continued he to Wilhelm, "curious about the
how and where, the when and wherefore? And how it stands with the conjugation of the Greek verb /??/ and the
derivatives of that very amiable part of speech?"
He then took Wilhelm by the arm, and led him off, pressing him and skipping round him with the liveliest air of
kindness.
Scarcely had they entered Wilhelm's room, when Friedrich noticed, in the window, a powder−knife, with the
inscription, Think of me. "You keep your valuables well laid up!" said he: "This is the powder−knife Philina gave
you, when I pulled your locks for you. I hope, in looking at it, you have diligently thought of that fair damsel: I
assure you, she has not forgotten you; if I had not long ago obliterated every trace of jealousy from my heart, I
could not look on you without envy."
"Talk no more of that creature," answered Wilhelm. "I confess, it was a while before I could get rid of the
impression, which her looks and manner made on me; but that was all."
"Fy! fy!" cried Friedrich: "would any one deny his deary? You loved her as completely as a man could wish. No
day passed without your giving her some present; and when a German gives, you may be sure he loves. No
alternative remained for me but whisking her away from you; and in this the little red officer at last succeeded."
"How! You were the officer whom we discovered with her, whom she travelled off with?"
"Yes," said Friedrich, "whom you took for Mariana. We had sport enough at the mistake."
"What cruelty," cried Wilhelm, "to leave me in such suspense!"
"And besides to take the courier, whom you sent to catch us, into pay!" said Friedrich. "He is a very active fellow;
we have kept him by us ever since. And the girl herself I love as desperately as ever. She has managed me in
some peculiar style: I am almost in a mythologic case; every day I tremble at the thought of being
metamorphosed."
"But tell me, pray," said Wilhelm, "where have you acquired this stock of erudition? It surprises me to hear the
strange way you have assumed of speaking always with a reference to ancient histories and fables."
"It was by a pleasant plan," said Friedrich, "that I got my learning. Philina lives with me at present: we have got a
lease of an old knightly castle from the farmer in whose ground it is: and there we live, with the hobgoblins of the
place, as merrily as possible. In one of the rooms, we found a small but choice library, consisting of a folio Bible,
Gottfried's Chronicle, two volumes of the Theatrum Europoeum, an Acerra Philologica, Gryphius' Writings, and
some other less important works. As we now and then, when tired of romping, felt the time hang heavy on our
hands, we proposed to read some books; and before we were aware, the time hung heavier than ever. At last,
Philina hit upon the royal plan of laying all the tomes, opened at once, upon a large table: we sat down opposite to
one another: we read to one another; always in detached passages, first from this book, then from that. Here was a
proper pleasure! We felt now as if we were in good society, where it is reckoned unbecoming to dwell on any
subject, or search it to the bottom; we thought ourselves in witty gay society, where none will let his neighbour
speak. We regularly treat ourselves with this diversion every day; and the erudition we obtain from it is quite
surprising. Already there is nothing new for us under the sun; on everything we see or hear, our learning offers us
Chapter VI

266

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
a hint. This method of instruction we diversify in many ways. Frequently we read by an old spoiled sandglass,
which runs in a minute or two. The moment it is down, the silent party turns it round like lightning, and
commences reading from his book; and no sooner is it down again, than the other cuts him short, and starts the
former topic. Thus we study in a truly academic manner: only our hours are shorter, and our studies are extremely
varied."
"This rioting is quite conceivable," said Wilhelm, "when a pair like you two are together: but how a pair so full of
frolic stay together, does not seem so easily conceivable."
"It is our good fortune," answered Friedrich, "and our bad. Philina dare not let herself be seen, she cannot bear to
see herself, she is in the family way. Nothing ever was so ludicrous and shapeless in the world. A little while
before I came away, she chanced to cast an eye upon the lookingglass in passing. 'Faugh!' cried she, and turned
away her face: 'the living picture of the Frau Melina! Shocking figure! One looks entirely deplorable!"'
"I confess," said Wilhelm with a smile, "it must be rather farcical to see a father and a mother such as you and she
together."
"'Tis a foolish business," answered Friedrich, "that I must, at last, be raised to the paternal dignity. But she asserts,
and the time agrees. At first that cursed visit which she paid you after Hamlet gave me qualms."
"What visit?"
"I suppose you have not quite slept off the memory of it yet? The pretty, flesh−and−blood spirit of that night, if
you do not know it, was Philina. The story was in truth a hard dower for me; but if we cannot be content with
such things, we should not be in love. Fatherhood at any rate depends entirely upon conviction: I am convinced,
and so I am a father. There, you see, I can employ my logic in the proper season too. And if the brat do not laugh
itself to death so soon as it is born, it may prove, if not a useful, at least a pleasant citizen of this world."
Whilst our friends were talking thus of mirthful subjects, the rest of the party had begun a serious conversation.
Scarcely were Friedrich and Wilhelm gone, when the Abbéled his friends, as if by chance, into a garden−house;
and having got them seated, thus addressed them:
"We have in general terms asserted that Fräulein Theresa was not the daughter of her reputed mother: it is fit that
we should now explain ourselves on this matter, in detail. I shall relate the story to you, which I undertake to
prove and to elucidate in every point.
"Frau von spent the first years of her wedlock in the utmost concord with her husband; only they had this
misfortune, that the children she brought him came into the world dead; and on occasion of the third, the mother
was declared by the Physicians to be on the verge of death, and to be sure of death if she should ever have
another. The parties were obliged to take their resolution: they would not break the marriage; it was too suitable to
both, in a civil point of view. Frau von sought in the culture of her mind, in a certain habit of display, in the joys
of vanity, a compensation for the happiness of motherhood which was refused her.
She cheerfully indulged her husband, when she noticed in him an attachment to a young lady, who had sole
charge of their domestic economy; a person of beautiful exterior, and very solid character. Frau von herself, ere
long, assisted in procuring an arrangement; by which the lady yielded to the wishes of Theresa's father; continuing
to discharge her household duties, and testifying to the mistress of the family, if possible, a more submissive zeal
to serve her than before.
"After a while, she declared herself with child: and both the father and his wife, on this occasion, though from
very different causes, fell upon the same idea. Herr von wished to have the offspring of his mistress educated in
Chapter VI

267

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
the house as his lawful child; and Frau von , angry that the indiscretion of her Doctor had allowed some whisper
of her condition to go abroad, proposed by a supposititious child to counteract this; and likewise to retain, by such
compliance, the superiority in her household, which otherwise she was like to lose. However, she was more
backward than her husband: she observed his purpose; and contrived, without any formal question, to facilitate his
explanation. She made her own terms; obtaining almost everything that she required; and hence the will, in which
so little care was taken of the child. The old Doctor was dead: they applied to a young, active and discreet
successor; he was well rewarded; he looked forward to the credit of exposing and remedying the unskilfulness and
premature decision of his deceased colleague. The true mother, not unwillingly, consented; they managed the
deception very well; Theresa came into the world, and was surrendered to a stepmother, while her mother fell a
victim to the plot; having died by venturing out too early, and left the father inconsolable.
"Frau von had thus attained her object; in the eyes of the world she had a lovely child, which she paraded with
excessive vanity; and she had also been delivered from a rival, whose fortune she envied, and whose influence, at
least in prospect, she beheld with apprehension. The infant she loaded with her tenderness; and by affecting, in
trustful hours, a lively feeling for her husband's loss, she gained mastery of his heart; so that in a manner he
surrendered all to her; laid his own happiness and that of his child in her hands; nor was it till a short while prior
to his death, and in some degree by the exertions of his grown−up daughter, that he again assumed the rule in his
own house. This, fair Theresa, was in all probability the secret, which your father, in his last sickness, so struggled
to communicate; this is what I wish to lay circumstantially before you, at a moment when our young friend, who
by a strange concurrence has become your bridegroom, happens to be absent. Here are the papers, which will
prove in the most rigorous manner everything that I have stated. You will also see from them how long I have
been following the trace of this discovery, though till now I could never attain certainty respecting it. I did not risk
imparting to my friend the possibility of such a happiness; it would have wounded him too deeply, had this hope a
second time deceived him. You will understand poor Lydia's suspicions: I readily confess, I nowise favoured the
attachment of our friend to her, whenever I began to look for a connexion with Theresa."
To this recital no one replied. The ladies, some days afterwards, returned the papers, not making any farther
mention of them.
There were other matters in abundance to engage the party when they were together; and the scenery around was
so delightful, that our friends, singly or in company, on horseback, in carriages, or on foot, delighted to explore it.
On one of these of excursions, Jarno took an opportunity of opening the affair to Wilhelm: he delivered him the
papers; not, however, seeming to require from him any resolution in regard to them.
"In the singular position I am placed in," said our friend, "I need only repeat to you what I said at first, in presence
of Natalia, and with the clear intention to fulfil it. Lothario and his friends may require of me every sort of
self−denial: I here abandon in their favour all pretensions to Theresa; do you procure me, in return, a formal
discharge. There requires no great reflection to decide. For some days, I have noticed that Theresa has to make an
effort in retaining any show of the vivacity with which she welcomed me at first. Her affection is gone from me,
or rather I have never had it."
"Such affairs are more conveniently explained," said Jarno, "by a gradual process, in silence and expectation, than
by many words, which always cause a sort of fermentation and embarrassment."
"I rather think," said Wilhelm, "that precisely this affair admits of the most clear and calm decision on the spot. I
have often been reproached with hesitation and uncertainty; why will you now, when I do not hesitate, commit
against myself the fault you have often blamed in me? Do our neighbours take such trouble with our training, only
to let us feel that they themselves are untrained? Yes, grant me soon the cheerful thought that I am out of a
mistaken project, into which I entered with the purest feelings in the world."

Chapter VI

268

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Notwithstanding this request, some days elapsed without his hearing any more of the affair, or observing any
farther alteration in his friends. The conversation, on the contrary, was general and of indifferent matters.

Chapter VII
JARNO and Wilhelm were sitting one day by Natalia. "You are thoughtful, Jarno," said the lady; "I have seen it in
your looks for some time."
"I am so," answered Jarno: "a weighty business is before me, which we have for years been meditating, and must
now begin to execute. You already know the outline of it: I may speak of it before our friend; for it will depend on
himself, whether he too shall not share in it. You are going to get rid of me, before long: I mean to take a voyage
to America."
"To America?" said Wilhelm smiling: "Such an adventure I did not anticipate from you; still less that you would
have selected me for a companion."
"When you rightly understand our plan," said Jarno, "you will give it a more honourable name; and perhaps
yourself be tempted to embark in it. Listen to me. It requires but a slight acquaintance with the business of the
world to see that mighty changes are at hand, that property is almost nowhere quite secure."
"Of the business of the world I have no clear notion," interrupted Wilhelm; "and it is but of late that I ever thought
about my property. Perhaps I had done well to drive it out of my head still longer; the care of securing it, appears
to give us hypochondria."
"Hear me out," said Jarno: "Care beseems ripe age, that youth may live for a time free from care: in the conduct of
poor mortals, equilibrium cannot be restored except by contraries. As matters go, it is anything but prudent to
have property in only one place, to commit your money to a single spot; and it is difficult again to guide it well in
many. We have therefore thought of something else. From our old tower there is a society to issue, which must
spread itself through every quarter of the world, and to which members from every quarter of the world shall be
admissible. We shall insure a competent subsistence to each other, in the single case of a revolution happening,
which might drive any part of us entirely from their possessions. I am now proceeding to America, to profit by the
good connexions which our friend established while he stayed there. The Abbé means to go to Russia: if you like
to join us, you shall have the choice of continuing in Germany to help Lothario, or of accompanying me. I
conjecture you will choose the latter: to take a distant journey is extremely serviceable to a young man."
Wilhelm thought a moment, and replied: "The offer well deserves consideration; for ere long the word with me
must be, The farther off the better. You will let me know your plan, I hope, more perfectly. It is perhaps my
ignorance of life that makes me think so; but such a combination seems to me to be attended with insuperable
difficulties."
"The most of which, till now, have been avoided," answered Jarno, "by the circumstance, that we have been but
few in number, honourable, discreet, determined people, animated by a certain general feeling, out of which alone
the feeling proper for societies can spring."−"And if you speak me fair," said Friedrich, who hitherto had only
listened, "I too will go along with you." Jarno shook his head.
"Well, what objections can you make?" cried Friedrich. "In a new colony, young colonists will be required; these
I bring with me: merry colonists will also be required; of these I make you certain. Besides, I recollect a certain
damsel, who is out of place on this side of the water, the fair, soft−hearted Lydia. What is the poor thing to do
with her sorrow and mourning, unless she get an opportunity to throw it to the bottom of the sea, unless some
brave fellow take her by the hand? You, my benefactor," said he, turning towards Wilhelm, "you have a taste for
Chapter VII

269

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
comforting forsaken persons: what withholds you now? Each of us might take his girl under his arm, and trudge
with Jarno."
This proposal struck Wilhelm offensively. He answered with affected calmness; "I know not whether she is
unengaged; and as in general I seem to be unfortunate in courtship, I shall hardly think of making the attempt."
"Brother Friedrich," said Natalia, "though thy own conduct is so full of levity, it does not follow that such
sentiments will answer others. Our friend deserves a heart that shall belong to him alone, that shall not at his side
be moved by foreign recollections. It was only with a character as pure and reasonable as Theresa's, that such a
venture could be risked."
"Risk!" cried Friedrich: "In love it is all risk. In the grove or at the altar, with a clasp of the arms or a golden ring,
by the chirping of the cricket or the sound of trumpets and kettledrums, it is all but a risk; chance does it all."
"I have often noticed," said Natalia, "that our principles are just a supplement to our peculiar manner of existence.
We delight to clothe our errors in the garb of universal laws; to attribute them to irresistibly−appointed causes. Do
but think, by what a path thy dear will lead thee, now that she has drawn thee towards her, and holds thee fast
there."
"She herself is on a very pretty path," said Friedrich, "on the path to saintship. A by−path, it is true, and somewhat
roundabout; but the pleasanter and surer for that. Maria of Magdala travelled it, and who can say how many
more? But on the whole, sister, when the point in hand is love, thou shouldst not mingle in it. In my opinion, thou
wilt never marry, till a bride is lacking somewhere; in that case, thou wilt give thyself, with thy habitual charity,
to be the supplement of some peculiar manner of existence; not otherwise. So let us strike a bargain with this
soul−breaker, and agree about our travelling company."
"You come too late with your proposals," answered Jarno; "Lydia is disposed of."
"And how?" cried Friedrich.
"I myself have offered her my hand," said Jarno.
"Old gentleman," said Friedrich, "you have done a feat to which, if we regard it as a substantive, various
adjectives might be appended; various predicates, if we regard it as a subject."
"I must honestly confess," replied Natalia, "it appears a dangerous experiment to make a helpmate of a woman, at
the very moment when her love for another man is like to drive her to despair."
"I have ventured," answered Jarno; "under a certain stipulation, she is to be mine. And, believe me, there is
nothing in the world more precious than a heart susceptible of love and passion. Whether it has loved, whether it
still loves, are points which I regard not. The love of which another is the object, charms me almost more than
that which is directed to myself. I see the strength, the force of a tender soul, and my self−love does not trouble
the delightful vision."
"Have you talked with Lydia, then, of late?" inquired Natalia.
Jarno smiled and nodded: Natalia shook her head, and said as he rose: "I really know not what to make of you; but
me you shall not mystify, I promise you."
She was about retiring, when the Abbé entered with a letter in his hand. "Stay, if you please," said he to her: "I
have a proposal here, respecting which your counsel will be welcome. The Marchese, your late uncle's friend,
Chapter VII

270

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
whom for some time we have been expecting, will be here in a day or two. He writes to me, that German is not so
familiar to him as he had supposed; that he needs a person who possesses this and other languages to travel with
him; that as he wishes to connect himself with scientific rather than political society, he cannot do without some
such interpreter. I can think of no one better suited for the post than our young friend here. He knows the
language; is acquainted with many things beside; and for himself, it cannot but be advantageous to travel over
Germany in such society and such circumstances. Till we have seen our native country, we have no scale to judge
of other countries by. What say you, my friend? What say you, Natalia?"
Nobody objected to the scheme: Jarno seemed to think his Transatlantic project would not be a hindrance, as he
did not mean to sail directly. Natalia did not speak; and Friedrich uttered various saws about the uses of travel.
This new project so provoked our friend, that he could hardly conceal his irritation. He saw, in this proposal, a
concerted plan for getting rid of him as soon as possible; and what was worse, they went so openly to work, and
seemed so utterly regardless of his feelings. The suspicions Lydia had excited in him, all that he himself had
witnessed, rose again upon his mind; the simple manner in which everything had been explained by Jarno, now
appeared to him another piece of artifice.
He constrained himself, and answered: "At all events, the offer will require mature deliberation."
"A quick decision may perhaps be necessary," said the Abbé.
"For that I am not prepared," answered Wilhelm. "We can wait till the Marchese comes, and then observe if we
agree together. One condition must, however, be conceded first of all; that I take Felix with me."
"This is a condition," said the Abbé, "which will scarcely be conceded."
"And I do not see," cried Wilhelm, "why I should let any man prescribe conditions to me; or why, if I choose to
view my native country, I must go in company with an Italian."
"Because a young man," said the Abbé, with a certain imposing earnestness, "is always called upon to form
connexions."
Wilhelm, feeling that he could not long retain his self−command, as it was Natalia's presence only which in some
degree assuaged his indignation, hastily made answer: "Give me a little while to think. I imagine it will not be
very hard to settle whether I am called upon to form additional connexions; or ordered irresistibly, by heart and
head, to free myself from such a multiplicity of bonds, which seem to threaten me with a perpetual, miserable
thraldom."
Thus he spoke, with a deeply−agitated mind. A glance at Natalia somewhat calmed him: her form and dignity, in
this impassioned moment, stamped themselves more deeply on his mind than ever.
"Yes," said he, so soon as he was by himself, "confess it, thou lovest her; thou once more feelest what it means to
love with thy whole soul. Thus did I love Mariana, and deceive myself so dreadfully; I loved Philina, and could
not help despising her. Aurelia I respected, and could not love; Theresa I reverenced, and paternal tenderness
assumed the form of an affection for her. And now when all the feelings that can make a mortal happy meet
within my heart, now am I compelled to fly! Ah! why should these feelings and convictions be combined with an
insuperable longing? Why, without the hope of its fulfillment, should they utterly subvert all other happiness?
Shall the sun and the world, society or any other gift of fortune, ever henceforth yield me pleasure? Shalt thou not
for ever say: Natalia is not here! And yet, alas, Natalia will be always present to thee! If thou closest thy eyes, she
will appear to thee; if thou openest them, her form will flit before all outward things, like the image which a
dazzling object leaves behind it in the eye. Did not the swiftly−passing figure of the Amazon dwell continually in
Chapter VII

271

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
thy imagination? And yet thou hadst but seen her, thou didst not know her. Now, when thou knowest her, when
thou hast been so long beside her, when she has shown such care about thee; now are her qualities impressed as
deeply upon thy soul, as her form was then upon thy fancy. It is painful to be always seeking; but far more painful
to have found, and to be forced to leave. What now shall I look for farther? Is there a country, a city that contains
a treasure such as this? And I must travel on, and ever find inferiority? Is life, then, like a race−course, where a
man must rapidly return, when he has reached the utmost end? Does the good, the excellent stand before us like a
firm unmoving goal, from which with fleet horses we are forced away, the instant we appeared to have attained it?
Happier are they who strive for earthly wares! They find what they are seeking in its proper climate, or they buy it
in the fair.
"Come, my own boy!" cried he to Felix, who now ran frisking towards him: "be thou, and remain thou, all to me!
Thou wert given me as a compensation for thy loved mother; thou wert to replace the second mother whom I
meant for thee; and now thou hast a loss still greater to make good. Occupy my heart, occupy my spirit with thy
beauty, thy loveliness, thy capabilities, and thy desire to use them!"
The boy was busied with a new plaything; his father tried to put it in a better state for him; just as he succeeded,
Felix had lost all pleasure in it. "Thou art a true son of Adam!" cried Wilhelm "Come, my child! Come, my
brother! let us wander, playing without object, through the world, as we best may."
His resolution to remove, to take the boy along with him, and recreate his mind by looking at the world, had now
assumed a settled form. He wrote to Werner for the necessary cash and letters of credit; sending Friedrich's
courier on the message, with the strictest charges to return immediately. Much as the conduct of his other friends
had grieved him, his relation to Natalia remained serene and clear as ever.
He confided to her his intention: she took it as a settled thing that he would go; and if this seeming carelessness in
her chagrined him, her kindly manner and her presence made him calm. She counselled him to visit various
towns, that he might get acquainted with certain of her friends. The courier returned, and brought the letter which
our friend required, though Werner did not seem content with this new whim. "My hope that thou wert growing
reasonable," so the letter ran, "is now again deferred. Where are you all gadding? And where lingers the lady,
who, thou saidst, was to assist us in arranging these affairs? Thy other friends also are absent: they have thrown
the whole concern upon the shoulders of the Lawyer and myself. Happy that he is as expert a jurist, as I am a
financier; and that both of us are used to business. Fare thee well! Thy aberrations shall be pardoned thee; since
but for them, our situation here could not have been so favourable."
So far as outward matters were concerned, Wilhelm might now have entered on his journey; but there were still,
for his heart, two hindrances that held him fast. In the first place, they flatly refused to show him Mignon's body,
till the funeral the Abbé meant to celebrate; and for this solemnity, the preparations were not ready. There had
also been a curious letter from the country Clergyman, in consequence of which the Doctor had gone off. It
related to the Harper; of whose fate Wilhelm wanted to have farther information.
In these circumstances, day or night he found no rest for mind or body. When all were asleep, he wandered up and
down the house. The presence of the pictures and statues, which he knew so well of old, alternately attracted and
repelled him. Nothing that surrounded him could he lay hold of or let go; all things reminded him of all; the whole
ring of his existence lay before him; but it was broken into fragments, and seemed as if it would never unite again.
These works of art, which his father had sold, appeared to him an omen that he himself was destined never to
obtain a lasting calm possession of anything desirable in life, or always to be robbed of it so soon as gained, by
his own or other people's blame. He waded so deep in these strange and dreary meditations, that often he almost
thought himself a disembodied spirit; and even when he felt and handled things without him, he could scarcely
keep himself from doubting whether he was really there and alive.

Chapter VII

272

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Nothing but the piercing grief, which often seized him, but the tears he shed at being forced, by causes frivolous
as they were irresistible, to leave the good which he had found, and found after having lost it,−restored him to the
feeling of his earthly life. It was in vain to call before his mind his happy state in other respects. "All is nothing,
then," exclaimed he, "if the one blessing, which appears to us worth all the rest, is wanting!"
The Abbé told the company that the Marchese was arrived. "You have determined, it appears," said he to
Wilhelm, "to set out upon your travels with your boy alone. Get acquainted with this nobleman, however; he will
be useful to you, if you meet him by the way." The Marchese entered: he was a person not yet very far advanced
in years; a fine, handsome, pleasing Lombard figure. In his youth, while in the army and afterwards in public
business, he had known Lothario's uncle; they had subsequently travelled through the greater part of Italy
together; and many of the works of art, which the Marchese now again fell in with, had been purchased in his
presence, and under various happy circumstances, which he still distinctly recollected.
The Italians have in general a deeper feeling for the high dignity of art than any other nation. In Italy, whoever
follows the employment, tries to pass at once for artist, master and professor: by which pretensions, he
acknowledges at least that it is not sufficient merely to lay hold of some transmitted excellency, or to acquire by
practice some dexterity; but that a man who aims at art, should have the power to think of what he does, to lay
down principles, and make apparent to himself and others how and wherefore he proceeds in this way or in that.
The stranger was affected at again beholding these productions, when the owner of them was no more; and
cheered to see the spirit of his friend surviving in the gifted persons left behind him.
They discussed a series of works; they found a lively satisfaction in the harmony of their ideas. The Marchese and
the Abbé were the speakers; Natalia felt herself again transported to the presence of her uncle, and could enter
without difficulty into their opinions and criticisms; Wilhelm could not understand them, except as he translated
their technology into dramatic language. Friedrich's facetious vein was sometimes rather difficult to keep in
check. Jarno was seldom there.
It being observed that excellent works of art were very rare in latter times, it was remarked by the Marchese: "We
can hardly think or estimate how many circumstances must combine in favour of the artist: with the greatest
genius, with the most decisive talent, the demands which he must make upon himself are infinite, the diligence
required in cultivating his endowments is unspeakable. Now, if circumstances are not in his favour; if he observed
that the world is very easy to be satisfied, requiring but a slight, pleasing. transitory show; it were matter of
surprise, if indolence and selfishness did not keep him fixed at mediocrity; it were strange if he did not rather
think of bartering modish wares for gold and praises, than of entering on the proper path, which could not fail in
some degree to lead him to a sort of painful martyrdom. Accordingly, the artists of our time are always offering
and never giving. They always aim at charming, and they never satisfy: everything is merely indicated; you can
nowhere find foundation or completion. Those for whom they labour, it is true, are little better. If you wait a while
in any gallery of pictures, and observe what works attract the many, what are praised and what neglected, you
have little pleasure in the present, little hope in the future."
"Yes," replied the Abbé "and thus it is that artists and their judges mutually form each other. The latter ask for
nothing but a general vague enjoyment, a work of art is to delight them almost as a work of nature; they imagine
that the organs for enjoying works of art may be cultivated altogether of themselves, like the tongue and the
palate; they try a picture or a poem as they do an article of food. They do not understand how very different a
species of culture it requires to raise one to the true enjoyment of art. The hardest part of it, in my opinion, is that
sort of separation, which a man that aims at perfect culture must accomplish in himself. It is on this account that
we observe so many people partially cultivated; and yet every one of them attempting to pronounce upon the
general whole."
"Your last remark is not quite clear to me," said Jarno, who came in just then.

"It would be difficult," replied the Abbé "to explain it fully without a long detail. Thus much I may say: When any
man pretends to mix in manifold activity or manifold enjoyment, he must also be enabled as it were to make his
organs manifold and independent of each other. Whoever aims at doing or enjoying all and everything with his
entire nature; whoever tries to link together all that is without him by such a species of enjoyment, will only lose
his time in efforts that can never be successful. How difficult, though it seems so easy, is it to contemplate a noble
disposition, a fine picture simply in and for itself; to watch the music for the music's sake; to admire the actor in
the actor; to take pleasure in a building for its own peculiar harmony and durability! Most men are wont to treat a
work of art, though fixed and done, as if it were a piece of soft clay. The hard and polished marble is again to
mould itself, the firm−walled edifice is contract or to expand itself, according as their inclinations, sentiments and
whims may dictate; the picture is to be instructive, the play to make us better, everything is to do all. The reason
is, that most men are themselves unformed, they cannot give themselves and their being any certain shape: and
thus they strive to take from other things their proper shape, that all they have to do with may be loose and
wavering like themselves. Everything is, in the long−run, reduced by them to what they call effect; everything is
relative, say they; and so indeed it is; everything with them grows relative, except absurdity and platitude, which
truly are absolute enough."
"I understand you," answered Jarno; "or rather I perceive how what you have been saying follows from the
principles you hold so fast by. Yet with men, poor devils, we should not go to quest so strictly. I know enow of
them in truth, who, beside the greatest works of art and nature, forthwith recollect their own most paltry
insufficiency; who take their conscience and their morals with them to the opera; who bethink them of their loves
and hatreds in contemplating a colonnade. The best and greatest that can be presented to them from without, they
must first, as far as possible, diminish in their way of representing it, that they may in any measure be enabled to
combine it with their own sorry nature."

Chapter VIII
THE ABBÉ called them, in the evening, to attend the exequies of Mignon. The company proceeded to the Hall of
the Past; they found it magnificently ornamented and illuminated. The walls were hung with azure tapestry almost
from ceiling to floor, so that nothing but the friezes and socles, above and below, were visible. On the four
candelabra in the corners, large wax−lights were burning; smaller lights were in the four smaller candelabra
placed by the sarcophagus in the middle. Near this stood four Boys, dressed in azure with silver; they had broad
fans of ostrich feathers, which they waved above a figure that was resting upon the sarcophagus. The company sat
down: two invisible Choruses began in a soft musical recitative to ask: "Whom bring ye us to the still dwelling?"
The four Boys replied with lovely voices: "Tis a tired playmate whom we bring you; let her rest in your still
dwelling, till the songs of her heavenly sisters once more awaken her."
CHORUSFirstling of youth in our circle, we welcome thee! With sadness welcome thee! May no boy, no maiden
follow! Let age only, willing and composed, approach the silent Hall, and in the solemn company, repose this one
dear child!
BOYSAh, reluctantly we brought her hither! Ah, and she is to remain here! Let us too remain; let us weep, let us
weep upon her bier!
CHORUSYet look at the strong wings; look at the light clear robe! How glitters the golden band upon her head!
Look at the beautiful, the noble repose!
BOYSAh! the wings do not raise her; in the frolic game, her robe flutters to and fro no more; when we bound her
head with roses, her looks on us were kind and friendly.
CHORUSCast forward the eye of the spirit! Awake in your souls the imaginative power, which carries forth, what
Chapter VIII

is fairest, what is highest, Life, away beyond the stars.
BOYSBut ah! we find her not here; in the garden she wanders not; the flowers of the meadow she plucks no
longer. Let us weep, we are leaving her here! Let us weep and remain with her!
CHORUSChildren, turn back into life! Your tears let the fresh air dry, which plays upon the rushing water. Fly
from Night! Day and Pleasure and Continuance are the lot of the living.
BOYSUp! Turn back into life! Let the day give us labour and pleasure, till the evening brings us rest, and the
nightly sleep refreshes us.
CHORUSChildren! Hasten into life! In the pure garments of beauty, may Love meet you with heavenly looks and
with the wreath of immortality!
The Boys had retired; the Abbé rose from his seat, and went behind the bier. "It is the appointment," said he, "of
the Man who prepared this silent abode, that each new tenant of it shall be introduced with a solemnity. After him,
the builder of this mansion, the founder of this establishment, we have next brought a young stranger hither: and
thus already does this little space contain two altogether different victims of the rigorous, arbitrary, and inexorable
Death−goddess. By appointed laws we enter into life; the days are numbered which make us ripe to see the light;
but for the duration of our life there is no law. The weakest thread will spin itself to unexpected length; and the
strongest is cut suddenly asunder by the scissors of the Fates, delighting, as it seems, in contradictions. Of the
child, whom we have here committed to her final rest, we can say but little. It is still uncertain whence she came;
her parents we know not; the years of her life we can only conjecture. Her deep and closely−shrouded soul
allowed us scarce to guess at its interior movements: there was nothing clear in her, nothing open but her affection
for the man, who had snatched her from the hands of a barbarian. This impassioned tenderness, this vivid
gratitude, appeared to be the flame which consumed the oil of her life: the skill of the physician could not save
that fair life, the most anxious friendship could not lengthen it. But if art could not stay the departing spirit, it has
done its utmost to preserve the body, and withdraw it from decay. A balsamic substance has been forced through
all the veins, and now tinges, in place of blood, these cheeks too early faded. Come near, my friends, and view
this wonder of art and care!"
He raised the veil: the child was lying in her angel's−dress, as if asleep, in the most soft and graceful posture.
They approached, and admired this show of life. Wilhelm alone continued sitting in his place: he was not able to
compose himself: what he felt, he durst not think; and every thought seemed ready to destroy his feeling.
For the sake of the Marchese, the speech had been pronounced in French. That nobleman came forward with the
rest, and viewed the figure with attention. The Abbé thus proceeded: "With a holy confidence, this kind heart,
shut up to men, was continually turned to its God. Humility, nay an inclination to abase herself externally, seemed
natural to her. She clave with zeal to the Catholic religion, in which she had been born and educated. Often she
expressed a still wish to sleep on consecrated ground: and according to the usage of the church, we have therefore
consecrated this marble coffin, and the little earth which is hidden in the cushion that supports her head. With
what ardour did she in her last moments kiss the image of the Crucified, which stood beautifully figured on her
tender arm, with many hundred points!" So saying, he stripped up her right sleeve, and a crucifix, with marks and
letters round it, showed itself in blue upon the white skin.
The Marchese looked at this with eagerness, stooping down to view it more intensely. "O God!" cried he, as he
stood upright, and raised his hands to Heaven: "Poor child! Unhappy niece! Do I meet thee here! What a painful
joy to find thee, whom we had long lost hope of; to find this dear frame, which we had long believed the prey of
fishes in the ocean, here preserved, though lifeless! I assist at thy funeral, splendid in its external circumstances,
still more splendid from the noble persons who attend thee to thy place of rest. And to these," added he with a
faltering voice, "so soon as I can speak, I will express my thanks."
Chapter VIII

275

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Tears hindered him from saying more. By the pressure of a spring, the Abbé sank the body into the cavity of the
marble. Four Youths, dressed as the Boys had been, came out from behind the tapestry; and lifting the heavy,
beautifully ornamented lid upon the coffin, thus began their song:
THE YOUTHSWell is the treasure now laid up; the fair image of the Past! Here sleeps it in the marble,
undecaying; in your hearts too it lives, it works. Travel, travel, back into life! Take along with you this holy
Earnestness;−for Earnestness alone makes life eternity.
The invisible Chorus joined in with the last words: but no one heard the strengthening sentiment; all were too
much busied with themselves, and the emotions which these wonderful disclosures had excited. The Abbé and
Natalia conducted the Marchese out; Theresa and Lothario walked by Wilhelm. It was not till the music had
altogether died away, that their sorrows, thoughts, meditations, curiosity again fell on them with all their force,
and made them long to be transported back into that exalting scene.

Chapter IX
THE MARCHESE avoided speaking of the matter; but had long secret conversations with the Abbé. When the
Company was met, he often asked for music; a request to which they willingly assented, as each was glad to be
delivered from the charge of talking. Thus they lived for some time, till it was observed that he was making
preparations for departure. One day he said to Wilhelm: "I wish not to disturb the remains of this beloved child;
let her rest in the place where she loved and suffered: but her friends must promise to visit me in her native
country; in the scene where she was born and bred; they must see the pillars and statues, of which a dim idea
remained with her. I will lead you to the bays, where she liked so well to roam and gather pebbles. You, at least,
young friend, shall not escape the gratitude of a family that stands so deeply indebted to you. Tomorrow I set out
on my journey. The Abbé is acquainted with the whole history of this matter: he will tell it you again. He could
pardon me when grief interrupted my recital; as a third party he will be enabled to narrate the incidents with more
connexion. If, as the Abbé had proposed, you like to follow me in travelling over Germany, you shall be heartily
welcome. Leave not your boy behind: at every little inconvenience which he causes us, we will again remember
your attentive care of my poor niece."
The same evening, our party was surprised by the arrival of the Countess. Wilhelm trembled in every joint as she
entered: she herself, though forewarned, kept close by her sister, who speedily reached her a chair. How
singularly simple was her attire, how altered was her form; Wilhelm scarcely dared to look at her: she saluted him
with a kindly air; a few general words addressed to him did not conceal her sentiments and feelings. The
Marchese had retired betimes; and as the company were not disposed to part so early, the Abbé now produced a
manuscript. "The singular narrative which was intrusted to me," said he, "I forthwith put on paper. The case
where pen and ink should least of all be spared, is in recording the particular circumstances of remarkable events."
They informed the Countess of the matter; and the Abbé read as follows, in the name of the Marchese: "Many
men as I have seen, I still regard my father as a very extraordinary person. His character was noble and upright;
his ideas were enlarged, I may even say great; to himself he was severe; in all his plans there was a rigid order, in
all his operations an unbroken perseverance. In one sense, therefore, it was easy to transact and live with him: yet
owing to the very qualities which made it so, he never could accommodate himself to life; for he required from
the state, from his neighbours, from his children and his servants, the observance of all the laws which he had laid
upon himself. His most moderate demands became exorbitant by his rigour: and he never could attain to
enjoyment, for nothing ever was completed as he had forecast it. At the moment when he was erecting a palace,
laying out a garden, or acquiring a large estate in the highest cultivations, I have seen him inwardly convinced,
with the sternest ire, that Fate had doomed him to do nothing but abstain and suffer. In his exterior, he maintained
the greatest dignity; if he jested, it was but displaying the preponderancy of his understanding. Censure was
intolerable to him; the only time I ever saw him quite transported with rage, was once when he heard that one of
his establishments was spoken of as something ludicrous. In the same spirit, he had settled the disposal of his
Chapter IX

276

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
children and his fortune. My eldest brother was educated as a person that had large estates to look for. I was to
embrace the clerical profession; the youngest was to be a soldier. I was of a lively temper; fiery, active, quick, apt
for corporeal exercises: the youngest rather seemed inclined to an enthusiastic quietism; devoted to the sciences,
to music and poetry. It was not till after the hardest struggle, the maturest conviction of the impossibility of his
project, that our father, still reluctantly, agreed to let us change vocations; and although he saw us both contented,
he could never suit himself to this arrangement, but declared that nothing good would come of it. The older he
grew, the more isolated did he feel himself from all society. At last he came to live almost entirely alone. One old
friend, who had served in the German armies, who had lost his wife in the campaign, and brought a daughter of
about ten years of age along with him, remained his only visitor. This person bought a fine little property beside
us: he used to come and see my father on stated days of the week, and at stated hours; his little daughter often
came along with him. He was never heard to contradict my father; who at length grew perfectly habituated to him,
and endured him as the only tolerable company he had. After our father's death, we easily observed that this old
gentleman had not been visiting for naught, that his compliances had been rewarded by an ample settlement. He
enlarged his estates; his daughter might expect a handsome portion. The girl grew up, and was extremely
beautiful: my elder brother often joked with me about her, saying I should go and court her. "Meanwhile brother
Augustin, in the seclusion of his cloister, had been spending his years in the strangest state of mind. He
abandoned himself wholly to the feeling of a holy enthusiasm, to those half−spiritual, half−physical, emotions,
which, as they for a time exalted him to the third heaven, ere long sank him down to an abyss of powerlessness
and vacant misery. While my father lived, no change could be contemplated: what indeed could we have asked
for or proposed? After the old man's death, our brother visited us frequently: his situation, which at first afflicted
us, in time became much more tolerable: for his reason had at length prevailed. But the more confidently reason
promised him complete recovery and contentment on the pure part of nature, the more vehemently did he require
of us to free him from his vows. His thoughts, he let us know, were turned upon Sperata, our fair neighbour. "My
elder brother had experienced too much suffering from the harshness of our father, to look on the condition of the
youngest without sympathy. We spoke with the family confessor, a worthy old man; we signified to him the
double purpose of our brother, and requested him to introduce and expedite the business. Contrary to custom, he
delayed: and at last, when Augustin pressed us, and we recommended the affair more keenly to the clergyman, he
had nothing left but to impart the strange secret to us. "Sperata was our sister, and that by both her parents. Our
mother had declared herself with child at a time when both she and our father were advanced in years; a similar
occurrence had shortly before been made the subject of some merriment in our neighbourhood; and our father, to
avoid such ridicule, determined to conceal this late lawful fruit of love as carefully as people use to conceal its
earlier accidental fruits. Our mother was delivered secretly; the child was carried to the country; and the old friend
of the family, who, with the confessor, had alone been trusted with the secret, easily engaged to give her out for
his daughter. The confessor had reserved the right of disclosing the secret in case of extremity. The supposed
father was now dead; Sperata was living with an old lady; we were aware that a love of song and music had
already led our brother to her; and on his again requiring us to undo his former bond, that he might engage
himself by a new one, it was necessary that we should, as soon as possible, apprise him of the danger he stood in.
"He viewed us with a wild contemptuous look. 'Spare your idle tales,' cried he, 'for children and credulous fools;
from me, from my heart, they shall not tear Sperata; she is mine. Recall, I pray you, instantly, your frightful
spectre, which would but harass me in vain. Sperata is not my sister; she is my wife!' He described to us, in
rapturous terms, how this heavenly girl had drawn him out of his unnatural state of separation from his
fellow−creatures into true life; how their spirits accorded like their voices; how he blessed his sufferings and
errors, since they had kept clear of women, till the moment when he wholly and forever gave himself to this most
amiable being. We were shocked at the discovery, we deplored his situation, but we knew not how to help
ourselves, for he declared with violence, that Sperata had a child by him within her bosom. Our confessor did
whatever duty could suggest to him, but by this means he only made the evil worse. The relations of nature and
religion, moral rights and civil laws, were vehemently attacked and spurned at by our brother. He considered
nothing holy but his relation Sperata; nothing dignified but the names of father and wife. 'These alone,' cried he,
'are suitable to nature; all else is caprice and opinion. Were there not noble nations which admitted marriage with
a sister? Name not your gods! You never name them but when you wish to befool us, to lead us from the paths of
nature, and, by scandalous constraint, to transform the noblest inclinations into crimes. Unspeakable are the
Chapter IX

277

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
perplexities, abominable the abuses, into which you force the victims whom you bury alive. "'I may speak, for I
have suffered like no other; from the highest, sweetest feeling of enthusiasm, to the frightful deserts of utter
powerlessness, vacancy, annihilation and despair; from the loftiest aspirations of preternatural existence, to the
most entire unbelief, unbelief in myself. All these horrid grounds of the cup, so flattering at the brim, I have
drained; and my whole being was poisoned to its core. And now, when kind Nature, by her greatest gift, by love,
has healed me; now, when in the arms of a heavenly creature, I again feel that I am, that she is, that out of this
living union a third shall arise and smile in our faces; now ye open up the flames of your Hell, of your Purgatory,
which can only singe a sick imagination; ye oppose them to the vivid, true, indestructible enjoyment of pure love!
Meet us under these cypresses, which turn their solemn tops to heaven; visit us among those espaliers where the
citrons and pomegranates bloom beside us, where the graceful myrtle stretches out its tender flowers to us; and
then venture to disturb us with your dreary, paltry nets which men have spun!' "Thus for a long time he persisted
in a stubborn disbelief of our story; and when we assured him of its truth, when the confessor himself asseverated
it, he did not let it drive him from his point. 'Ask not the echoes of your cloisters, not your mouldering
parchments, not your narrow whims and ordinances! Ask Nature and your heart; she will teach you what you
should recoil from; she will point out to you with the strictest finger, over what she has pronounced her
everlasting curse. Look at the lilies: do not husband and wife shoot forth on the same stalk. Does not the flower,
which bore them, hold them both? And is not the lily the type of innocence; is not their sisterly union fruitful?
When Nature abhors, she speaks it aloud; the creature that shall not be is not produced; the creature that lives with
a false life is soon destroyed. Unfruitfulness, painful existence, early destruction, these are her curses, the marks
of her displeasure. It is only by immediate consequences that she punishes. Look around you; and what is
prohibited, what is accursed, will force itself upon your notice. In the silence of the convent, in the tumult of the
world, a thousand practices are consecrated and revered, while her curse rests on them. On stagnant idleness as on
overstrained toil, on caprice and superfluity as on constraint and want, she looks down with mournful eyes: her
call is to moderation; true are all her commandments, peaceful all her influences. The man who has suffered as I
have done has a right to be free. Sperata is mine; death alone shall take her from me. How I shall retain her, how I
may be happy, these are your cares! This instant I go to her, and part from her no more.' "He was for proceeding
to the boat, and crossing over to her: we restrained him entreating that he would not take a step, which might
produce the most tremendous consequences. He should recollect, we told him, that he was not living in the free
world of his own thoughts and ideas; but in a constitution of affairs, whose ordinances and relations had become
inflexible as laws of nature. The confessor made us promise not to let him leave our sight, still less our house:
after this he went away, engaging to return ere long. What we had foreseen took place: reason had made our
brother strong, but his heart was weak; the earlier impressions of religion rose on him, and dreadful doubts along
with them. He passed two fearful nights and days: the confessor came again to his assistance, but in vain! His
enfranchised understanding acquitted him: his feelings, religion, all his usual ideas declared him guilty. "One
morning we found his chamber empty: on the table lay a note, in which he signified that, as we kept him prisoner
by force, he felt himself entitled to provide for his freedom; that he meant to go directly to Sperata; he expected to
escape with her, and was prepared for the most terrible extremities, should any separation by attempted. "The
news of course affrighted us exceedingly; but the confessor bade us be at rest. Our poor brother had been
narrowly enough observed: the boatman, in place of taking him across, proceeded with him to his cloister.
Fatigued with watching for the space of four−and−twenty hours, he fell asleep, as the skiff began to rock him in
the moonshine; and he did not awake, till he saw himself in the hands of his spiritual brethren; he did not recover
from his amazement, till he heard the doors of the convent bolting behind him. "Sharply touched at the fate of our
brother, we reproached the confessor for his cruelty; but he soon silenced or convinced us by the surgeon's reason,
that our pity was destructive to the patient. He let us know that he was not acting on his own authority, but by
order of the bishop and his chapter; that by this proceeding, they intended to avoid all public scandal, and to
shroud the sad occurrence under the veil of a secret course of discipline prescribed by the Church. Our sister they
would spare; she was not to be told that her lover was her brother. The charge of her was given to a priest, to
whom she had before disclosed her situation. They contrived to hide her pregnancy and her delivery. As a mother
she felt altogether happy in her little one. Like most of our women, she could neither write, nor read writing: she
gave the priest many verbal messages to carry to her lover. The latter, thinking that he owed this pious fraud to a
suckling mother, often brought pretended tidings from our brother, whom he never saw; recommending her, in his
Chapter IX

278

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
name, to be at peace; begging of her to be careful of herself and of her child; and for the rest to trust in God.
"Sperata was inclined by nature to religious feelings. Her situation, her solitude increased this tendency; the
clergyman encouraged it, in order to prepare her by degrees for an eternal separation. Scarcely was her child
weaned, scarcely did he think her body strong enough for suffering agony of mind, when he began to paint her
fault to her in most terrific colours, to treat the crime of being connected with a priest as a sort of sin against
nature, as a sort of incest. For he had taken up the strange thought of making her repentance equal in intensity to
what it would have been, had she known the true circumstances of her error. He thereby produced so much
anxiety and sorrow in her mind; he so exalted the idea of the Church and of its head before her; showed her the
awful consequences, for the weal of all men's souls, should indulgence in a case like this be granted, and the
guilty pair rewarded by a lawful union; signifying too how wholesome it was to expiate such sins in time, and
thereby gain the crown of immortality−that at last, like a poor criminal, she willingly held out her neck to the axe,
and earnestly entreated that she might forever be divided from our brother. Having gained so much, the clergy left
her the liberty (reserving to themselves a certain distant oversight) to live at one time in a convent, at another in
her house, according as she afterwards thought good. "Her little girl meanwhile was growing: from her earliest
years, she had displayed an extraordinary disposition. When still very young, she could run, and move with
wonderful dexterity: she sang beautifully, and learned to play upon the cithern almost of herself. With words,
however, she could not express herself; and the impediment seemed rather to proceed from her mode of thought,
than from her organs of speech. The feelings of the poor mother to her, in the mean time, were of the most painful
kind: the expostulations of the priest had so perplexed her mind, that though she was not quite deranged, her state
was far from being sane. She daily thought her crime more terrible and punishable; the clergyman's comparison of
incest, frequently repeated, had impressed itself so deeply, that her horror was not less than if the actual
circumstances had been known to her. The priest took no small credit for his ingenuity, with which he had
contrived to tear asunder a luckless creature's heart. It was miserable to behold maternal love, ready to expand
itself in joy at the existence of her child, contending with the horrid feeling, that this child should not be there.
The two emotions strove together in her soul; love was often weaker than aversion. "The child had long ago been
taken from her, and committed to a worthy family residing on the sea−shore. In the greater freedom, which the
little creature enjoyed here, she soon displayed her singular delight in climbing. To mount the highest peaks, to
run long the edges of the ships, to imitate in all their strangest feats the rope−dancers, whom she often saw in the
place, seemed a natural tendency in her. "To practise these things with the greater ease, she liked to change
clothes with boys: and though her foster parents thought this highly blameable and unbecoming, we bade them
indulge her as much as possible. Her wild walks and leapings often led her to a distance; she would lose her way,
and be long from home, but she always came back. In general, as she returned, she used to set herself beneath the
columns in the portal of a country house in the neighbourhood: her people now had ceased to look for her; they
waited for her. She would there lie resting on the steps: then run up and down the large hall, looking at the statues;
after which, if nothing specially detained her, she used to hasten home. "But at last our confidence was balked,
and our indulgence punished. The child went out, and did not come again: her little hat was found swimming on
the water, near the spot where a torrent rushed down into the sea. It was conjectured that, in clambering among
the rocks, her foot had slipped; all our searching could not find the body. "The thoughtless tattle of her
house−mates soon communicated the occurrence to Sperata; she seemed calm and cheerful when she heard it;
hinting not obscurely at her satisfaction that God had pleased to take her poor little child to himself, and thus
preserved it from suffering or causing some more dreadful misery. "On this occasion, all the fables which are told
about our waters came to be the common talk. The sea, it was said, required every year an innocent child: yet it
would endure no corpse, but sooner or later throw it to the shore; nay the last joint, though sunk to the lowest
bottom, must again come forth. They told the story of a mother, inconsolable because her child had perished in
the sea, who prayed to God and his saints to grant her at least the bones for burial. The first storm threw ashore
the skull, the next the spine; and after all was gathered, she wrapped the bones in a cloth, and took them to the
church: but O! miraculous to tell! as she crossed the threshold of the temple, the packet grew heavier and heavier,
and at last, when she laid it on the steps of the altar, the child began to cry and issued living from the cloth. One
joint of the right−hand little finger was alone wanting: this too the mother anxiously sought and found; and in
memory of the event it was preserved among the other relics of the church. "On poor Sperata these recitals made a
deep impression: her imagination took a new flight, and favoured the emotion of her heart. She supposed that now
Chapter IX

279

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
the child had expiated, by its death, both its own sins, and the sins of its parents: that the curse and penalty, which
hitherto had overhung them all, was at length wholly removed; that nothing more was necessary, could she only
find the child's bones, that she might carry them to Rome, where upon the steps of the great altar in St. Peter's, her
little girl, again covered with its fair fresh skin, would stand up alive before the people. With its own eyes it
would once more look on father and mother; and the Pope, convinced that God and his saints commanded it,
would, amid the acclamations of the people, remit the parents their sins, acquit them of their oaths, and join their
hands in wedlock. "Her looks and her anxiety were henceforth constantly directed to the sea and the beach. When,
at night in the moonshine, the waves were tossing to and fro, she thought every glittering sheet of foam was
bringing out her child; and some one about her had to run off, as if to take it up when it should reach the shore.
"By day she walked unweariedly along the places where the pebbly beach shelved slowly to the water: she
gathered, in a little basket, all the bones which she could find. None durst tell her that they were the bones of
animals: the larger ones she buried, the little ones she took along with her. In this employment she incessantly
persisted. The clergyman, who, by so unremittingly discharging what he thought his duty, had reduced her to this
condition, now stood up for her with all his might. By his influence, the people in the neighbourhood were made
to look upon her not as a distracted person, but as one entranced: they stood in reverent attitudes as she walked by,
and the children ran to kiss her hand. "To the old woman, her attendant and faithful friend, the secret of Sperata's
guilt was at length imparted by the priest, on her solemnly engaging to watch over the unhappy creature with
untiring care, through all her life. And she kept this engagement to the last, with admirable conscientiousness and
patience. "Meanwhile we had always had an eye upon our brother. Neither the physicians nor the clergy of his
convent would allow us to be seen by him: but, in order to convince us of his being well in some sort, we had
leave to look at him as often as we liked, in the garden, the passages, or even through a window in the roof of his
apartment. "After many terrible and singular changes, which I shall omit, he had passed into a strange state of
mental rest and bodily unrest. He never sat but when he took his harp and played upon it, and then he usually
accompanied it with singing. At other times, he kept continually in motion; and in all things he was grown
extremely guidable and pliant, for all his passions seemed to have resolved themselves into the single fear of
death. You could persuade him to do anything, by threatening him with dangerous sickness or with death.
"Besides this singularity of walking constantly about the cloister, a practice which he hinted it were better to
exchange for wandering over hill and dale, he talked about an Apparition which perpetually tormented him. He
declared, that on awakening, at whatever hour of the night, he saw a beautiful boy standing at the foot of his bed,
with a bare knife, and threatening to destroy him. They shifted him to various other chambers of the convent; but
he still asserted that the boy pursued him. His wandering to and from became more unrestful: the people
afterwards remembered too, that at this time they had often seen him standing at the window looking out upon the
sea. "Our poor sister, on the other hand, seemed gradually wasting under the consuming influence of her single
thought, of her narrow occupation. It was at last proposed by the physician, that among the bones which she had
gathered, the fragments of a child's skeleton should by degrees be introduced; and so the hapless mother's hopes
kept up. The experiment was dubious; but this at least seemed likely to be gained by it, that when all the parts
were got together, she would cease her weary search, and might be entertained with hopes of going to Rome. "It
was accordingly resolved on: her attendant changed, by imperceptible degrees, the small remains committed to
her with the bones Sperata found. An inconceivable delight arose in the poor sick woman's heart, when the parts
began to fit each other, and the shape of those still wanting could be marked. She had fastened every fragment in
its proper place with threads and ribbons; filling up the vacant spaces with embroidery and silk, as is usually done
with the relics of saints. "In this way nearly all the bones had been collected; none but a few of the extremities
were wanting. One morning, while she was asleep, the physician having come to ask for her, the old attendant,
with a view to show him how his patient occupied herself, took away these dear remains from the little chest
where they lay in poor Sperata's bedroom. A few minutes afterwards, they heard her spring upon the floor; she
lifted up the cloth and found the chest empty. She threw herself upon her knees; they came and listened to her
joyful ardent prayer. 'Yes!' exclaimed she, 'it is true; it was no dream, it is real! Rejoice with me, my friends! I
have seen my own beautiful good little girl again alive. She arose and threw the veil from off her; her splendour
enlightened all the room; her beauty was transfigured to celestial loveliness; she could not tread the ground,
although she wished it. Lightly was she born aloft; she had not even time to stretch her hand to me. There! cried
she to me, and pointed to the road where I am soon to go. Yes, I will follow her, soon follow her; my heart is light
Chapter IX

280

to think of it. My sorrows are already vanished; the sight of my risen little one has given me a foretaste of the
heavenly joys.' "From that time her soul was wholly occupied with prospects of the brightest kind: she gave no
farther heed to any earthly object; she took but little food; her spirit by degrees cast off the fetters of the body. At
last this imperceptible gradation reached its head unexpectedly: her attendants found her pale and motionless; she
opened not her eyes; she was what we call dead. "The report of her vision quickly spread abroad among the
people; and the reverential feeling, which she had excited in her lifetime, soon changed, at her death, to the
thought that she should be regarded as in bliss, nay as in sanctity. "When we were bearing her to be interred, a
crowd of persons pressed with boundless violence about the bier; they would touch her hand; they would touch
her garment. In this impassioned elevation, various sick persons ceased to feel the pains by which at other times
they were tormented: they looked upon themselves as healed; they declared it, they praised God and his new saint.
The clergy were obliged to lay the body in a neighbouring chapel; the people called for opportunity to offer their
devotion. The concourse was incredible; the mountaineers, at all times prone to lively and religious feelings,
crowded forward from their valleys; the reverence, the wonder, the adoration daily spread and gathered strength.
The ordinances of the bishop, which were meant to limit, and in time abolish this new worship, could not be put
in execution: every show of opposition raised the people into tumults; every unbeliever they were ready to assail
with personal violence. 'Did not Saint Borromaus,' cried they, 'dwell among our forefathers? Did not his mother
live to taste the joy of his canonisation? Was not that great figure on the rocks at Arona meant to represent to us,
by a sensible symbol, his spiritual greatness? Do not the descendants of his kindred live among us to this hour?
And has not God promised ever to renew his miracles among a people that believe?' "As the body, after several
days, exhibited no marks of putrefaction, but grew whiter, and as it were translucent, the general faith rose higher
and higher. Among the multitude were several cures, which even the sceptical observer was unable to account for,
or ascribe entirely to fraud. The whole country was in motion; those who did not go to see it, heard at least no
other topic talked of. "The convent, where my brother lived, resounded, like the land at large, with the noise of
these wonders; and the people felt the less restraint in speaking of them in his presence, as in general he seemed to
pay no heed to anything, and his connexion with the circumstance was known to none of them. But on this
occasion, it appeared, he had listened with attention. He conducted his escape with such dexterity and cunning,
that the manner of it still remains a mystery. We learned afterwards, that he had crossed the water with a number
of travellers; and charged the boatmen, who observed no other singularity about him, above all to have a care lest
their vessel overset. Late in the night, he reached the chapel, where his hapless loved one was resting from her
woes. Only a few devotees were kneeling in the corners of the place; her old friend was sitting at the head of the
corpse; he walked up to her, saluted her, and asked how her mistress was. 'You see it,' answered she with some
embarrassment. He looked at the corpse with a sidelong glance. After some delay he took its hand. Frightened by
its coldness, he in the instant let go: he looked unrestfully around him; then turning to the old attendant: 'I cannot
stay with her at present,' said he; 'I have a long, long way to travel; but at the proper time I shall be back: tell her
so when she awakens.' "With this he went away. It was a while before we got intelligence of these occurrences:
we searched: but all our efforts to discover him were vain. How he worked his way across the mountains, none
can say. A long time after he was gone, we came upon a trace of him among the Grisons; but we were too late; it
quickly vanished. We supposed that he was gone to Germany; but his weak foot−prints had been speedily
obliterated by the war."

Chapter X
THE ABBÉ ceased to read: no one had listened without tears. The Countess scarcely ever took her handkerchief
from her eyes; at last she rose, and, with Natalia, left the room. The rest were silent, till the Abbé thus began: "The
question now arises, whether we shall let the good Marchese leave us without telling him our secret. For who can
doubt a moment, that our Harper and his brother Augustin are one? Let us consider what is to be done; both for
the sake of that unhappy man himself, and of his family. My advice is, not to hurry, but to wait till we have heard
what news the Doctor, who is gone to see him, brings us back."
All were of the same opinion; and the Abbé thus proceeded: "Another question, which perhaps may be disposed
Chapter X

281

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
of sooner, still remains. The Marchese is affected to the bottom of his heart, at the kindness which his poor niece
experienced here, particularly from our young friend. He made me tell him, and repeat to him every circumstance
connected with her; and he showed the liveliest gratitude on hearing it. 'Her young benefactor,' he said, 'refused to
travel with me, while he knew not the connexion that subsists between us. I am not now a stranger, of whose
manner of existence, of whose humours he might be uncertain. I am his associate, his relation; and as his
unwillingness to leave his boy behind was the impediment which kept him from accompanying me, let this child
now become a fairer bond to join us still more closely. Besides the services which I already owe him, let him be
of service to me on my present journey: let him then return along with me; my elder brother will receive him as he
ought. And let him not despise the heritage of his unhappy foster−child: for by a secret stipulation of our father
with his military friend, the fortune which he gave Sperata has returned to us: and certainly we will not cheat our
niece's benefactor of the recompense which he has merited so well.'"
Theresa, taking Wilhelm by the hand, now said to him: "we have here another beautiful example that disinterested
well−doing yields the highest and best return. Follow the call, which so strangely comes to you: and while you lay
a double load of gratitude on the Marchese, hasten to a fair land, which has already often drawn your heart and
your imagination towards it."
"I leave myself entirely to the guidance of my friends and you," said Wilhelm: "it is vain to think, in this world, of
adhering to our individual will. What I purposed to hold fast, I must let go; and benefits which I have not
deserved, descend upon me of their own accord."
With a gentle pressure of Theresa's hand, Wilhelm took his own away. "I give you full permission," said he to the
Abbé "to decide about me as you please. Since I shall not need to leave my Felix, I am ready to go anywhither,
and to undertake whatever you think good."
Thus authorised, the Abbé forthwith sketched out his plan. The Marchese, he proposed, should be allowed to
depart; Wilhelm was to wait for tidings from the Doctor; he might then, when they had settled what was to be
done, set off with Felix. Accordingly, under the pretence that Wilhelm's preparations for his journey would detain
him, he advised the stranger to employ the mean while in examining the curiosities of the city, which he meant to
visit. The Marchese did in consequence depart; and not without renewed and strong expressions of his gratitude;
of which indeed the presents left by him, including jewels, precious stones, embroidered stuffs, afforded a
sufficient proof.
Wilhelm too was at length in readiness for travelling; and his friends began to be distressed that the Doctor sent
them no news. They feared some mischief had befallen the poor old Harper, at the very moment when they were
in hopes of radically improving his condition. They sent the courier off; but he was scarcely gone, when the
Doctor in the evening entered with a stranger, whose form and aspect were expressive, earnest, striking, and
whom no one knew. Both stood silent for a space; the stranger at length went up to Wilhelm, and holding out his
hand said: "Do you not know your old friend, then?" It was the Harper's voice; but of his form there seemed to
remain no vestige. He was in the common garb of a traveller, cleanly and genteely equipt; his beard had vanished;
his hair was dressed with some attention to the mode; and what particularly made him quite irrecognisable was,
that in his countenance the look of age was no longer visible. Wilhelm embraced him with the liveliest joy; he
was presented to the rest; and behaved himself with great propriety, not knowing that the party had a little while
before become so well acquainted with him. "You will have patience with a man," continued he with great
composure, "who, grown up as he appears, is entering on the world, after long sorrows, inexperienced as a child.
To this skilful gentleman I stand indebted for the privilege of again appearing in the company of my
fellow−men."
They bade him welcome: the Doctor motioned for a walk, to interrupt the conversation, and lead it to indifferent
topics.

Chapter X

282

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
In private, the Doctor gave the following explanation: "It was by the strangest chance that we succeeded in the
cure of this man. We had long treated him, morally and physically, as our best consideration dictated: in some
degree the plan was efficacious; but the fear of death continued powerful in him, and he would not lay aside his
beard and cloak. For the rest, however, he appeared to take more interest in external things than formerly; and
both his songs and his conceptions seemed to be approaching nearer life. A strange letter from the clergyman, as
you already know, called me from you. I arrived: I found our patient altogether changed; he had voluntarily given
up his beard; he had let his locks be cut into a customary form; he asked for common clothes; he seemed to have
at once become another man. Though curious to penetrate the reason of this sudden alteration, we did not risk
inquiring of himself: at last we accidentally discovered it. A glass of laudanum was missing from the Parson's
private laboratory: we thought it right to institute a strict inquiry on the subject; every one endeavoured to ward
off suspicion; and the sharpest quarrels rose among he inmates of the house. At last, this man appeared before us,
and admitted that he had the laudanum: we asked if he had swallowed any of it. 'No!' said he: but it is to this that I
owe the recovery of my reason. It is at your choice to take the vial from me; and to drive me back inevitably to
my former state. The feeling that it was desirable to see the pains of life terminated by death, first put me on the
way of cure; before long the thought of terminating them by voluntary death arose in me; and with this intention, I
took the glass of poison. The possibility of casting off my load of griefs forever gave me strength to bear them:
and thus have I, ever since this talisman came into my possession, pressed myself back into life, by a contiguity
with death. Be not anxious lest I use the drug; but resolve, as men acquainted with the human heart, by granting
me an independence of life, to make me properly and wholesomely dependent on it.' After mature consideration
of the matter, we determined not to meddle farther with him: and he now carries with him, in a firm little
ground−glass vial, this poison, of which he has so strangely made an antidote."
The Doctor was informed of all that had transpired since his departure; towards Augustin, it was determined that
they should observe the deepest silence in regard to it. The Abbé undertook to keep beside him, and to lead him
forward on the healthful path he had entered.
Meanwhile Wilhelm was to set about his journey over Germany with the Marchese. If it should appear that
Augustin could be again excited to affection for his native country, the circumstances were to be communicated to
his friends, and Wilhelm might conduct him thither.
Wilhelm had at last made every preparation for his journey. At first the Abbé thought it strange that Augustin
rejoiced in hearing of his friend and benefactor's purpose to depart; but he soon discovered the foundation of this
curious movement. Augustin could not subdue his fear of Felix; and he longed as soon as possible to see the boy
removed.
By degrees so many people had assembled, that the Castle and adjoining buildings could scarcely accommodate
them all; and the less, as such a multitude of guests had not originally been anticipated. They breakfasted, they
dined together; each endeavoured to persuade himself that they were living in a comfortable harmony, but each in
secret longed in some degree to be away. Theresa frequently rode out attended by Lothario, and oftener alone; she
had already got acquainted with all the landladies and landlords in the district; for she held it as a principle of her
economy, in which perhaps she was not far mistaken, that it is essential to be in good acceptance with one's
neighbours male and female, and to maintain with them a constant interchange of civilities. Of an intended
marriage with Lothario she appeared to have no thought. Natalia and the Countess often talked with one another;
the Abbé seemed to covet the society of Augustin; Jarno had frequent conversations with the Doctor; Friedrich
held by Wilhelm; Felix ran about, wherever he could meet with most amusement. It was thus too that in general
they paired themselves in walking, when the company broke up: when it was obliged to be together, recourse was
quickly had to music, to unite them all by giving each back to himself.
Unexpectedly the Count increased the party; intending to remove his lady, and, as it appeared, to take a solemn
farewell of his worldly friends. Jarno hastened to the coach to meet him: the Count inquired what guests they had;
to which the other answered, in a fit of wild humour that would often seize him: "We have all the nobility in
Chapter X

283

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
Nature; Marcheses, Marquises, Milords and Barons: we wanted nothing but a Count." They came upstairs.
Wilhelm was the first who met them in the ante−chamber. "Milord," said the Count to him in French, after
looking at him for a moment, "I rejoice very much in the unexpected pleasure of renewing my acquaintance with
your Lordship: I am very much mistaken if I did not see you at my Castle in the Prince's suite." "I had the
happiness of waiting on your Excellency at that time," answered Wilhelm; "but you do me too much honour when
you take me for an Englishman, and that of the first quality. I am a German, and ""A very brave young fellow,"
interrupted Jarno. The Count looked at Wilhelm with a smile, and was about to make some reply, when the rest of
the party entered, and saluted him with many a friendly welcome. They excused themselves for being unable at
the moment to show him to a proper chamber; promising without delay to make the necessary room for him.
"Ay, ay!" said he, smiling: "we have left Chance, I see, to act as our purveyor. Yet with prudence and
arrangement, how much is possible! For the present, I entreat you not to stir a slipper from its place; the disorder,
I perceive, would otherwise be great. Every one would be uncomfortably lodged; and this no one shall be on my
account, if possible, not even for an hour. You can testify," said he to Jarno, "and you too, Meister," turning to
Wilhelm, "how many people I commodiously stowed, that time, in my Castle. Let me have the list of persons and
servants; let me see how they are lodged at present: I will make a plan of dislocation, such that, with the very
smallest inconvenience, every one shall find a suitable apartment, and there shall be room enough to hold another
guest if one should accidentally arrive."
Jarno volunteered to be the Count's assistant; procured him all the necessary information; taking great delight, as
usual, if he could now and then contrive to lead him astray, and leave him in awkward difficulties. The old
gentleman at last, however, gained a signal triumph. The arrangement was completed; he caused the names to be
written on their several doors, himself attending; and it could not be denied that, by a very few changes and
substitutions, the object had been fully gained. Jarno, among other things, had also managed that the persons, who
at present took an interest in each other, should be lodged together.
"Will you help me," said the Count to Jarno, after everything was settled, "to clear up my recollections of the
young man there, whom you call Meister, and who, you tell me, is a German?" Jarno was silent; for he knew very
well that the Count was one of those people who, in asking questions, merely wish to show their knowledge. The
Count accordingly continued, without waiting for an answer: "You, I recollect, presented him to me; and warmly
recommended him in the Prince's name. If his mother was a German woman, I'll be bound for it his father is an
Englishman, and one of rank too: who can calculate the English blood that has been flowing, these last thirty
years, in German veins! I do not wish to pump you: I know you have always family secrets of that kind; but in
such cases it is in vain to think of cheating me." He then proceeded to detail a great variety of things as having
taken place with Wilhelm at the Castle; to the whole of which Jarno, as before, kept silence; though the Count
was altogether in the wrong, confounding Wilhelm more than once with a young Englishman of the Prince's suite.
The truth was, the good old gentleman had in former years possessed a very excellent memory; and was still
proud of being able to remember the minutest circumstances of his youth: but in regard to late occurrences, he
used to settle in his mind as true, and utter with the greatest certainty, whatever fables and fantastic combinations
in the growing weakness of his powers, imagination might present to him. For the rest, he was become extremely
mild and courteous; his presence had a very favourable influence upon the company. He would call on them to
read some useful book together; nay he often gave them little games, which, without participating in them, he
directed with the greatest care. If they wondered at his condescension, he would reply, that it became a man, who
differed from the world in weighty matters, to conform to it the more anxiously in matters of indifference.
In these games, our friend had, more than once, an angry and unquiet feeling to endure. Friedrich, with his usual
levity, took frequent opportunity of giving hints that Wilhelm entertained a secret passion for Natalia. How could
he have found it out? What entitled him to say so? And would not his friends think that, as they two were often
together, Wilhelm must have made a disclosure to him, so thoughtless and unlucky a disclosure? One day, while
they were merrier than common at some such joke, Augustin, dashing up the door, rushed in with a frightful look;
his countenance was pale, his eyes were wild; he seemed about to speak, but his tongue refused its office. The
Chapter X

284

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
party were astounded; Lothario and Jarno, supposing that his madness had returned, sprang up and seized him.
With a choked and faltering voice, then loudly and violently, he spoke and cried: "Not me! Haste! Help! Save the
child! Felix is poisoned!"
They let him go; he hastened through the door: all followed him in consternation. They called the Doctor;
Augustin made for the Abbés chamber; they found the child; who seemed amazed and frightened, when they
called to him from a distance: "What hast thou been doing?"
"Dear papa!" cried Felix, "I did not drink from the bottle, I drank from the glass: I was very thirsty."
Augustin struck his hands together: "He is lost!" cried he; then pressed through the bystanders, and hastened
away.
They found a glass of almond−milk upon the table, with a bottle near it more than half empty. The Doctor came;
was told what they had seen and heard: with horror he observed the well−known laudanum−vial lying empty on
the table. He called for vinegar, he summoned all his art to his assistance.
Natalia had the little patient taken to a room, she busied herself with painful care about him. The Abbé had run
out to seek Augustin, and draw some explanation from him. The unhappy father had been out upon the same
endeavour, but in vain: he returned, to find anxiety and fear on every face. The Doctor, in the mean time, had
been examining the almond−milk in the glass; he found it to contain a powerful mixture of opium: the child was
lying on the sofa, seeming very sick; he begged his father "not to let them pour more stuff into him, not to let
them plague him any more." Lothario had sent his people, and had ridden off himself, endeavouring to find some
trace of Augustin. Natalia sat beside the child; he took refuge in her bosom, and entreated earnestly for her
protection; earnestly for a little piece of sugar: the vinegar, he said, was biting sour. The Doctor granted his
request; the child was in a frightful agitation; they were obliged to let him have a moment's rest. The Doctor said
that every means had been adopted; he would continue to do his utmost. The Count came near, with an air of
displeasure: his look was earnest, even solemn: he laid his hands upon the child; turned his eyes to Heaven, and
remained some moments in that attitude. Wilhelm, who was lying inconsolable on a seat, sprang up, and casting a
despairing look at Natalia, left the room. Shortly afterwards the Count too left it.
"I cannot understand," said the Doctor, having paused a little, "how it comes that there is not the smallest trace of
danger visible about the child. At a single gulp, he must have swallowed an immense dose of opium; yet I find no
movement in his pulse but what may be ascribed to our remedies, and to the terror we have put him into."
In a few minutes Jarno entered, with intelligence that Augustin had been discovered in the upper story, lying in
his blood; a razor had been found beside him; to all appearance he had cut his throat. The Doctor hastened out: he
met the people carrying down the body. The unhappy man was laid upon a bed, and accurately examined: the cut
had gone across the windpipe; copious loss of blood had been succeeded by a swoon; yet it was easy to observe
that life, that hope was still there. The Doctor put the body in a proper posture; joined the edges of the wound, and
bandaged it. The night passed sleepless and full of care to all. Felix would not quit Natalia: Wilhelm sat before
her on a stool; he had the boy's feet upon his lap; the head and breast were lying upon hers. Thus did they divide
the pleasing burden and the painful anxiety; and continue, till the day broke, in their uncomfortable sad position.
Natalia had given her hand to Wilhelm; they did not speak a word; they looked at the child and then at one
another. Lothario and Jarno were sitting at the other end of the room, and carrying on a most important
conversation; which, did not the pressure of events forbid us, we would gladly lay before our readers. The boy
slept softly; he awoke quite cheerful, early in the morning, and demanded a piece of bread and butter.
So soon as Augustin had in some degree recovered, they endeavoured to obtain some explanation from him. They
learned with difficulty, and by slow degrees, that having, by the Count's unlucky shifting, been appointed to the
same chamber with the Abbé, he had found the manuscript in which his story was recorded. Struck with horror on
Chapter X

285

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
perusing it, he felt that it was now impossible for him to live; on which he had recourse as usual to the laudanum:
this he poured into a glass of almond−milk, and raised it to his mouth; but he shuddered when it reached his lips;
he set it down untasted; went out to walk once more across the garden, and behold the face of nature; and on his
return, he found the child employed in filling up the glass out of which it had been drinking.
They entreated the unhappy creature to be calm; he seized Wilhelm by the hand with a spasmodic grasp, and
cried: "Ah! why did I not leave thee long ago? I knew well that I should kill the boy, and he me." "The boy lives!"
said Wilhelm. The Doctor, who had listened with attention, now inquired of Augustin if all that drink was
poisoned. "No," replied he, "nothing but the glass." "By the luckiest chance, then,"' cried the Doctor, "the boy has
drunk from the bottle! A benignant Genius has guided his hand, that he did not catch at death, which stood so near
and ready for him." "No! no!" cried Wilhelm with a groan, and clapping both his hands upon his eyes: "How
dreadful are the words! Felix said expressly that he drank not from the bottle but the glass. His health is but a
show; he will die among our hands," Wilhelm hastened out; the Doctor went below, and taking Felix up, with
much caressing, asked: "Now did not you, my pretty boy? You drank from the bottle, not the glass?" The child
began to cry. The Doctor secretly informed Natalia how the matter stood: she also strove in vain to get the truth
from Felix, who but cried the more; cried till he fell asleep.
Wilhelm watched by him; the night went peacefully away. Next morning Augustin was found lying dead in bed;
he had cheated his attendants by a seeming rest; had silently loosened the bandages, and bled to death. Natalia
went to walk with Felix; he was sportful as in his happiest days. "You are always good to me," said Felix; "you
never scold, you never beat me; I will tell you the truth, I did drink from the bottle. Mamma Aurelia used to rap
me over the fingers every time I touched the bottle: father looked so sour, I thought he would beat me."
With winged steps Natalia hastened to the Castle; Wilhelm came, still overwhelmed with care, to meet her.
"Happy father!" cried she, lifting up the child, and throwing it into his arms: "there is thy son again! He drank
from the bottle: his naughtiness has saved him."
They told the Count the happy issue; but he listened with a smiling, silent, modest air of knowingness, like one
tolerating the error of worthy men. Jarno, attentive to all, could not explain this lofty self−complacency; till after
many windings, he at last discovered it to be his Lordship's firm belief that the child had really taken poison, and
that he himself, by prayer and the laying−on of hands, had miraculously counteracted the effects of it. After such
a feat, his Lordship now determined on departing. Everything, as usual with him, was made ready in a moment;
the fair Countess, when about to go, took Wilhelm's hand before parting with her sister's; she then pressed both
their hands between her own, turned quickly round, and stept into the carriage.
So many terrible and strange events, crowding one upon the back of another, inducing an unusual mode of life,
and putting everything into disorder and perplexity, had brought a sort of feverish movement into all departments
of the house. The hours of sleep and waking, of eating, drinking and social conversation were inverted. Except
Theresa, none of them had kept in their accustomed course. The men endeavoured, by increased potations, to
recover their good humour; and thus communicating to themselves an artificial vivacity, they drove away that
natural vivacity, which alone imparts to us true cheerfulness and strength for action.
Wilhelm, in particular, was moved and agitated by the keenest feelings. Those unexpected, frightful incidents had
thrown him out of all condition to resist a passion which had so forcibly seized his heart. Felix was restored to
him; yet still it seemed that he had nothing: Werner's letters, the directions for his journey were in readiness; there
was nothing wanting but the resolution to remove. Everything conspired to hasten him. He could not but
conjecture that Lothario and Theresa were awaiting his departure, that they might be wedded. Jarno was unusually
silent; you would have said that he had lost a portion of his customary cheerfulness. Happily the Doctor helped
our friend in some degree, from this embarrassment: he declared him sick, and set about administering medicine
to him.

Chapter X

286

Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship
The company assembled always in the evening: Friedrich, the wild madcap, who had often drunk more wine than
suited him, in general took possession of the talk; and by a thousand frolicsome citations, fantasies and waggish
allusions, often kept the party laughing; often also threw them into awkward difficulties, by the liberty he took to
think aloud.
In the sickness of his friend he seemed to have little faith. Once when they were all together, "Pray, Doctor," cried
he, "how is it you call the malady our friend is labouring under? Will none of the three thousand names, with
which you decorate your ignorance, apply to it? The disease at least is not without examples. There is one such
case," continued he with an emphatic tone, "in the Egyptian or Babylonian history."
The company looked at one another, and smiled.
"What call you the king−?" cried he, and stopped short a moment. "Well, if you will not help me, I must help
myself." He threw the door−leaves up, and pointed to the large picture in the antechamber. "What call you the
goat−beard there, with the crown on, who is standing at the foot of the bed, making such a rueful face about his
sick son? How call you the beauty, who enters, and in her modest roguish eyes at once brings poison and
antidote? How call you the quack of a doctor, who at this moment catches a glimpse of the reality, and for the first
time in his life takes occasion to prescribe a reasonable recipe, to give a drug which cures to the very heart, and is
at once salutiferous and savoury?"
In this manner he continued babbling. The company took it with as good a face as might be; hiding their
embarrassment behind a forced laugh. A slight blush overspread Natalia's cheeks, and betrayed the movements of
her heart. By good fortune, she was walking up and down with Jarno: on coming to the door, with a cunning
motion she slipped out, walked once or twice across the antechamber, and retired to her room.
The company were silent: Friedrich began to dance and sing:"O ye shall wonders see!What has been is not to
be;What is said is not to say,Before the break of dayYe shall wonders see!"
Theresa had gone out to find Natalia; Friedrich pulled the Doctor forward to the picture; pronounced a ridiculous
eulogium on medicine, and glided from the room.
Lothario had been standing all the while in the recess of a window; he was looking, without motion, down into the
garden. Wilhelm was in the most dreadful state. Left alone with his friends, he still kept silence for a time: he ran
with a hurried glance over all his history, and at last, with shuddering, surveyed his present situation; he started up
and cried: "If I am to blame for what is happening, for what you and I are suffering, punish me. In addition to my
other miseries, deprive me of your friendship, and let me wander, without comfort, forth into the wide world, in
which I should have mingled, and withdrawn myself from notice long ago. But if you see in me the victim of a
cruel entanglement of chance, out of which I could not thread my way, then give me the assurance of your love,
of your friendship, on a journey which I dare not now postpone. A time will come, when I may tell you what has
passed of late within me. Perhaps this is but a punishment, which I am suffering, because I did not soon enough
disclose myself to you, because I hesitated to display myself entirely as I was: you would have assisted me, you
would have helped me out in proper season. Again and again have my eyes been opened to my conduct; but it was
ever too late, it was ever in vain! How richly do I merit Jarno's censure! I imagined I had seized it; how firmly did
I purpose to employ it, to commence another life! Could I, might I have done so? It avails not for mortals to
complain of Fate or of themselves! We are wretched, and appointed for wretchedness; and what does it matter
whether blame of ours, higher influence or chance, virtue or vice, wisdom or folly plunge us into ruin? Farewell! I
will not stay another moment in a house, where I have so fearfully violated the rights of hospitality. Your brother's
indiscretion is unpardonable; it aggravates my suffering to the highest pitch, it drives me to despair."
"And what," replied Lothario, taking Wilhelm by the hand, "what if your alliance with my sister were the secret
article on which depended my alliance with Theresa? This amends that noble maiden has appointed for you; she

has vowed that these two pairs should appear together at the altar. 'His reason has made choice of me,' said she;
'his heart demands Natalia: my reason shall assist his heart.' We agreed to keep our eyes upon Natalia and
yourself; we told the Abbé of our plan, who made us promise not to intermeddle with this union, or attempt to
forward it, but to suffer everything to take its course. We have done so, Nature has performed her part; our mad
brother only shook the ripe fruit from the branch. And now, since we have come together so unusually, let us lead
no common life; let us work together in a noble manner, and for noble purposes! It is inconceivable how much a
man of true culture can accomplish for himself and others, if, without attempting to rule, he can be the guardian
over many; can induce them to do that in season, which they are at any rate disposed enough to do; can guide
them to their objects, which in general they see with due distinctness, though they miss the road to them. Let us
make a league for this: it is no enthusiasm; but an idea which may be fully executed, which indeed is often
executed, only with imperfect consciousness, by people of benevolence and worth. Natalia is a living instance of
it. No other need attempt to rival the plan of conduct which has been prescribed by nature for that pure and noble
soul."
He had more to say, but Friedrich with a shout came jumping in. "What a garland have I earned!" cried he: "how
will you reward me? Myrtle, laurel, ivy, leaves of oak, the freshest you can find, come twist them: I have merits
far beyond them all. Natalia is thine! I am the conjuror who raised this treasure for thee."
"He raves," said Wilhelm; "I must go."
"Art thou empowered to speak?" inquired Lothario, holding Wilhelm from retiring.
"By my own authority," said Friedrich, "and the grace of God. It was thus I was the wooer; thus I am the
messenger: I listened at the door; she told the Abbé everything."
"Barefaced rogue! who bade thee listen?" said Lothario.
"Who bade her bolt the door?" cried Friedrich. "I heard it all: she was in a wondrous pucker. In the night when
Felix seemed so ill, and was lying half upon her knees, and thou wert sitting comfortless before her, sharing the
beloved load, she made a vow, that if the child died, she would confess her love to thee, and offer thee her hand.
And now when the child lives, why should she change her mind? What we promise under such conditions, we
keep under any. Nothing wanting but the parson! He will come, and marvel what strange news he brings."
The Abbé entered. "We know it all," cried Friedrich: "be as brief as possible; it is mere formality you come for;
they never send for you or me on any other score."
"He has listened," said the Baron.−"Scandalous!" exclaimed the Abbé.
"Now, quick!" said Friedrich. "How stands it with the ceremonies? These we can reckon on our fingers. You must
travel; the Marchese's invitation answers to a hairsbreadth. If we had you once beyond the Alps, it will all be
right: the people are obliged to you for undertaking anything surprising; you procure them an amusement which
they are not called to pay for. It is as if you gave a free ball; all ranks partake in it."
"In such popular festivities," replied the Abbé, "you have done the public much service in your time; but today, it
seems, you will not let me speak at all."
"If it is not just as I have told it," answered Friedrich, "let us have it better. Come round, come round; we must see
them both together."
Lothario embraced his friend, and led him to Natalia, who with Theresa came to meet them. All were silent.

"No loitering!" cried Friedrich. "In two days you may be ready for your travels. Now, think you, friend,"
continued he, addressing Wilhelm, "when we first scraped acquaintance, and I asked you for the pretty nosegay,
who could have supposed you were ever to receive a flower like this from me?"
"Do not at the moment of my highest happiness, remind me of those times!"
"Of which you need not be ashamed, any more than one need be ashamed of his descent. The times were very
good times: only I cannot but laugh to look at thee; to my mind, thou resemblest Saul the son of Kish, who went
out to seek his father's asses, and found a kingdom."
"I know not the worth of a kingdom," answered Wilhelm; "but I know I have attained a happiness which I have
not deserved, and which I would not change with anything in life."

Genealogy of Fanaticism
In itself, every idea is neutral, or should be; but man animates
ideas, projects his flames and flaws into them; impure, transformed
into beliefs, ideas take their place in time, take shape as

events:

the

trajectory is complete, from logic to epilepsy ... whence the birth
of ideologies, doctrines, deadly games.
Idolaters by instinct, we convert the objects of our dreams and
our interests into the Unconditional. History is nothing but a proces­
sion of false Absolutes, a series of temples raised to pretexts, a
degradation of the mind before the Improbable. Even when he turns
from religion, man remains subject to it; depleting himself to create
fake gods, he then feverishly adopts them: his need for fiction, for
mythology triumphs over evidence and absurdity alike. His power
to adore is responsible for all his crimes: a man who loves a god
unduly forces other men to love his god, eager to exterminate them
if they refuse. There is no form of intolerance, of proselytism or
ideological intransigence which fails to reveal the bestial substratum
of enthusiasm. Once man loses hisfaculty of indifference he becomes
a potential murderer; once he transforms

his

idea into a god the

consequences are incalculable. We kill only in the name of a god or
of his counterfeits: the excesses provoked by the goddess Reason,
by the concept of nation, class, or race are akin to those of the
Inquisition or of the Reformation. The ages of fervor abound in
bloody exploits: a Saint Teresa could only be the contemporary of
the auto-da-fe, a Luther of the repression of the Peasants' Revolt.
In every mystic outburst, the moans of victims parallel the moans

of ecstasy ...Scaffolds, dungeons, jails flourish only in the shadow
of a faith - of that need to believe which has infested the mind
forever. The devil pales beside the man who owns a truth,

his

truth. We are unfair to a Nero, a Tiberius: it was not they who
invented the concept heretic: they were only degenerate dreamers who
happened to be entertained by massacres. The real criminals are
men who establish an orthodoxy on the religious or political level,
men who distinguish between the faithful and the schismatic.
When we refuse to admit the interchangeable character of ideas,
blood flows ... firm resolves draw the dagger; fiery eyes presage
slaughter.No wavering mind, infected with Harnletism, was ever
pernicious: the principle of evil lies in the will's tension, in the
incapacity for quietism, in the Promethean megalomania of a race
that bursts with ideals, that explodes with its convictions, and that,
in return for having forsaken doubt and sloth - vices nobler than all
its virtues - has taken the path to perdition, into history. that inde­
cent alloy of banality and apocalypse ... Here certitudes abound:
suppress them, best of all suppress their consequences, and you
recover paradise. W hat is the Fall but the pursuit of a truth and the
assurance you have found it, the passion for a dogma, domicile
within a dogma? The result is fanaticism - fundamental defect which
gives man the craving for effectiveness. for prophecy: for terror -

a

lyrical leprosy by which he contaminates souls, subdues them,
crushes or exalts them ...Only the skeptics (or idlers or aesthetes)
escape, because they

propose

nothing, because they - humanity's

true benefactors - undermine fanaticism's purposes, analyze its
frenzy. I feel safer with a Pyrrho than with a Saint Paul, for a jesting
wisdom is gentler than an unbridled sanctity. In the fervent mind
you always find the camouflaged beast of prey; no protection is
adequate against the claws of a prophet ...Once he raises his voice,
whether in the name of heaven, of the city, or some other excuse,
away with you: satyr of your solitude, he will not forgive your living
on the wrong side of his truths and his transports; he wants you to
share his hysteria, his fullness, he wants to impose it on you, and
thereby to disfigure you.A human being possessed by a belief and

4

Directionsfor Decomposition
not eager to pass it on to others is a phenomenon alien to the earth,
where our mania for salvation makes life unbreathable. Look around
you: everywhere, specters preaching; each institution translates a
mission; city halls have their absolute, even as the temples - official­
dom, with its rules - a metaphysics designed for monkeys ...
Everyone trying to remedy everyone's life: even beggars, even the
incurable aspire to it: the sidewalks and hospitals of the world over­
flow with reformers. The longing to become a source of events
affects each man like a mental disorder or a desired malediction.
Society - an inferno of saviors! W hat Diogenes was looking for with
his lantern was an indifferent man ...
It is enough for me to hear someone talk sincerely about ideals,
about the future, about philosophy, to hear him say 'we' with a
certain inflection of assurance, to hear him invoke 'others' and
regard himself as their interpreter - for me to consider him my
enemy.I see in him a tyrant manque, an approximate executioner,
quite as detestable as the first-rate tyrants, the first-rate executioners.
Every faith practices some form of terror, all the more dreadful
when the 'pure' are its agents.We mistrust the swindler, the trickster,
the con man; yet to them we can impute none of history's great
convulsions; believing in nothing, it is not they who rummage in
your hearts, or your ulterior motives; they leave you to your apathy,
to your despair or to your uselessness; to them humanity owes the
few moments of prosperity it has known: it is they who save the
peoples whom fanatics torture and 'idealists' destroy. Doctrineless,
they have only whims and interests, accommodating vices a thou­
sand times more endurable than the ravages provoked by principled
despotism; for all of life's evils come from a 'conception of life.' An
accomplished politician should search out the ancient sophists and
take lessons in oratory - and in corruption ...
W hereas the fanatic is incorruptible: if he kills for an idea, he can
just as well get himself killed for one; in either case, tyrant or martyr,
he is a monster.No human beings are more dangerous than those
who have suffered for a belief: the great persecutors are recruited
among the martyrs not quite beheaded.Far from diminishing the

5

A

Short History of Decay

appetite for power, suffering exasperates it; hence the mind feels
more comfortable in the society of a braggart than in that of a
martyr; and nothing is more repugnant to it than the spectacle of
dy ing for an idea ... Revolted by the sublime and by carnage, the
mind dreams of a provincial ennui on the scale of the universe, of a
History whose stagnation would be so great that doubt would take
on the lineaments of an event and hope a calamity ...

The Anti-Prophet
In every man sleeps a prophet and when he wakes there is a little
more evil in the world ...
The compulsion to preach is so rooted in us that it emerges from
depths unknown to the instinct for self-preservation. Each of us awaits
his moment in order to propose something - anything.He has a voice:
that is enough.It costs us dear to be neither deaf nor dumb ...
From snobs to scavengers, all expend their criminal generosity;
all hand out formulas for happiness, all try to give directions: life in
common thereby becomes intolerable, and life with oneself still
more so; if you fail to meddle in other people's business you are so
uneasy about your

'self' into a religion,

or, apostle in reverse, you deny it altogether; we are victims of the
universal game ...
The abundance of solutions to the aspects of existence is equaled
only by their futility History: a factory of ideals ...lunatic mythol­
ogy, frenzy of hordes and of solitaries ...refusal to look reality in
the face, mortal thirst for fictions ...
The source of our actions resides in an unconscious propensity
to regard ourselves as the center, the cause, and the conclusion of
time.Our reflexes and our pride transform into a planet the parcel
of flesh and consciousness we are.If we had the right sense of our
position in the world, if to compare were inseparable from to live, the
revelation of our infinitesimal presence would crush us.But to live
is to blind ourselves to our own dimensions . ..

6

Directions for Decomposition
And if all our actions - from breathing to the founding of empires
or metaphysical systems - derive from an illusion as to our import­
ance, the same is true a fortiori of the prophetic instinct.Who, with
the exact vision of his nullity, would try to be effective and to turn
himself into a savior?
Nostalgia for a world without 'ideals: for an agony without
doctrine, for an eternity without life ...Paradise ...But we could
not exist one second without deceiving ourselves: the prophet in
each of us is just the seed of madness which makes us flourish in
our void.
The ideally lucid, hence ideally normal, man should have no
recourse beyond the nothing that is in him ... I can imagine him
saying: 'Torn from the goal, from all goals, I retain, of my desires
and my displeasures, only their formulas. Having resisted the temp­
tation to conclude, I have overcome the mind, as I have overcome
life itself by the horror of looking for an answer to it.The spectacle
of man - what an emetic! Love - a duel of salivas .. All the feelings

milk their absolute from the misery of the glands.Nobility is only
in the negation of existence, in a smile that sur veys annihilated
landscapes. Once I had a "self"; now I am no more than an object
... I gorge myself on all the drugs of solitude; those of the world
were too weak to make me forget it.Having killed the prophet in
me, how could I still have a place among men?'

In the Graveyard of Definitions
Are we entitled to imagine a mind exclaiming: 'Everything is purpose­
less to me now, for I have given the definitions of all things'? And if
we could imagine such a mind, how locate it within duration?
What surrounds us we endure better for giving it

a

name - and

moving on.But to embrace a thing by a definition, however arbitrary
- and all the more serious the more arbitrary it is, since the soul
then overtakes knowledge - is to reject that thing, to render it insipid
and superfluous, to annihilate it.The idle, empty mind- which joins

7

A

the world only by the grace of sleep - can practice only by extend­
ing the name of things, by emptying them and substituting formulas
for them. Then it maneuvers over their debris; no more sensations;
nothing but memories. Under each formula lies a corpse: being and
object alike die under the pretext they have occasioned. This is the
mind's frivolous, funereal debauch. And this mind has squandered
itself in what it has named and circumscribed. Infatuated by syl­
lables, it loathed the mystery of heavy silences and turned them
light and pure; and it too has become light and pure, indeed light­
ened and purified of everything. The vice of defining has made it a
gracious assassin, and a discreet victim.
This is how the stain the soul spread over the mind has been
removed - the only thing which reminded it that it was alive.

Civilization and Frivolity
How could we bear the weight and sheer depth of works and master­

pieces, if to their texture certain impertinent and delicious minds
had not added the fringes of subtle scorn and ready ironies? And how
could we endure the codes, the customs, the paragraphs of the heart
which inertia and propriety haw> �llpprimpmpcl1Jp0n the futile md
intelligent vices, if it were not for those playful beings whose refine­
ment puts them at once at the apex and in the margin of society?
We must be thankful to the civilizations which have not taken
an overdose of seriousness, which have played with values and taken
their pleasure in begetting and destroying them. Who knows, outside
of the Greek and French civilizations, a more lucidly facetious proof
of the elegant nothingness of things? The age of Alcibiades and the
eighteenth century in France are t wo sources of consolation. While
it is only at their final stages, at the dissolution of a whole system
of behavior and belief, that the other civilizations could enjoy that
lively exercise which lends a flavor of futility to life, it was in full
ripeness, in full possession of their powers and of the future that
these two epochs knew the tedium heedless of everything and

8

Directionsfor Decomposition
permeable to everything.What better symbol than that of Madame
du Deffand, old, blind, and perspicacious, who even while execrat­
ing life, nonetheless relished to the last its every amenity of gall?
No one achieves frivolity straight off.It is a privilege and an art;
it is the pursuit of the superficial by those who, having discerned
the impossibility of any certitude, have conceived a disgust for such
things; it is the escape far from one abyss or another which, being
by nature bottomless, can lead nowhere.
There remain, nonetheless, the appearances; why not raise them
to the level of a style? Thereby we define every intelligent period.
Thereby we find more prestige in expression than in the soul which
supports it, in grace than in intuition; emotion itself becomes polite.
The human being delivered to himself, without any partiality for
elegance, is a monster; he finds only dark regions there, where terror
and negation, imminent, prowl.To know, by all one's vitality, that
one will die, and to be unable to conceal it, is an act of barbarism.
Any sincere philosophy renounces the claims of civilization, whose
function consists in sifting our secrets and disguising them as recher­
che effects.Thus, frivolity is the most effective antidote to the disease
of being what one is: by frivolity we abuse the world and dissimulate
the impropriety of our depths.Without its artifices, how could we
help blushing to have a soul? Our skin-deep solitudes, what an
inferno for other people! But it is always for them, and sometimes
for ourselves, that we invent our appearances ...

Dissolving into God
The mind scrupulous of its distinct essence is threatened at every
turn by the things it rejects.Often abandoning attention - the great­
est of its privileges - such a mind yields to the temptations it has
sought to escape, or becomes the prey of impure mysteries . ..Who
has not known those fears, those dizzy spells, those deliriums which
bring us back to the beast, back to the last problems? Our knees
tremble but do not bend; our hands clutch without clasping each

9

A

other; our eyes look up and see nothing ...We preserve that vertical
pride which strengthens its courage; that horror of gestures which
saves us from spectacle; and the succor of eyelids to veil an absurdly
ineffable gaze.Our collapse is imminent but not inevitable; the acci­
dent is odd, but scarcely new; already a smile dawns on the horizon
of our terrors ...we shall not topple into prayer ...For after all He
must not triumph; it is up to our irony to compromise His capital
letter; up to our heart to dissolve the shudders He dispenses.

If such a Being really existed, if our weaknesses vanquished our
resolutions and our depths our deliberations, then why go on thinking,
since our difficulties would be settled, our questions suspended, and
our fears allayed? Which would be too easy. Every absolute - personal
or abstract - is a way of avoiding the problems, and not only the prob­
lems, but also their root, which is nothing but a panic of the senses.
God: a perpendicular fall upon our fear, a salvation landing like
a thunderbolt amid our investigations which no hope deceives, the
immediate annihilation of our unconsoled and determinedly incon­
solable pride, a Sidetracking of the individual, the soul on the dole
for lack of anxiety ...
What greater renunciation than Faith? True, without it we are
committed to an infinity of dead ends.But even when we know that
nothing leads anywhere, that the universe is only

:l

hy-product of

our gloom, why should we sacrifice this pleasure of tottering and
of splitting our skulls against heaven and earth?
The solutions offered by our ancestral cowardice are the worst
desertions of our duty to intellectual decency. To be fooled, to live
and die duped, is certainly what men do.But there exists a dignity
which keeps us from disappearing into God and which transforms
all our moments into prayers we shall never offer.

Variations on Death
I. It is because it rests on nothing, because it lacks even the shadow
of an argument, that we persevere in life.Death is too exact; it has

10

Directions for Decomposition

all the reasons on its side.Mysterious for our instincts, it takes shape,
to our reflection, limpid, without glamor, and without the false lures
of the unknown.
By dint of accumulating non-mysteries and monopolizing non­
meanings. life inspires more dread than death: it is life which is the
Great Unknown.
W here can so much Void and Incomprehensibility lead? We cling
to the days because the desire to die is too logical, hence ineffective.
If life had a single argument in its favor - distinct. indisputable - it
would annihilate itself; instincts and prejudices collapse at the
contact of Rigor. Everything that breathes feeds on the unverifiable;
a dose of logic would be deadly to existence - that effort toward the
Senseless ... Give life a specific goal and it immediately loses its
attraction. The inexactitude of its ends makes life superior to death;
one touch of precision would degrade it to the triviality of the
tombs.For a positive science of the meaning of life would depopu­
late the earth in a day. and not even a madman could succeed in
reviving the fruitful improbability of Desire.
II.Men can be classified according to the most whimsical criteria:
according to their humors. their inclinations. their dreams, or their
glands.We change ideas like neckties; for every idea, every criterion
comes from outside, from the configurations and accidents of time.
But there is something that comes from ourselves, that is ourselves,
an invisible but inwardly verifiable reality, an unwonted and eternal
presence that we can conceive at any moment and that we never
dare admit, which is real only before its consummation: death, the
true criterion ... And it is death. the most intimate dimension of
all the living, which separates humanity into two orders so irredu­
cible, so removed from each other. that there is more distance
between them than between a v ulture and a mole,

a

star and a

starfish.The abyss of two incommunicable worlds opens between
the man who has the sentiment of death and the man who does
not; yet both die; but one is unaware of his death, the other knows;
one dies only for a moment, the other unceasingly ... Their

II

A Short History of Decay

common condition locates them precisely at each other's antipodes,
at the two extremities and within one and the same definition;
irreconcilable, they suffer the same fate .. . One lives as if he were
eternal; the other thinks continually of his eternity and denies it
in each thought.
Nothing can change our life but the gradual insinuation within
us of the forces which annihilate it. No new principle comes to it
from the surprises of our growth nor from the efflorescence of our
gifts; they are merely natural to it. And nothing natural can make
us anything but ourselves.
Everything which prefigures death adds a quality of novelty to
life, modifies and amplifies it. Health preserves life as such, in a
sterile identity; while disease is an activity, the most intense a man
can indulge in, a frenetic and . . . stationary movement, the richest
expenditure of energy

without gesture,

the hostile and impassioned

expectation of an irreparable lightning bolt.
III.Against the obsession with death, both the subterfuges of hope
and the arguments of reason lay down their arms: their insignifi­
cance merely whets the appetite to die. In order to triumph over
this appetite, there is but one 'method': to live it to the end, to submit
to all its pleasures. all its pangs, to do nothing to ell1de it An oh<:p<:­
sion experienced to the point of satiety is annihilated in its own
excesses.By dwelling on the infinity of death, thought manages to
use

it up, to inspire disgust for it in us, disgust, that negative superflu­

ity which spares nothing and which, before compromising and
diminishing the prestige of death, shows us the inanity of life.
The man who has not given himself up to the pleasures of
anguish, who has not savored in his mind the dangers of his own
extinction nor relished such cruel and sweet annihilations, will never
be cured of the obsession with death: he will be tormented by it,
for he will have resisted it; while the man who, habituated to a
discipline of horror, and meditating upon his own carrion, has
deliberately reduced himself to ashes - that man will look toward
death's past, and he himself will be merely a resurrected being who can

12

Directions for Decomposition

no longer live.

His 'method' will have cured him of both life and

death.
Every crucial experience is fatal: the layers of existence lack
density; the man who explores them, archaeologist of the heart, of
being, finds himself, at the end of his researches, confronting empty

depths.

He will vainly regret the panoply of appearances.

Hence the ancient Mysteries, so-called revelations of the ultimate
secrets, have bequeathed us nothing by way of knowledge. The
initiates were doubtless obliged to keep silence; yet it is inconceiv­
able that not a single chatterbox was among their number; what is
more contrary to human nature than such stubbornness in secrecy?
The fact is that there were no

secrets;

there were rites, there were

shudders. Once the veils had fallen, what could they discover but
insignificant consequences?

to the mockery of being alive .

The only initiation is to nothingness - and

. . And I dream of an Eleusis of disabused

hearts, of a lucid Mystery, without gods and without the vehe­
mences of illusion.

In the Margin of Moments
It is our incapacity to weep which sustains our taste for things, which
makes them exist at all: it keeps us from exhausting their savor and
from turning away. W hen, on so many brinks and byroads, our eyes
refused to drown in themselves, their dryness preserved the object
which amazed them. Our tears squander nature as our terrors do
God . . . but in the end, they squander ourselves. For we

exist only

by the refusal to give free rein to our supreme desires: the things
which enter the sphere of our admiration or our despair remain
there only because we have neither sacrificed them nor blessed them
with our liquid farewells.
So it is that after each night, facing a new day, the impossible
necessity of dealing with it fills us with dread; exiled in light as if
the world had just started, inventing the sun, we flee from tears just one of which would be enough to wash us out of time.

13

Dislocation of Time
The moments follow each other; nothing lends them the illusion

of a content or the appearance of a meaning; they pass; their course
is not ours; we contemplate that passage, prisoners of a stupid
perception.The heart's void confronting time's: two mirrors, reflect­
ing each other's absence, one and the same image of nullity .. .As
though by the effect of a dreamy idiocy, everything is leveled: no
more peaks, no more plunges ... Where to locate the poetry of
lies, the goad of an enigma?
The man who knows nothing of ennui is still in the world's child­
hood, when the ages were waiting to be born; he remains closed off
from that tired time which outlives itself, which laughs at its dimen­
sions, and succumbs on the threshold of its own ...future, dragging
along matter, suddenly raised to a lyricism of negation.Ennui is the
echo in us of time tearing itself apart ...the revelation of the void,

the drying up of that delirium which sustains -or invents -life ...
Creator of values, man is the delirious creature

par excellence,

victim of the belief that something exists, whereas he need merely
stirs; suppress his whims: the world turns to ashes.Reality is a cre­
ation of our excesses, of our disproportions and derangements.Rein
in your palpitations and the course of events slows down; without
our ardors, space is ice.Time itself passes only because our desires
beget that decorative universe which a jot of lUCidity would lay bare.
One touch of clearsightedness reduces us to our primal state: naked­
ness; a suspicion of irony strips us of that trumpery hope which lets
us dupe ourselves and devise illusion: every contrary path leads
outside of life. Ennui is merely the beginning of such an itinerary
... It makes us find time long, too long -unsuited to show us

an

end.Detached from every object, having nothing external to assim­
ilate, we destroy ourselves in slow motion, since the future has
stopped offering us a

raison d'etre.

Directions for Decomposition

Ennui shows us an eternity which is not the transcendence of
time, but its wreck; it is the infinity of souls that have rotted for lack
of superstitions, a banal absolute where nothing any longer keeps
things from turning in circles, in search of their own Fall.
Life creates itself in delirium and is undone in ennui.
(The man suffering from a characterized sickness is not entitled to
complain: he has an occupation.The great sufferers are never bored:
disease fills them, the way remorse feeds the great criminals. For
any intense suffering produces a simulacrum of plenitude and
proposes a terrible reality to consciousness, which it cannot elude;
while suffering without

substance

in that temporal mourning of

ennui affords consciousness nothing that forces it to fruitful action.
How to cure an unlocalized and supremely impalpable disease which
infects the body without leaving any trace upon it, which insinuates
itself into the soul without marking it by any sign? Ennui is like a
sickness we have survived, but one which has absorbed our possi­
bilities, our reserves of

attention

and has left us impotent to fill the

void which follows upon the disappearance of· our pangs and the
fading of our torments.Hell is a haven next to this displacement in
time, this empty and prostrate languor in which nothing stops us
but the spectacle of the universe decaying before our eyes.
What therapeutics to invoke against a disease we no longer
remember and whose aftermath encroaches upon our days? How
invent a remedy for existence, how conclude this endless cure? And
how recover from your own birth?
Ennui, that incurable convalescence ...)

Magnificent Futility
With the exception of the Greek skeptics and the Roman emperors
of the Decadence, all minds seem enslaved by a municipal vocation.
Only these two groups are emancipated, the former by doubt, the
latter by dementia, from the insipid obsession of being useful.

15

A ShoTt History of Decay
Having promoted the arbitrary to the rank of drill or delirium,
depending on whether they were philosophers or disabused scions
of the old conquerors, they were attached to nothing: in this regard,
they suggest the saints.But while the saints were never to collapse,
these others found themselves at the mercy of their own game,
masters and victims of their whims - true solitaries, since their
solitude was sterile. No one has followed their example and they
themselves proposed no such thing; hence they communicated with
their 'kind' only by irony and terror ...
To be the dissolvent of a philosophy or of an empire: what pride
could be more melancholy and more majestic? To kill, on the one
hand, truth, and greatness on the other, manias which nourish the

ancient symbols, I should have liberated myself; I should have shared

with all the arrows of a dissolute wisdom - among the courtesans,

Exegesis of Failure

Our kind is not a fatality but the temptation to fail.Incapable of
keeping our hands clean and our hearts undiluted, we soil ourselves
upon contact with strange sweats, we wallow - craving for disgust
and fervent for pestilence - in the unanimous mud.And when we
dream of seas changed into holy water, it is too late to dive into
them, and our advanced state of corruption keeps us from drown­
ing there: the world has infested our solitude; upon us the traces of
others become indelible.
In the gamut of creatures, only man inspires a sustained disgust.

we all speak.We betray ourselves, we exhibit our heart; executioner
of the unspeakable, each of us labors to destroy all the mysteries,
beginning with our own. And if we meet others, it is to degrade
ourselves together in a race to the void, whether in the exchange of
ideas, schemes, or confessions. Curiosity has provoked not only the
first fall but the countless ones of every day of our lives. Life is only
that impatience to fall, to fail, to prostitute the soul's virginal soli­
tudes by dialogue, ageless and everyday negation of Paradise. Man
should listen only to himself in the endless ecstasy of the intransmis­
sible Word, should create words for his own silences and assents
audible only to his regrets. But he is the chatterbox of the universe;
he speaks in the name of others; his self loves the plural. And anyone
who speaks in the name of others is always an impostor. Politicians,
reformers, and all who rely on a collective pretext are cheats. There
is only the artist whose lie is not a total one, for he invents only
himself. Outside of the surrender to the incommunicable, the
suspension amid our mute and unconsoled anxieties, life is merely
a fracas on an unmapped terrain, and the universe a geometry
stricken with epilepsy.

Shakespeare, by a stroke of luck, never 'served' anything.

Coalition against Death
How imagine other people's lives, when our own seems scarcely
conceivable? We meet someone, we see him plunged into an impen­
etrable and unjustifiable world, in a mass of desires and convictions
superimposed on reality like a morbid structure. Having made a
system of mistakes for himself, he suffers for reasons whose nullity
alarms the mind and surrenders himself to values whose absurdity
leaps to the eye. What are his undertakings but trifles, and is the
feverish symmetry of his concerns any better built than an archi­
tecture of twaddle? To the outside observer, the absolute of each
life looks interchangeable, and every fate, however fixed in its essence,
arbitrary. When our convictions seem the fruit of a frivolous lunacy,
how tolerate other people's passions for themselves and for their
own multiplication in each day's utopia? By what necessity does this
man shut himself up in a particular world of predilections, and that
man in another?
When we endure the confidences of a friend or a stranger, the
revelation of his secrets fills us with astonishment.Are we to relate
his torments to drama or to farce? This depends entirely on the good
will or the exasperations of our lassitude.Each fate being no more
than a refrain fluttering around a few bloodstains, it is up to our
moods to see in the disposition of such sufferings a superfluous and
piquant order, or a pretext for pity.
Since it is difficult to approve the reasons people invoke, each time
we leave one of our fellow men, the question which comes to mind
is invariably the same: how does he keep from killing himself ? For
nothing is more natural than to imagine other people's suicide. When
we have glimpsed, by an overwhelming and readily renewable intu­
ition, anyone's own uselessness, it is incomprehensible that everyone
has not done the same.To do away with oneself seems such a clear
and simple action! Why is it so rare, why does everyone avoid it?
Because, if reason disavows the appetite for life, the nothing which

19

A Short History of Decay
extends our acts is nonetheless of a power superior to all absolutes;
it explains the tacit coalition of mortals against death; it is not only
the symbol of existence, but existence itself; it is everything.And this
nothing, this everything, cannot give life a meaning, but it nonethe­
less makes life persevere in what it is: a state of non-suicide.

Supremacy of the Adjective
Since there can be only a limited number of ways to face the ultimate
problems, the mind is limited in its expansion by that natural
boundary which is the essential, by that impossibility of indefinitely
multiplying the capital difficulties: history is solely concerned with
changing the aspect of a sum of questions and solutions.What the
mind invents is merely a series of new qualifications; it rebaptizes
the elements or seeks in its lexicons less eroded epithets for the one
immutable pain. We have always suffered, but our suffering has been
either 'sublime' or 'legitimate' or 'absurd' according to the general
views which the philosophic moment maintained. Misery consti­
tutes the texture of all that breathes; but its modalities have changed
course; they have composed that series of irreducible appearances
which lead each of us to believe he is thp first tn hwe suffe!'ed

so.

The pride of such uniqueness incites us to cherish our own pain and
to endure it.In a world of sufferings, each of them is a solipsist in
relation to all the rest.Misery's originality is due to the verbal qual­
ity which isolates it in the sum of words and sensations ...
The qualifiers change: this change is called intellectual progress.
Suppress them all and what would remain of civilization? The differ­
ence between intelligence and stupidity resides in the manipulation
of the adjective, whose use without diversity constitutes banality.
God Himself lives only by the adjectives we add to Him; whereby
the raison d'etre of theology. Hence man, by modulating the monot­
ony of his misery ever variously. justifies himself to the mind only
by the impassioned search for a new adjective.

(And yet this search is pitiable. The poverty of

expression,

which is

the mind's poverty, is manifest in the indigence of words, in their
exhaustion and their degradation: the attributes by which we deter­
mine things and sensations finally lie before us like so much verbal
carrion.And we glance regretfully at the time when they gave off
no more than an odor of confinement. All Alexandrianism begins
with the need to ventilate words, to make up for their blemishes by
a lively refinement; but it ends in a lassitude in which mind and
word are mingled and decompose. [Ideally, the final stage of a

SO long as our untried senses and our naive heart recognize
themselves and delight in the universe of qualifications, they flour­
ish with the aid and at the risk of the adjective, which, once dissected,
proves inadequate, deficient. We say of space, of time, and of suffering
that they are infinite; but infinite has no more bearing than beautiful,
sublime, harmonious, ugly ... Suppose we force ourselves to see
to the bottom of words? We see nothing - each of them, detached
from the expansive and fertile soul, being null and void.The power
of the intelligence functions by projecting a certain luster upon
them, by polishing them and making them glitter; this power,
erected into a system, is called culture - pyrotechnics against a night
sky of nothingness.)

The Devil Reassured

He lack interest, vigor, actuality and resemble us so little? Is there any

We do not pray to what is the evidence: the

not an object of worship. We have placed in our double all our
attributes, and, in order to afford him a semblance of solemnity,
we have dressed him in black: our vices and our virtues in mourn­
ing. By endowing him with wickedness and perseverance, our
dominant qualities, we have exhausted ourselves to make him as
lively as possible; our powers have been used up in creating his
image, in making him agile, frisky, intelligent, ironic, and above
all petty. The reserves of energy we still had left to produce God
were reduced to nothing. Then we resorted to the imagination
and to what little blood we had left: God could be only the fruit
of our anemia: a tottering and rachitic image. He is mild, good,
sublime, just.But who recognizes himself in that mixture redolent
of rose water, relegated to transcendence? A Being without dupli­
city lacks depth, lacks mystery; He hides nothing.Only impurity
is a sign of reality.And if the saints are not completely stripped of
interest, it is because their sublimity is tinged with the novelistic,
their eternity lends itself to biography; their

lives indicate that they

have left the world for a genre capable of captivating us from time
to time ...
Because he overflows with life. the Devil has no altar: man recog­

good reason; he repudiates

himself, and maintains the indigent atrib­

found a religion: are we not here to safeguard him from inanition
and oblivion?

Promenade around the Circumference
Within the circle which encloses human beings in a community of
interests and hopes, the mind opposed to mirages clears a path from
the center toward the periphery.It can no longer hear at close range
the hum of humanity; it wants to consider from as far away as

Directions for Decomposition
possible the accursed symmetry which links men together. It sees
martyrs everywhere: some sacrificing themselves for visible needs,
others for inestimable necessities, all ready to bury their names
under a certitude; and, since not all of them can succeed, the major­
ity expiate by banality the overflow of blood they have dreamed of
. . . their lives consist of an enormous freedom to die which they
have not taken advantage of: inexpressive holocaust of history; the
boneyard swallows them up.
But the enthusiast of separations, seeking paths unhaunted by
the hordes, withdraws to the extreme margin and follows the rim
of the circle, which he cannot cross so long as he is subject to the
body; yet Consciousness soars farther, quite pure in an ennui with­
out beings or objects.No longer suffering, superior to the excuses
which invite dying, Consciousness forgets the man who supports
it. More unreal than a star glimpsed in some hallucination, it suggests
the condition of a sidereal pirouette - while on life's circumference
the soul promenades, meeting only itself over and over again, itself
and its impotence to answer the call of the Void.

The Sundays of Life
If Sunday afternoons were extended for months, where would
humanity get to, liberated from sweat, from the weight of the first
curse? The experiment would be worth the trouble. It is more than
likely that crime would become the sole diversion, that debauchery
would seem candor, shouting melody and jeers tenderness. The
sensation of time's immensity would make each second into an
intolerable torment, a sublime firing squad. In hearts imbued with
poetry would appear a blase cannibalism and a hyena's melancholy;
butchers and executioners would die out - of lethargy; churches
and brothels would split with sighs.

from itself. Out of all he has undertaken to be healed of himself, a
stranger disease has been constituted: his 'civilization' is merely the
effort to find remedies for an incurable - and coveted - state. The

Except for the ancient skeptics and the French moralists, it would
be hard to cite a single mind whose theories, secretly or explicitly,
do not tend to mold man. But he subsists unchanged, though he
has followed the parade of noble precepts, proposed to his curiosity,
offered to his ardor and to his uncertainty. Whereas all beings have
their place in nature, man remains a metaphysically straying creature,
lost in Life, a stranger to the Creation. No one has found a valid goal
for history; but everyone has proposed one; and in the pullulation
of gods so divergent and so fantastic, the notion of finality has been

The Key to Our Endurance
The man who managed, by an imagination overflowing with pity,
to record all the sufferings, to be contemporary with all the pain
and all the anguish of any given moment - such a man - supposing
he could ever exist - would be a monster of love and the greatest
victim in the history of the human heart. But it is futile to imagine
such an impossibility. We need merely proceed to an investigation
of ourselves, only undertake the archaeology of our alarms. If we
venture into the torment of the days, it is because nothing halts this
march except our pangs; those of others seem to us explicable and
capable of being transcended : we believe they suffer because they
lack sufficient will, courage, or lucidity. Each suffering, except ours,
seems to us legitimate or absurdly intelligible ; otherwise, mourning
would be the unique constant in the versatility of our sentiments.
But we wear only the mourning of ourselves. If we could under­
stand and love the infinity of agonies which languish around us, all
the lives which are hidden deaths, we should require as many hearts

27

A Short History of Decay

as there are suffering beings.And if we had a miraculously

present

memory which sustained the totality of our past pains, we should
succumb beneath such a burden.Lift is possible only by the deficiencies

of our imagination and our memory.
We derive our power from our forgetting and from our incapacity
to conceive of the plurality of simultaneous fates. No one could
sur vive the instantaneous comprehenSion of universal grief, each
heart being stirred only for a certain quantity of sufferings. There
are something like material limits to our endurance; yet the expan­
sion of each pang reaches and occasionally exceeds such limits: this
is too often the source of our ruin.Whereupon the impression that
each misery, each disappointment is infinite. Indeed they are, but
only for us, for the limits of our own heart; and if the latter had the
dimensions of space itself, our ills would be more spacious still,
since every pain replaces the world, and for each unhappiness we
require another universe. Reason vainly strives to show us the
infinitesimal proportions of our disasters; it fails, confronted with
our penchant for cosmogonic proliferation.Thus true madness is
never due to chance or to the disasters of the brain, but to the false
conception of space the heart creates for itself . . .

Annihilation by Deliverance
A doctrine of salvation has meaning only if we start from the equa­

tion 'existence equals suffering.' It is neither a sudden realization
nor a series of reasonings which leads us to this equation, but the
unconscious elaboration of our every moment, the contribution of

all our experiences, minute or crucial. W hen we carry germs of
disappOintments and a kind of thirst to see them develop, the desire
that the world should undermine our hopes at each step multiplies
the voluptuous verifications of the disease. The arguments come
later; the doctrine is constructed: there still remains only the danger
of 'wisdom.' But, suppose we do not want to be free of suffering
nor to conquer our contradictions and conflicts - what if we prefer

28

Directions for Decomposition

the nuances of the incomplete and an affective dialectic to the

ness of a

even­

sublime impasse? Salvation ends everything; and ends us.

Who, once saved, dares still call himself alive? We really live only by
the refusal to be delivered from suffering and by a kind of religious
temptation of irreligiosity. Salvation haunts only assassins and saints,
those who have killed or transcended the creature; the rest wallow
- dead drunk - in imperfection . . .
The mistake of every doctrine of deliverance is to suppress
poetry, climate of the incomplete. The poet would betray himself
if he aspired to be saved: salvation is the death of song, the negation
of art and of the mind. How to feel integral with a conclusion? We
can refine, we can farm our sufferings, but by what means can we
free ourselves from them without

suspending ourselves?

Docile to

malediction, we exist only insofar as we suffer. A soul enlarges and
perishes only by as much

insupportable as it assumes.

The Abstract Venom
Even our vague ills, our diffuse anxieties, degenerating into physiol­
ogy, should by a converse impulse be restored to the maneuvers of
the intelligence . If we raised ennui - tautological perception of the
world, the dull ripple of duration - to the dignity of a deductive
elegy, if we offered it the temptation of a glamorous sterility? With­
out resorting to an order superior to the soul, the soul collapses into
the flesh - and physiology becomes the last word of our philosophic
stupors. To transpose immediate poisons into intellectual currency,
to make an instrument out of our palpable corruption, or else to
mask the impurity of every sentiment and sensation by norms is a
pursuit of elegance necessary to the mind, next to which the soul
- that pathetic hyena - is merely profound and sinister. The mind

in itself can be only supeificial, its nature being uniquely concerned

with the arrangement of conceptual events and not with their
implications in the spheres they SignifY. Our states interest it only
insofar as they are transposable. Thus melancholia emanates from

29

A Short History of Decay

our viscera and j oins the cosmic void; but the mind adopts melan­
cholia only filtered of what attaches it to the fragility of the senses;
the mind interprets it; refined, melancholia becomes point of view:
departmental melancholia. Theory lies in wait and seizes upon our
venoms, and renders them less noxious. It is a degradation from
above, the mind-as-amateur of pure intoxications - since it is the
enemy of intensities.

The Consciousness of Misery

Everything conspires, elements and actions alike, to harm you. Arm
yourself in disdain, isolate yourself in a fortress of disgust, dream
of superhuman indifference? The echoes of time would persecute
you in your ultimate absences . . . When nothing can keep you from
bleeding, ideas themselves turn red or encroach on each other like
rumors. There is no specific in our pharmacies against existence;
nothing but minor remedies for braggarts. But where is the antidote
for lucid despair, perfectly articulated, proud, and sure? All of us are
miserable, but how many know it? The consciousness of misery is
too serious a disease to figure in an arithmetic of agonies or in the
catalogues of th p Tnrnr::lhlp Tt hpHt!le� the F!"es tige of hell, :l!!d
converts the slaughterhouses of time into idyls. What sin have you
committed to be born, what crime to exist? Your suffering like your
fate is without motive. To suffer, truly to suffer, is to accept the
invasion of ills without the excuse of causality, as a favor of demented
nature, as a negative miracle . . .

act of knowledge at the moment when, in the silence of reflexes, a
macabre shudder isolated the perception of its object. How many
disgusts or nostalgias have we had to accumulate in order to waken
at the end alone, tragically superior to the evidence! A forgotten
sigh has made us take a step outside the immediate; a banal fatigue
has alienated us from a landscape or a person; diffuse moans have
separated us from sweet or timid innocences. The sum of these
accidental distances constitutes - ledger of our days and nights - the
gap which distinguishes us from the world, and which the mind
strives to reduce and to restore to our fragile proportions. But the
creation of each lassitude makes itself felt: where now to seek for

Is it possible that the same meaning lives and dies in the verbal
ramifications of an identical stock? Is it conceivable that such diverse
peoples experience nostalgia in the same way?
The man who struggles to find the formula for the disease of the
distant becomes the victim of a rickety architecture . To get back to
the source of these expressions of the vague, we must make an
affective regression toward their essence, must drown in the inef­
fable and emerge from it with our concepts in tatters. Once our
theoretical assurance and our pride in the intelligible is lost, we can
try to understand everything, to understand everything

for itself.

Then we manage to rej oice in the inexpressible, to spend our days

mourning . . .
To live in expectation, in what is not yet, is to accept the stimulat­
ing disequilibrium implied by the very notion of foture. Every
nostalgia is a transcendence of the present. Even in the form of
regret, it assumes a dynamic character: we want to force the past,
we want to act retroactively, to protest against the irreversible . Life
has a content only in the violation of time. The obsession of else­
where is the impossibility of the moment; and this impossibility is
nostalgia itself.
That the French should have refused to feel and above all to
cultivate the imperfection of the indefinite is certainly suggestive.
In a collective form, this disease does not exist in France : what the

French call cafard has no metaphysical quality and ennui is managed

Directionsfor Decomposition
singularly. The French repel all complacency toward the Possible;
their language itself eliminates any complicity with its dangers. Is
there any other nation which finds itself more at ease in the world,
for which being

chez soi

has more meaning and more weight, for

which immanence offers more attractions?
In order to desire something else

fundamentally,

we must b e

stripped o f space and time, w e must live i n a minimum of relation­
ship with a site, a moment. The reason the history of France offers
so few discontinuities is that fidelity to its essence, which flatters
our inclination to perfection and disappoints the craving for the
incomplete which a tragic vision implies. The only contagious thing
in France is lUCidity, the horror of being fooled, of being the victim
of anything. This is why a Frenchman accepts a risk only when he
is fully conscious of it; he

wants to be fooled; he bandages his eyes;

unconscious heroism rightly seems to him a lapse of taste, an inel­
egant sacrifice . But life's brutal ambiguity requires the triumph of
the impulse, and not of the will, to be a corpse, to be metaphysically
fooled.
If the French have burdened nostalgia with too much clarity, if they
have stripped it of a certain intimate and dangerous glamor, Sehnsucht,
on the other hand, exhausts whatever is insoluble about it in the
conflicts of the German soul, torn between Heimat and Infinity.
How could it find satisfaction? On one side, the longing to be
plunged into the undifferentiation of heart and hearth; on the other,
to keep absorbing space in an unslaked desire . And since extent
offers no limits, and since with it grows the penchant for new
wanderings, the goal retreats according to the progress made.
Whence the exotic taste, the passion for j ourneys, the delectation
in landscape as landscape, the lack of inner form, the tortuous depth
at once seductive and disheartening. There is no solution to the
tension between

Heimat

and Infinity: for it is to be rooted and

uprooted at one and the same time, and to have been unable to find
a compromise between the fireside and the far-off . . . Imperialism,
deadly constant in its ultimate essence - what is it but the political
and vulgarly concrete translation of

Sehnsucht?

33

A Short History of Decay

We cannot overemphasize the historical consequences of certain
inner approximations. Now, nostalgia is one of these; it keeps us
from resting in existence or in the absolute; it forces us to drift in
the indistinct, to lose our foundations, to live uncovered in time .
To be torn from the earth, exiled in duration, cut off from one's
immediate roots, is to long for a reintegration in the original sources
dating from before the separation and the severance. Nostalgia is
precisely to feel eternally distant from chez soi; and, outside the
luminous proportions of Ennui, and outside of the contradictory
postulation of Heimat and Infinity, it takes the form of the return
to the finite, to the immediate, to a terrestrial and maternal appeal.
Like the mind, the heart creates utopias: and of them all, the stran­
gest is the utopia of a natal universe, where we rest from ourselves,
a universe that is the cosmic pillow of all our lassitudes.
In nostalgic aspiration we do not want something palpable, but
a kind of abstract warmth, heterogeneous to time and close to a
paradisiac presentiment. Whatever does not accept existence as such
borders on theology. Nostalgia is merely a sentimental theology, in
which the Absolute is built with the elements of desire, in which
God is Indeterminacy elaborated by languor.

Solitude - Schism of the Heart

We are doomed to perdition each time life does not reveal itself as
a miracle, each time the moment no longer moans in a supernatu­
ral shudder. How renew that sensation of plenitude, those seconds
of delirium, those volcanic flashes, those wonders of fervor which
reduce God to an accident of our clay? By what subterfuge revive
that explosion in which even music seems superficial, the castoff of
our inner organ?
It is not in our power to remember the seizures which made us
coincide with the start of movement, made us masters of the first
moment of time and instantaneous artisans of the Creation. We

34

Directionsfor Decomposition
perceive no more of Creation than its destitution, the grim reality:
we live in order to unlearn ecstasy. And it is not the miracle which
determines our tradition and our substance, but the void of a
universe frustrated of its flames, engulfed in its own absences,
exclusive obj ect of our rumination: a lonely universe before a lonely
heart, each predestined to disjoin and to exasperate each other in
the antithesis. When the solitude is intensified to the point of consti­
tuting not so much our

datum

as our sole faith, we cease to b e

integral with the whole: heretics of existence, we are banished from
the community of the living, whose sole virtue is to wait, gasping,
for something which is not death. But we , emancipated from the
fascination of such waiting, rejected from the ecumenicity of illu­
sion - we are the most heretical sect of all, for our soul itself is born
in heresy.
('When the soul is in a state of grace, its beauty is so high and so
admirable that it far surpasses all that is beautiful

in nature,

and

delights the eyes of God and the Angels' - Ignatius Loyola .
I have sought t o settle i n a n ordinary grace; I have tried t o liqui­
date all interrogations and vanish in an ignorant light, in any light
disdainful of the intellect. But how attain to the sigh of felicity
superior to problems, when no 'beauty' illuminates you, and when
God and the Angels are blind?
Once, when Teresa, p atron s aint of Spain and of your soul,
prescribed a course of temptations and intoxications, the transcend­

cold heart the fevers of Avila are extinguished forever.
By what peculiarity of fate do certain beings, having reached the
point where they might coincide with a faith, retreat to follow a
path which leads them only to themselves - and hence nowhere? Is
it out of fear that once installed in grace they might lose there their
distinct virtues? Each man develops at the expense of his depths,
each man is a mystic who denies himself: the earth is inhabited by
various forms of grace

manque, by trampled mysteries.)

Twilight Thinkers
Athens was dying, and with it the worship of knowledge . The great
systems had run their cours e : limited to the conceptual realm, they
rejected the intervention of torments, the pursuit of deliverance
and of inordinate meditation upon suffering. The declining city,
having permitted the conversion of human disasters into theory, no
matter what - sneeze or sudden death - was supplanting the old
problems. The obsession with remedies marks the end of a civiliza­
tion; the search for s alvation, that of a philosophy. Plato and
Aristotle had yielded to such preoccupations only for the sake of
equilibrium; after them, such concerns prevailed in every domain.
Rome, waning, took from Athens only the echoes of its deca­
dence and the reflections of its collapse. When the Greeks exercised
their doubts throughout the Empire, the latter's downfall and that
of philosophy were virtually consummated. All questions seeming
legitimate, the superstition of formal limits no longer prevented the
debauch of arbitrary curiosities. The infiltration of epicureanism
and of stoicism was easy: ethics replaced the abstract structures,
bastardized reason became the irlstrumcnt of praxis . III tll<: �tlccl:s
of Rome, with various recipes for 'happiness,' swarmed the epicur­
eans and the stoics, experts in wisdom, noble charlatans appearing
at the periphery of philosophy to treat an incurable and generalized
lassitude. But their therapeutics l acked the mythology and the
strange anecdotes which, in the universal enervation, were to consti­
tute the vigor of a religion unconcerned with nuance, a religion
originating more remotely than they. Wisdom is the last word of
an expiring civilization , the nimbus of historic twilights, fatigue
transfigured into a vision of the world, the last tolerance before the
advent of other, newer gods - and of barbarism; wisdom, what we
call sagesse, is also a vain attempt at melody among the environing
death rattles . For the Sage - theoretician of a limpid death, hero
of indifference , and symbol of the last stage of philosophy, of its

Directions for Decomposition
degenerescence and its vacuity - has solved the problem of his own
death . . . and has thereupon suppressed all problems. Provided with
rarer absurdities, he is a limit-case, which we encounter in extreme
periods as an exceptional confirmation of the general pathology.
Finding ourselves at a point symmetrical to the agony of the
ancient world, a victim of the same sicknesses and under similarly
ineluctable charms, we see the great systems destroyed by their
limited perfection. For us too, everything becomes the substance of
a philosophy w ithout dignity and w ithout rigor . . . Thought's
impersonal fate has been scattered into a thousand souls, a thousand
humiliations of the Idea . . . Not Leibnitz, Kant, or Hegel are of any
help to us any longer. We have come with our own death to the
doors of philosophy: rotting on their hinges, having nothing more
to protect, they open of their own accord . . . and anything becomes
a philosophical

subject.

Paragraphs are replaced by cries: the conse­

quence is a philosophy of the fundus

whose intimacy will

be reconnoitered in the appearances of history and the surfaces of

We too seek 'happiness: either by frenzy or by disdain: to scorn
it is not yet to forget it, and to reject it is a way of retaining it; we too
seek 'salvation: if only by wanting nothing to do with it. And if we
are the negative heroes of an overripe age, thereby we are its contem­

poraries:

to betray one's age or to be its fervent adept expresses - in

an apparent contradiction - one and the same act of participation.
The lofty defeats, the subtle decrepitudes, the aspirations to timeless
halos - all leading to wisdom - who would not recognize them in
himself ? W ho does not feel the right to assert everything in the void
around him, before the world vanishes in the dawn of

an

absolute

or of a new negation? A god is always threatening on the horizon.
We are in the margin of philosophy. since we consent to its end. Let
us conduct ourselves so that the god does not settle in our thoughts,
let us still keep our doubts, the appearances of equilibrium, and the
temptation of immanent destiny. any arbitrary and fantastic aspira­
tion being preferable to the inflexible truths. We change cures,
finding none effective, none valid, because we have faith neither in

the peace we seek nor in the pleasures we pursue. Versatile sages,
we are the stoics and epicureans of modern Romes . . .

Resources of Self-Destruction
Born in a prison, with burdens on our shoulders and our thoughts,
we could not reach the end of a single day if the possibilities of ending
it all did not incite us to begin the next day all over again . . . Irons
and the unbreathable air of this world strip us of everything, except
the freedom to kill ourselves; and this freedom grants us a strength
and a pride to triumph over the loads which overwhelm us.
What gift is more mysterious than being able to do what we will
with ourselves and to refuse to do it? Consolation by a possible
suicide widens into infinite space this realm where we are suffocat­
ing. The notion of destroying ourselves, the multiplicity of means
for doing so, their ease and their proximity delight us and fill us with
dread; for there is nothing simpler and more terrible than the action

by which we decide irrevocably upon ourselves. In a single second
we do away with all seconds; God himself could not do as much.
But, braggart demons, we postpone our end: how could we renounce
the display of o'..!!" freedo!!l, the �ho'.'! of o'..!!" p!"ide? . . .
The man who has never imagined his own annihilation, who has
not anticipated recourse to the rope, the bullet, poison, or the sea,
is a degraded galley slave or a worm crawling upon the cosmic
carrion. This world can take everything from us, can forbid us
everything, but no one has the power to keep us from wiping
ourselves out. Every tool offers its help, every abyss invites us in;
but all our instincts oppose the act. This contradiction develops an
insoluble conflict in the mind. When we begin to reflect upon life,
to discover in it an infinity of emptiness, our instincts have already
turned themselves into guides and middlemen of our acts; they rein
in the flight of our inspiration and the pliability of our detachment.

If, at the moment of our birth, we were as conscious as we are at
the end of adolescence, it is more than likely that at the age of five

Directionsfor Decomposition
suicide would be a habitual phenomenon or even a question of
honor. But we wake too late: we have against us the years nourished
solely by the presence of the instincts, which can be only stupefied
by the conclusions to which our meditations and our disappoint­
ments lead. And they react; yet, having acquired the consciousness
of our freedom, we are masters of a resolve all the more tempting
in that we do not take advantage of it. It makes us endure the days
and, what is more, the nights; we are no longer poor, or crushed by
adversity: we possess supreme resources. And even when we never
exploit them, when we expire in the usual way, we have had a treas­
ure in our very abandonments: what greater wealth than the suicide
each of us bears within himself?
If the religions have forbidden us to die by our own hand, it is
because they saw that such practices set an example of insubordin­
ation which humiliated temples and gods alike . The Council of
Orleans regarded suicide as a sin more grievous than murder, for
the murderer can always repent, be saved, whereas the man who
has taken his own life has passed beyond the limits of salvation. But
the act of suicide originates in a radical formula of salvation. Is not
nothingness the equal of eternity? The solitary being has no need
to declare war on the universe - he sends the ultimatum to himself.
He no longer aspires

to be forever,

if in an incomparable action he

has been absolutely himself. He rejects heaven and earth as he rej ects
himself. At least he will have achieved a plenitude of freedom inac­
cessible to the man who keeps looking for it in the future .

.

.

No church, no civil institution has as yet invented a single argu­
ment valid against suicide. What answer is there to the man who
can no longer endure life? No one is qualified to take another's
burdens upon himself. And what power does dialectic have against
the assault of irrefutable despairs and against a thousand unconsoled
manifestations? Suicide is one of man's distinctive characteristics,
one of his discoveries; no animal is capable of it, and the angels have
scarcely guessed its existence; without it, human reality would be
less curious, less picturesque: we should lack a strange climate and
a series of deadly possibilities which have their aesthetic value, if

39

A

only to introduce into tragedy certain new solutions and a variety
of denouements.
The sages of antiquity, who put themselves to death as a proof
of their maturity, had created a discipline of suicide which the
moderns have unlearned. Doomed to an uninspired agony, we are
neither authors of our extremities nor arbiters of our adieux; the end
is no longer our end: we lack the excellence of a unique initiative - by
which we might ransom an insipid and talentless life, as we lack the
sublime cynicism, the ancient splendor of an art of dying. Habitues
of despair, complacent corpses, we all outlive ourselves and die only
to fulfill a futile formality. It is as if our life were attached to itself
only to postpone the moment when we could get rid of it.

The Reactionary Angels
It is difficult to sit in judgment on the revolt of the least philo­
sophical of the angels without a tinge of sympathy, amazement,
and . . . blame. Injustice governs the universe. Everything which is
done and undone there bears the stamp of a filthy fragility, as if
matter were the fruit of a scandal at the core of nothingness. Each
hf'ing feeds on the agony of some other; thf" momf"nts rmh likl'
vampires upon time's anemia; the world is a receptacle of sobs

.

.

.

In this slaughterhouse, to fold one's arms or to draw one's sword
are equally vain gestures. No proud frenzy can shake space to its
foundations or ennoble men's souls. Triumphs and failures follow
one another according to an unknown law named

destiny,

a name

to which we resort when, philosophically unprovided for, our
sojourn here on earth or anywhere seems insoluble to us, a kind of
curse to endure, senseless and undeserved.

Destiny - favorite

word

in the vocabulary of the vanquished . . . Greedy for a nomenclature

of the Irremediable, we seek relief in verbal invention, in lights
suspended over our disasters. Words are charitable: their frail reality
deceives and consoles us . . .
Thus 'destiny,' which can will nothing, is what has

40

willed

what

Directions for Decomposition
happens to us . . . Infatuated with the Irrational as the sole mode
of explanation, we watch it tip the scale of our fate, which weighs
only negative elements. Where find the pride to provoke the forces
which have so decreed, and what is more, are not to be held respon­
sible for this decree? Against whom wage the struggle, and where
lead the assault when injustice haunts the air of our lungs, the space
of our thoughts, the silence and the stupor of the stars? Our revolt
is as ill conceived as the world which provokes it. How take it on
ourselves to right wrongs when, like Don Quixote on his deathbed,
we have lost - madness at its end, exhausted - vigor and illusion to
confront the highroads, combats, and defeats? And how regain the
energy of that seditious angel who, still at time's start, knew noth­
ing of that pestilential wisdom in which our impulses asphyxiate?
Where find enough verve and presumption to stigmatize the herd
of the other angels, while here on earth to follow their colleague is
to cast oneself still lower, while men's injustice imitates God's, and
all rebellion sets the soul against infinity and breaks it there? The
anonymous angels - huddled under their ageless wings, eternally
victors and vanquished in God, numb to the deadly curiosities,
dreamers parallel to the earthly griefs - who would dare to cast the
first stone at them and, in defiance, divide their sleep? Revolt, the
pride of downfall, takes its nobility only from its uselessness:
sufferings awaken it and then abandon it; frenzy exalts it and disap­
pointment denies it . . . Revolt cannot have a meaning in a non-valid
universe . . .
(In this world nothing is in its place, beginning with this world itself.
We must therefore not be surprised by the spectacle of human
injustice . It is equally futile to refuse or to accept the social order:
we must endure its changes for the better or the worse with a
despairing conformism, as we endure birth, love, the weather, and
death. Decomposition presides over the laws of life: closer to our
dust than inanimate objects to theirs, we succumb before them and
rush upon our destiny under the gaze of the apparently indestruct­
ible stars. But they themselves will crumble in a universe which only

41

A Short History of Decay
our heart takes seriously, later expiating its lack of irony by terrible
lacerations . . .
No one can correct God's injustice or that of men: every action
is merely a special, apparently organized case of the original Chaos.
We are swept on by a whirlwind which dates back to the dawn of
time; and if this whirlwind has assumed the aspect of an order, it is
only the better to do away with us . . . )

The Concern for Decency
Under the goad of pain, the flesh awakens; lucid and lyrical
substance, it sings its dissolution. So long as it was indistinguishable
from nature, it rested in the oblivion of elements: the self had not
yet seized upon it. Suffering matter frees itself from gravitation, no
longer participates in the universe, isolates itself from the somnolent
sum; for pain, an agent of separation, the active principle of indi­
viduation, denies the pleasures of a statistical destiny.
The truly solitary being is not the man who is abandoned by
men, but the man who suffers in their midst, who drags his desert
through the marketplace and deploys his talents as a smiling leper,

in the old days, knew nothing of duplicity, had nothing to hide : they

conversed only with their own solitude . . .
Of all the bonds which link us to things, there is not one which
fails to slacken and dissolve under the influence of suffering, which
frees us from everything except the obsession of ourselves and
the sensation of being irrevocably

individual.

Suffering is solitude

hypostatized as essence. By what means, then, communicate with
others except by the prestidigitation of lying? For if we were not
jugglers, if we had not learned the artifices of a knowing charlatan­
ism, if indeed we were

sincere

to the point of shamelessness or

tragedy - our underground worlds would vomit up oceans of gall,
in which it would be a point of honor for us to vanish: thereby
we should flee the unseemliness of so much grotesquerie and

Directionsfor Decomposition
sublimity. At a certain degree of misery, all frankness becomes
indecent. Job stopped just in time : one step further, and neither God
nor his friends would have answered him again.

Gamut of the Void
I have seen one man pursue this goal, another that one; I have seen
men fascinated by disparate obj e cts, under the spell of dreams and
plans at once vile and indefinable . Analyzing each case in isolation
in order to penetrate the reasons for so much fervor squandered, I
have realized the non-meaning of all action and all effort. Is there a
single life which is not impregnated with life-giving errors, a single
clear, transparent life without humiliating roots, without invented
motives, without myths emerging from desires? Where is the action
pure of all utility: sun abhorring incandescence, angel in a universe
without faith, or idle worm in a world abandoned to immortality?
I have tried to protect myself against men, to react against their
madness, to discern its source; I have listened and I have seen - and
I have been afraid - afraid of acting for the same motives or for any
motive whatever, of believing in the same ghosts or in any other
ghost, of letting myself be engulfed by the same intoxications or by
some other . . . afraid, in short, of raving in common and of expir­
ing in a horde of ecstasies. I knew that by separating from someone,
I was dispossessed of a fallacy, I was deprived of the illusion I was

leaving him . . . His feverish words revealed him the captive of an
evidence absolute for him and absurd for me; on contact with his
vacuity, I stripped myself of mine . . . Whom can we adhere to
without the feeling of deception - without blushing? We can justifY
only the man who practices, in.fUll awareness, the irrational necessary
to every action, and who embellishes with no dream the fiction to
which he surrenders himself, as we can admire only a hero who dies
without conviction, all the more ready for sacrifice in that he has
seen through it. As for lovers, they would be hateful if among their
grimaces the presentiment of death did not hover, caressing . . . It
is disturbing to think that we carry our secret - our illusion - into
the grave, that we have not survived the mysterious mistake that
vivified our every breath, that, except for the skeptics and whores
among us, all founder in falsehood because they fail to divine the
equivalence, in nullity, of triumphs and truths.
I wanted to suppress in myself the reasons men invoke in order
to exist, in order to act. I wanted to become unspeakably normal
- and here I am in dazed confusion, on a footing with fools, and as
empty as they.

Certain Mornings
Regret not to be Atlas, not to be able to shrug my shoulders and

Rage takes the oppo­

site path of cosmogony. By what mysteries do we wake, certain
mornings, with the thirst to demolish the whole of creation, inert
and animate alike? When the devil drowns himself in our veins,
when our ideas turn convulsive and our desires cleave the light, the
elements catch fire and consume themselves, while our fingers sift
their ashes.
What nightmares have we sustained for nights on end to wake
up in the mornings enemies of the sun? Must we liquidate ourselves
to put an end to everything? What complicity, what bonds extend

us into an intimacy with time? Life would be intolerable without

44

Directions for Decomposition
the forces which deny it. Masters of a possible exit, of the

idea

of

an escape, we might readily abolish ourselves and, at the apex of
delirium, expectorate this universe.

maceration, and fingernails furrowing the flesh, with the consolations
of a spectacle of blood, no longer figure among our therapeutic
methods. It follows that we are all sick, and that each of us would
require a Sahara in order to scream our lungs out, or the shores of
a wild and elegiac sea in order to mingle with its fierce lamentations
our even fiercer ones. Our paroxysms require the context of a
parodic sublimity, of an apoplectic infinity, the vision of a hanging
where the firmament would serve as a gallows to our carcasses and
to the elements.)

Militant Mourning
All truths are against us. But we go on living, because we accept
them in themselves, because we refuse to draw the consequences.
Where is the man who has translated - in his behavior - a single
conclusion of the lessons of astronomy, of biology, and who has
decided never to leave his bed again out of rebellion or humility in
the face of the sidereal distances or the natural phenomena? Has
pride ever been conquered by the evidence of our unreality? And
who was ever bold enough to do nothing because every action is

45

A Short History of Decay
senseless in infinity? The sciences prove our nothingness. But who
has grasped their ultimate teaching? Who has become a hero of
total sloth? No one folds his arms: we are busier than the ants and
the bees. Yet if an ant, if a bee - by the miracle of an idea or by some
temptation of singularity - were to isolate herself in the anthill or
the hive, if she contemplatedfrom outside the spectacle of her labors,
would she still persist in her pains?
Only the rational animal has been able to learn nothing from his
philosophy: he locates himself apart - and perseveres nonetheless
in the same errors of effective appearance and void reality. Seen
from outside, from any Archimedean point, life - with all its beliefs
- is no longer possible, nor even conceivable . We can act only against
the truth. Man starts over again every day, in spite of everything he
knows, against everything he knows. He has extended this ambigu­
ity to the point of vice: perspicacity is in mourning, but - strange
contagion - this very mourning is active; thus we are led into a
funeral procession to the Last Judgment; thus, out of the ultimate
rest itself, out of history's final silence, we have made an activity:
the staging of the agony, the need for dynamism even in the death­
rattles . . .

lost, in their rushed cadence, the atemporal consciousness.
By all evidence we are in the world to do nothing; but instead of
nonchalantly promenading our corruption, we exude our sweat and

the fever inherent in any decomposition.

Immunity to Renunciation
Everything which deals with eternity inevitably turns into a
commonplace. The world ends by accepting any revelation and
resigns itself to any shudder, provided that a formula is found for
it. The notion of universal futility - more dangerous than any
scourge - has been debased into the obvious: everyone acknowl­
edges as much, and no one behaves accordingly. The terror of an
ultimate truth has been tamed; once it turns into a refrain, men no
longer think about it, for they have learned by heart a thing which,
merely glimpsed, should cast them into the abyss or salvation. The
vision of Time's nullity has begotten saints and poets, and the
despairs of a few solitaries, infatuated with anathema . . .
This vision is no news to the crowd; the crowd continually asks:

one saint, not one poet more . . . If the crowd conformed to a single
one of these refrains, the face of the world would be transformed.
But eternity - appearing from an anti-vital thought - cannot be a
human reflex without danger for the performance of actions : it
becomes a commonplace, so that we can forget it by a mechanical
repetition. Sanctity is a risk like poetry. Men say 'everything passes'
- but how many grasp the bearing of this terrifYing banality? How
many flee life, celebrate or bewail it? Who is not imbued with the
conviction that all is vanity? But who dares confront the conse­
quences? The man with a metaphysical vocation is rarer than a
monster - and yet each man contains the potential elements of this
vocation. It was enough for one Hindu prince to see a cripple, an
old man, and a corpse

to understand everything;

we see them and

understand nothing, for nothing changes in our life. We cannot
renounce anything; yet the evidences of vanity are in our reach.
Invalids of hope, we are still waiting; and life is only the hypostatiza­
tion of waiting. We wait for everything - even Nothingness - rather

than be reduced to an eternal suspension, to a condition of neutral
divinity, of a corpse. Thus the heart, which has made the Irreparable
into an axiom, still hopes for surprises from it. Humanity lives in
love with the events which deny it . . .

The World's E quilibrium

The apparent symmetry of joys and pains has nothing to do with
their equitable distribution: it results from the injustice which strikes
certain individuals, thereby forcing them to compensate by their
despondency for the others' unconcern. To endure the consequences
of their actions, or to be saved from them - such is the lot of men.
This discrimination is effected without any criterion: it is a fatality,
an absurd apportionment, a fantastic selection. No one can elude
the condemnation to happiness or misery, nor the innate sentence
at the preposterous tribunal whose decision extends between the
spermatozoon and the sepulcher.
Some men pay for all their joys, expiate all their pleasures, are
accountable for all their intervals of oblivion: they will never be
indebted for a single moment of happiness. For them a thousand
acrimonies have crowned a shlldoFr of pleasure as if they had no
right to acknowledged contentments, as if their abandonment
endangered the world's bestial equilibrium . . . Were they happy in
some landscape? - they will regret it in imminent disappointments;
were they proud in their plans and their dreams? - they will soon
wake, as from a utopia, corrected by all-too-positive sufferings.
Thus there are sacrificed men who pay for the unconsciousness of
others, who expiate not only their own happiness but that of strangers.
Thus equilibrium is restored; the proportion of joys and pains becomes
harmonious. If an obscure universal prinCiple has decreed that you
belong to the order of victims, you will end your days stamping
underfoot the speck of paradise you hid within yourself, and whatever
impulse gleamed in your eyes and your dreams will be sullied by the
impurity of time, matter, and men. You will have a dungheap for

Directionsfor Decomposition
pedestal, for tribune a rack and thumbscrew. You will be worthy of
no more than a leprous glory and a crown of spit. Try to walk beside
those entitled to everything, to whom all paths

are

open? But dust

and ashes themselves will rise up to bar you from the exits of time
and the evasions of dreams. Whatever direction you take, your steps
will be mired, your voices will proclaim only the hymns of mud, and
over your bent heads, your heavy hearts, in which only self-pity dwells,

will pass no more than the breath of the happy, blessed toys of a
nameless irony as little to blame as you are.

Farewell to Philosophy
I turned away from philosophy when it became impossible to discover
in Kant any human weakness, any authentic accent of melancholy;
in Kant and in all the philosophers. Compared to music, mysticism,
and poetry, philosophical activity proceeds from a diminished impulse
and a suspect depth, prestigious only for the timid and the tepid.
Moreover, philosophy - impersonal anxiety, refuge among anemic
ideas - is the recourse of all who would elude the corrupting exuber­
ance of life . Almost all the philosophers came to a good end: that is
the supreme argument against philosophy. Even Socrates' death has
nothing tragic about it: it is a misunderstanding, the end of a peda­
gogue - and if Nietzsche foundered, it was as a poet and visionary:
he expiated his ecstasies and not his arguments.
We cannot elude existence by explanations, we can only endure
it, love or hate it, adore or dread it, in that alternation of happiness
and horror which expresses the very rhythm of being, its oscillations,
its dissonances, its bright or bitter vehemences.
Exposed by surprise or necessity to an irrefutable defeat, who
does not raise his hands in prayer then, only to let them fall emptier
still for the answers of philosophy? It would seem that its mission is
to protect us as long as fate's neglect allows us to proceed on the
brink of chaos, and to abandon us as soon as we are forced to plunge
over the edge . And how could it be otherwise, when we see how

49

A

Short History of Decay

little of humanity's suffering has passed into its philosophy? The
philosophic exercise is not fruitful; it is merely honorable. We are
always philosophers with

impunity: a metier without fate which pours

voluminous thoughts into our neutral and vacant hours, the hours
refractory to the Old Testament, to Bach, and to Shakespeare. And
have these thoughts materialized into a single page that is equivalent
to one of Job's exclamations, of Macbeth's terrors, or the altitude of
one of Bach's cantatas? We do not

argue the

universe ; we

express it.

And philosophy does not express it. The real problems begin only
after having ranged or exhausted it, after the last chapter of a huge
tome which prints the final period as an abdication before the
Unknown, in which all our moments are rooted and with which we
must struggle because it is naturally more immediate, more impor­
tant than our daily bread. Here the philosopher leaves us: enemy of
disaster, he is sane as reason itself, and as prudent. And we remain
in the company of an old plague victim, of a poet learned in every
lunacy, and of a musician whose sublimity transcends the sphere of
the heart. We begin to live authentically only where philosophy ends,
at its wreck, when we have understood its terrible nullity, when we
have understood that it was futile to resort to it, that it is no

What advantage is it to know that the nature of being consists in
the 'will to live, ' in 'idea,' or in the whim of God or of Chemistry?
A mere proliferation of words, subtle displacements of meanings.
What

is

loathes the verbal embrace, and our inmost experience

reveals us nothing beyond the privileged and inexpressible moment.
Moreover, Being itself is only a pretension of Nothingness.
We define only out of despair. We must have a formula , we must
even have many, if only to give justification to the mind and a fa�ade
to the void.
Neither concept nor ecstasy are functional. When music plunges
us into the 'inwardness' of being, we rapidly return to the surface: the
effects of the illusion scatter and our knowledge admits its nullity.
The things we touch and those we conceive are as improbable

50

Directionsfor Decomposition
as our sense and our reason; we are sure only in our verbal universe,
manageable at will - and ineffe ctual. Being is mute and the mind is
garrulous. This is called

knOwing.

The philosophers' Originality comes down to inventing terms.
Since there are only three or four attitudes by which to confront the
world - and about as many ways of dying - the nuances which
multiply and diversify them derive from no more than the choice
of words, bereft of any metaphysical range.
We are engulfed in a pleonastic universe, in which the questions
and answers amount to the same thing.)

From Saint to Cynic
Mockery has degraded everything to the rank of a pretext, except for
the Sun and Hope, except for the two conditions of life: the world's
center and the heart's, the one dazzling, the other invisible. A skeleton,
warming in the sun and hoping, would be more vigorous than a
despairing Hercules weary of the light; a Being totally permeable to
Hope would be more powerful than God and more vital than Life .
Macbeth, 'aweary o f th e sun: i s the last o f creatures, true death not
being corruption but the disgust with our irradiation, the repulsion
for all that is a seed, for all that grows in the warmth of illusion.
Man has profaned the things which are born and die under the sun,
except for the sun; the things which are born and die in hope, except
for hope. Not having had the courage to go further, he has imposed

limits upon his cynicism. A cynic, who claims to be consistent, is a
cynic in words only; his gestures make him the most contradictory
being: no one can live after having decimated his superstitions. To
reach total cynicism would require an effort which is the converse of
sanctity's and at least as considerable; or else, imagine a saint who ,
having reached the pinnacle of his purification, discovers th e vanity o f
the trouble h e has taken - and the absurdity of God . . .
Such a monster of lucidity would change the data of life: he would
have the strength and the authority to question the very conditions

SI

A ShOTt History of Decay

of his existence; he would no longer be in danger of contradicting
himself; no human failing would then weaken his audacities; having
lost the religious respect we pay despite ourselves to our last illusions,
he would make a plaything of his heart, and of the sun . . .

Return to the Elements

If philosophy had made no progress since the pre-Socratics, there
would be no reason to complain. Exhausted by the jumble of
concepts, we end by realizing that our life is still lived out in the
elements out of which they constituted the world, that it is the earth,
fire, air, and water which condition us, that this rudimentary phys­
ics reveals the context of our ordeals and the principle of our
torments. Having complicated these few elementary data, we have
lost - fascinated by the decor and the structure of our theories - the
understanding of Destiny, which nonetheless, unchanged, is the
same as on the world's first day. Our existence reduced to its essence
continues to be a struggle against the eternal elements, a struggle
which our knowledge in no way alleviates. The heroes of every
epoch are no less wretched than those of Homer, and if they have
become characters. it is by losine vitality and erf'atn f'�� Hnw rnl l l cl
the results of the sciences change man's metaphysical position? And
what are the explorations of matter, the discoveries and the products
of analysis beside the vedic hymns and those melancholies of historic
dawn which crept into the world's anonymous poetry?
Since the most eloquent decadences edify us no further as to
unhappiness than the stammerings of a shepherd, and ultimately
there is more wisdom in the mockery of an idiot than in the inves­
tigations of the laboratories, is it not madness to pursue truth on
the paths of time - or in books? Lao-tse, reduced to a few texts, is
not more naive than we who have read everything. Profundity is
independent of knowledge. We translate to other levels the revela­
tions of the ages, or we exploit original intuitions by the latest
acquisitions of thought. Thus Hegel is a Heraclitus who has read

52

Directionsfor Decomposition
Kant; and our Ennui is an affective Eleaticism, the fiction of diversity
unmasked and exposed to the heart . . .

Subterfuges
Only those who live outside of art draw the ultimate consequences.
Suicide, sanctity, vice - so many forms of lack of talent. Direct or
disguised, confession by word, sound, or color halts the agglom­
eration of inner forces and weakens them by projecting them back
toward the world outside. It is a salutary diminution which makes
every act of creation into a coefficient of escape. But the man who
accumulates energies lives under pressure, a slave to his own
excesses; nothing keeps him from foundering in the absolute . . .
Authentic tragic existence is almost never to be found among
those who know how to manage the secret powers which exhaust
them; diminishing their soul by their work, where would they find
the energy to attain to the extremity of actions? A hero is fulfilled
in a proud modality of dying b ecause he lacked the faculty of
gradually extinguishing himself in verse. All heroism expiates - by
the genius of the heart - a defaulting talent; every hero is a b eing
without talent. And it is this deficiency which projects him forward
and enriches him, while those who have by creation impoverished
their inheritance of the unspeakable, are cast, as existences, into the
background, though their minds can be raised above all the rest.
A man eliminates himself from the rank of his kind by the
monastery or some other artifice - by morphine, masturbation, or
rum - whereas a form of expression might have saved him. But,
always present to himself, perfect possessor of his reserves and his
mistakes, b earing the sum of his life without the possibility of
diminishing it by the pretexts of art, invaded hy self he can be only

total in his gestures and his resolutions, he can draw only a conclu­
sion affecting him altogether; he cannot relish the extremes; he is
drowned in them ; and he actually drowns in vice, in God, or in his
own blood, whereas the cowardices of expression would have made

53

A

him retreat before the supreme. The man who
not act against himself; he knows only the

expresses himself does
temptation of ultimate

consequences. And the deserter is not the man who draws them,
but the man who scatters and divulges himself for fear lest, surren­
dered to himself, he will be ruined and wrecked.

Non-Resistance to Night
At first, we think we advance toward the light; then, wearied by an

aimless march, we lose our way: the earth, less and less secure , no
longer supports us; it opens under our feet. Vainly we should try to
follow a path toward a sunlit goal; the shadows mount within and
below us. No gleam to slow our descent: the abyss summons us,
and we lend an ear. Above still remains all we wanted to be, all that
has not had the power to raise us higher. And we , once in love with
the peaks, then disappointed by them, we end by fondling our fall,
we hurry to fulfill it, instruments of a strange execution, fascinated
by the illusion of reaching the limits of the darkness, the frontiers

of our nocturnal fate. Fear of the void transformed into a kind of
voluptuous joy, what luck to gainsay the sun! Infinity in reverse, god
that h egin s h ene<lth Ol l r h f'f'k f'c-st<l sy hf'forf' th f'

c-rf>vic-f's ()f hf>ing,

and thirst for a black halo, the Void is an inverted dream in which
we are engulfed.
If delirium becomes our law, let us wear a subterranean nimbus,
a crown in our fall. Dethroned from this world, let us carry its scepter
in order to honor the night with a new splendor.
(And yet this fall - but for some moments of posturing - is far from
being solemn and lyric. Habitually we sink into a nocturnal mud,
into a darkness quite as mediocre as the light . . . Life is merely a
torpor in chiaroscuro, an inertia among the gleams and shadows, a
caricature of that inward sun which makes us believe, illegitimately,
in our eminence over the rest of matter. Nothing proves that we are
more than nothing. In order to experience that continual expansion

54

Directions for Decomposition

in which we rival the gods, in which our fevers triumph over our
fears, we should have to remain at so high a temperature that it
would finish us off in a few days. But our illuminations are instant­
aneous; falls are our rule. Life is what decomposes at every moment;
it is a monotonous loss of light, an insipid dissolution in the dark­
ness, without scepters, without halos . . . )

Turning a Cold Shoulder to Time

Yesterday, today, tomorrow - these are servants' categories. For the
idle man, sumptuously settled in the Inconsolable, and whom every
moment torments, past, present, and future are merely variable
appearances of one and the same disease, identical in its substance,
inexorable in its insinuation, and monotonous in its persistence.
And this disease is coextensive with Being - it is Being.
I was, I am, or I shall he - a question of grammar and not of
existence. Fate - as a carnival of chronos - lends itself to conjugation,
but, stripped of its masks, is revealed to be as motionless and naked
as an epitaph. How can we grant more importance to the hour
which is than to the one which was or which will be? The contempt
in which servants live - and every man who adheres to time is a
servant - represents a true state of grace, an enchanted obscuration;
and this contempt - like a supernatural veil - covers the damnation
to which every action engendered by desire is exposed. But for the
disabused man of leisure, the pure fact of living, living pure of all
praxis, is a task so wearying, that to endure existence as such seems
to him an excessive occupation, an exhausting career - and every
gesture inordinate, impracticable, and repealed.

Two-Faced Freedom

Though the problem of freedom is insoluble, we can always argue
about it, always side with contingency or necessity . . . Our temper-

55

A Short History of Decay

aments and our prejudices facilitate an option which cuts short
and simplifies the problem without solving it. Whereas no theo­
retical construction manages to make it apparent to us to make
us experience its dense and contradictory reality, a privileged
intuition puts us at the very heart of freedom, despite all the argu­
ments invented against it. And we are afraid; we are afraid of the
enormity of the possible, not being prepared for a revelation so
huge and so sudden, for that dangerous benefit to which we aspired
and before which we retreat. What shall we do - accustomed to
chains and laws - in the face of an infinity of initiatives, of a
debauch of decisions? The seduction of the arbitrary alarms us.
If we can begin any action, if there are no limits to inspiration and
to our whims, how avoid our ruin in the intoxication of so much
power?
Consciousness, shaken by this revelation, interrogates itself and
trembles. Who, in a world where he can do anything, has not been
dizzied? The murderer makes a limitless use of his freedom, and
cannot resist the notion of his power. It is within the capacities of
each one of us to take another's life. If all those we have killed in
thought were to disappear for good, the earth would be depopu­
lated. We bear within us a reticent executioner, an unrealized
criminal. And those who lack the boldness to acknowlpd£;t' rhpir
homicidal tendencies murder in dreams, people their nightmares
with corpses. Before an absolute tribunal, only the angels would be
acquitted. For there has never been a human being who has not - at
least unconsciously - desired the death of another human being.
Each of us drags after him a cemetery of friends and enemies; and
it matters little whether this graveyard is relegated to the heart's
abyss or projected to the surface of our desires.
Freedom, conceived in its ultimate implications, raises the ques­
tion of our life or of others' lives; it involves the dual possibility of
saving or destroying us. But we feel free, we understand our oppor­
tunities and our dangers only by fits and starts. And it is the
intermittence of these fits and starts, their rarity, which explains

Directions for Decomposition
why this world is no more than a mediocre slaughterhouse and a
fictive paradise . To argue about freedom leads to no consequence
in good or evil; but we have only moments to realize that everything
depends on us . . . Freedom is an

ethical

principle of

demonic

essence.

Overworked by Dreams
If we could conserve the energy we lavish in that series of dreams
we nightly leave behind us, the mind's depth and subtlety would
reach unimaginable proportions. The scaffolding of a nightmare
requires a nervous expenditure more exhausting than the best
articulated theoretical construction. How, after waking, begin
again the task of aligning ideas when, in our unconscious, we were
mixed up with grotesque and marvelous spectacles, we were sail­
ing among the spheres without the shackles of anti-poetic
Causality? For hours we were like drunken gods - and suddenly,
our open eyes erasing night's infinity, we must resume, in day's
mediocrity, the enterprise of insipid problems, without any of the
night's hallucinations to help us. The glorious and deadly fantasy
was all for nothing then; sleep has exhausted us in vain. Waking,
another kind of weariness awaits us; after having had j ust time
enough to forget the night's, we are at grips with the dawn's. We
have labored hours and hours in horizontal immobility without
our brain's deriving the least advantage of its absurd activity. An
imbecile who was not victimized by this waste, who might accu­
mulate all his resources without dissipating them in dreams, would
be able - owner of an ideal state of waking - to disentangle all the
snags of the metaphysical lies or initiate himself into the most
inextricable difficulties of mathematics.
After each night we are emptier: our mysteries and our griefs have
leaked away into our dreams. Thus sleep's labor not only diminishes
the power of our thought, but even that of our secrets . . .

57

A Short History of Decay

The Model Traitor
Since life can be fulfilled only within individuation - that last bastion
of solitude - each being is necessary alone by the fact that he is an
individual. Yet all individuals are not alone in the same way nor with
the same intensity: each occupies a different rank in the hierarchy
of solitude; at one extreme stands the traitor : he is an individual to
the point of exasperation. In this sense, Judas is the loneliest being
in the history of Christianity, but not in the history of solitude. He
betrayed only a god; he

knew what he betrayed; he betrayed someone,

as so many others betray something: a country or other more or less
collective pretexts. The betrayal which focuses on a specific obj ect,
even if it involves dishonor or death, is not at all mysterious : we
always have the image of what we want to destroy; guilt is clear,
whether admitted or denied. The others cast you out, and you resign
yourself to the cell or the guillotine .

.

.

But there exists a much more complex modality of betrayal,
without immediate reference, without relation to an obj ect or a
person. Thus: to abandon

everything

without knowing what this

ev�rything represents ; 1"0 iS01ate Y0urself fro0!!! your mi!ie'!! ; to reject
-

by a metaphysical divorce - the substance which has molded you,

which surrounds you, and which carries you .
Who, and b y what defiance , can challenge existence with impun­
ity? Who, and by what efforts, can achieve a liquidation of the very
principle of his own breath? Yet the will to undermine the founda­
tions of all that exists produces a craving for negative effectiveness,
powerful and ineffable as a whiff of remorse corrupting the young
vitality of a hope . . .
When you have betrayed

being you

bear with you only a vague

discomfort; there is no image sustaining the object which provokes
the sensation of infamy. No one casts the first stone; you are a
respectable citizen as before; you enj oy the honors of the city, the
consideration of your kind; the laws protect you; you are as estimable

58

Directions for Decomposition

as anyone else - and yet no one sees that you are living your funeral
in advance and that your death can add nothing to your irremediably
established condition. 1bis is because the traitor to existence is account­
able only to himself. Who else can ask him for an accounting? If you
denounce neither a man nor an institution, you run no risk; no law
protects Reality, but all of them punish you for the merest prejudice
against its appearances. You are entitled to sap Being itself, but no
human being; you may legally demolish the foundations of all that is,
but prison or death awaits your least infringement of individual powers.
Nothing protects Existence: there is no case against metaphysical trai­
tors, against the Buddhas who reject salvation, for we judge them
traitors only to their own lives. Yet of all malefactors, these are the
most harmful: they do not attack the fruit, but the very sap of the
universe. Their punishment? They alone know what it is . . .
It may be that in every traitor there is a thirst for opprobrium,
and that his choice of betrayal depends on the degree of solitude
he aspires to. Who has not experienced the desire to perpetrate an
incomparable crime which would exclude him from the human
race? Who has not coveted ignominy in order to sever for good the
links which attach him to others, to suffer a condemnation without
appeal and thereby to reach the peace of the abyss? And when we
break with the universe, is it not for the calm of an unpardonable
crime? A Judas with the soul of a Buddha - what a model for a
coming and concluding humanity!

In One of the Earth's Attics

'I have dreamed of distant springs, of a sun shining on nothing but
seafoam and the oblivion of my birth, of a sun opposed to the earth
and to this disease of finding nothing anywhere but the desire to be
somewhere else. The earthly fate - who has inflicted it upon us,
who has chained us to this morose matter, a petrified tear against
which - born of time - our tears shatter, whereas it has fallen,
immemorial, from God's first shudder?

59

A

Short History of Decay

'I have loathed the planet's noons and midnights, I have longed

for a world without weather, without hours and the fear that swells
them, I have hated the sighs of mortals under the weight of ages.
Where is the moment without end and without desire, and that
primal vacancy insensitive to the presentiments of disaster and of
life? I have sought for the geography of Nothingness, of unknown
seas and another sun - pure of the scandal of life-bearing rays

-

I

have sought for the rocking of a skeptical ocean in which islands
and axioms are drowned, the vast liquid narcotic, tepid and sweet
and tired of knowledge . . .
'This earth - sin of the Creator! But I no longer want to expiate
others' sins. I want to be cured of my begetting in an agony outside
the continents, in some fluid desert , in an impersonal shipwreck.'

Indefinite Horror
It is not the outbreak of a speCific evil which reminds us of our

fragility: there are vaguer but more troublesome warnings to signifY
our imminent excommunication from the temporal. The approach
of disgust, of that sensation which physiologically separates us from
the world, shows hour clp�trl l("tihlp is the solidity of our instincts or
the consistency of our attachments. In health, our flesh echoes the
universal pulsation and our blood reproduces its cadence; in disgust,
which lies in wait for us like a potential hell in order to suddenly
seize upon us afterwards, we are as isolated in the whole as a monster
imagined by some teratology of solitude.
The critical point of our vitality is not disease - which is struggle
- but that indefinite horror which rejects everything and strips our
desires of the power to procreate new mistakes. The senses lose
their sap, the veins dry up, and the organs no longer perceive
anything but the inter val separating them from their own functions.
Everything turns insipid: provender and dreams. No more aroma
in matter and no more enigma in meditation; gastronomy and
metaphysics both become victims of our want of appetite. We spend

60

Directions for Decomposition
hours waiting for other hours, waiting for the moments which no
longer flee time , the faithful moments which reinstate us in the
mediocrity of health . . . and the amnesia of its dangers.
(Greed for space, unconscious covetousness of the future , health
shows us how supe1ficial the level of life is as such, and how incom­
patible organic equilibrium is with inner depth.
The mind, in its range, proceeds from our compromised func­
tions: it takes wing insofar as the void dilates within our organs. We
are healthy only insofar as we are not specifically ourselves: it is our
disgusts which individualize us; our melancholies which grant us a
name; our losses which make us possessors of our . . . self. We are
ourselves only by the sum of our failures.)

Unconscious Dogm as
We are in a position to penetrate someone's mistake, to show him the
inanity of his plans and intentions; but how wrest him from his persist­
ence in time, when he conceals a fanaticism as inveterate as his
instincts, as old as his prejudices? We bear within us - like an unchal­
lengeable treasure - an amalgam of unworthy beliefs and certitudes.
And even the man who manages to rid himself of them, to vanquish
them, remains - in the desert of his lucidity - a fanatic still : a fanatic
of himself, of his own existence; he has scoured all his obsessions,
except for the terrain where they flourish; he has lost all his fixed
points, except for the fixity from which they proceed. Life has dogmas
more immutable than theology; each existence being anchored in
infallibilities which exceed all the lucubrations of madness or of faith.
Even the skeptic, in love with his doubts, turns out to be a fanatic of
skepticism. Man is the dogmatic beingpar excellence; and his dogmas
are all the deeper when he does not formulate them, when he is
unaware of them, and when he follows them.
We all believe in many more things than we think, we harbor
intolerances, we cherish bloody prejudices, and, defending our ideas

61

A Short History of Decay

with extreme means, we travel the world like ambulatory and irre­
fragable fortresses. Each of us is a supreme dogma to himself; no
theology protects its god as we protect our self; and if we assail this
self with doubts and call it into question, we do so only by a pseudo­
elegance of our pride: the case is already won.
How escape the absolute of oneself? One would have to imagine
a being without instincts, without a name, and to whom his own image
would be unknown. But everything in the world gives us back our
own features; night itself is never dark enough to keep us from being
reflected in it. Too present to ourselves, our non-existence before birth
and after death influences us only as a notion and only for a few
moments; we experience the fever of our duration as an eternity which
falters but which nonetheless remains unexhaustible in its principle.
The man who does not adore himself is yet to be born. Everything
that lives loves itself; if not, what would be the source of the dread
which breaks out in the depths and on the surfaces of life? Each of
us is, for himself, the one fixed point in the universe. And if someone
dies for an idea, it is because it is his idea, and his idea is his life.
No critique of any kind of reason will waken man from his
'dogmatic sleep.' It may shake the unconscious certitudes which
abound in his philosophy and substitute more flexible propositions
for his rigid affirmations, hu t how hy ::l r::ltion::ll prnC"Pcll lrp , wil l it
manage to shake the creature, huddled over its own dogmas, with­
out bringing about its very death?

Duality

There is a vulgarity which makes us admit anything in this world,
but which is not powerful enough to make us admit this world itself.
Hence we can endure life's miseries even as we repudiate Life, let
ourselves be swept away by the frenzies of desire even as we reject
Desire. In the assent to existence there is a kind of baseness, which
we escape by means of our prides and our regrets, but particularly
by means of the melancholy which keeps us from sliding into a final

62

Directions for Decomposition
affirmation, wrested from our cowardice. Is anything viler than to
say yes to the world? And yet we keep multiplying that consent, that
trivial repetition, that loyalty oath to life, denied only by everything
in -us that rej ects vulgarity.
We can live the way the others do and yet coriceal a

'no' greater

than the world: that is melancholy's infinity . . .
(We can love only the beings who do not exceed the minimum of
vulgarity indispensable for life itself Yet it would be difficult to delimit
the quantity of such vulgarity, especially since no action can do with­
out it. All of life's rejects prove that they were insufficiently sordid . . .
The man who prevails in the conflict with his neighbors stands on
top of a dungheap; and the man who is vanquished there pays for a
purity he has been unwilling to sully. In every man, nothing is more
alive and true than his own vulgarity. source of all that is vital in
elemental terms. But, on the other hand, the more deeply rooted you
are in life, the more contemptible you are. The man who does not
spread a vague funereal radiation around himself, and who in passing
fails to leave a whiff of melancholy from remote worlds - that man
belongs to sub-zoology; more specifically to human history.
The opposition between vulgarity and melancholy is so irreducible
that next to it all other oppositions seem to be inventions of the mind,
arbitrary and entertaining; even the most decisive antimonies blur
beside this opposition in which are brought face to face - according
to a predestined dosage - our lower depths and our dreaming gall.)

The Renegade
He remembers being born somewhere, having believed in native
errors, having proposed principles and preached inflammatory stupid­
ities. He blushes for it . . . and strives to abjure his past, his real or
imaginary fatherlands, the truths generated in his very marrow. He
will find peace only after having annihilated in himself the last reflex
of the citizen, the last inherited enthusiasm. How could the heart's

A Short History of Decay
habits still chain him when he seeks liberation from genealogies and
,

when even the ideal of the ancient sage, scorner of all cities, seems
to him a compromise? The man who can no longer take sides because

all men are necessarily right and wrong, because everything is at once
justified and irrational - that man must renounce his own name, tread
his identity underfoot, and begin a new life in impassibility or despair.
Or otherwise, invent another genre of solitude, expatriate himself in

the void, and pursue - by means of one exile or another - the stages
of uprootedness. Released from all prejudices, he becomes the un­
usable man par excellence, to whom no one turns and whom no one
fears because he admits and repudiates everything with the same
detachment. Less dangerous than a heedless insect, he is nonetheless
a scourge for Life, for it has vanished from his vocabulary, with the
seven days of the Creation. And Life would forgive him if at least he
,

relished Chaos, which is where Life began. But he denies the feverish
origins, beginning with his own, and preserves, with regard to the
world, only a cold memory, a polite regret.
(From denial to denial, his existence is diminished: vaguer and
more unreal than a syllogism of sighs, how could he still be a crea­
ture of flesh and blood? Anemic, he rivals the Idea itself; he has
abstracted himselffrom his ancestors, from his friends, from every
soul and himself; in hi s w'ins, on("e turhu l ent, rests

Shades of the Future
We are justified in imagining a time when we shall have transcended
everything, even music, even poetry, a time when, detractors of our
traditions and our transports, we shall achieve such a disavowal of
ourselves that, weary of a known grave, we shall make our way

Directionsfor Decomposition
through the days in a threadbare shroud. When a sonnet, whose
rigor raises the verbal world above a splendidly imagined cosmos
- when a sonnet ceases to be a temptation for our tears, and when
in the middle of a sonata our yawns win out over our emotion, then
the graveyards will have nothing more to do with us, for they receive
only fresh corpses, still imbued with a suspicion of warmth and a
memory of life.
Before our old age a time will come when, retracing our ardors,
and bent beneath the recantations of the flesh, we shall walk, half­
carrion, half-specter . . . We shall have repressed - out of fear of
complicity with illusion - any palpitation within us. Unable to have
disembodied our life in a sonnet, we shall drag our corruption in
shreds and tatters, and for having outstripped music and death alike,
we shall stumble, blind, toward a funereal immortality . . .

The Flower of Fixed Ideas
So long as man is protected by madness, he functions and flourishes;
but when he frees himself from the fruitful tyranny of fixed ideas,
he is lost, ruined. He beginS to accept everything, to wrap not only
minor abuses in his tolerance, but crimes and monstrosities, vices
and aberrations: everything is worth the same to him. His indulgence,
self-destroying as it is, extends to all the guilty, to the victims and the
executioners; he takes all sides, because he espouses all opinions;
gelatinOUS, contaminated by infinity, he has lost his <character,' lack­
ing any point of reference, any obsession. The universal view melts
things into a blur, and the man who still makes them out, being
neither their friend nor their enemy; bears in himself

a

wax heart

which indiscriminately takes the form of objects and beings. His pity
is addressed to . . . existence, and his charity is that of doubt and not
that of love; a skeptical charity, consequence of knowledge, which
excuses all anomalies. But the man who takes sides, who lives in the
folly of decision and choice, is never charitable; incapable of compre­
hending all points of view; confined in the horizon of his desires and

65

his principles, he plunges into a

hypnosis of the finite.

This is because

creatures flourish only by turning their backs on the universal . . .
To be something - unconditional - is always a form of madness from
which life - flower of fixed ideas - frees itself only to fade.

The 'Celestial Dog'
Unknowable, what a man must lose to have the courage to confront
the conventions - unknowable what Diogenes lost to become the man
who permitted himself everything, who translated his innermost
thoughts into actions with a supernatural insolence, like some libid­
inous yet pure god of knowledge. No one was so frank; a limit case of
sincerity and lucidity as well as an example of what we could be if
education and hypocrisy did not rein in our desires and our gestures.
'One day a man invited him into a richly furnished house, saying
"be careful not to spit on the floor. " Diogenes, who needed to spit,

spat in his face, exclaiming that it was the only dirty place he could
find where spitting was permitted. ' - Diogenes Laertius.
Who, after being received by a rich man, has not longed oceans
of saliva to expectorate on all the owners of the earth? And who
ha.� not swal l owecl his own spittl e for fea r of ra "tin g it in th e

some stout and respected thief?
We are all absurdly prudent and timid: cynicism is not something
we are taught in school. Nor is pride .

'Menippus, in his work entitled

The Virtue of Diogenes,

tells how

he was captured and sold as a slave, and that he was asked what he
knew how to do. Diogenes answered: "Command!" and shouted to
the herald: 'i\sk who wants to buy a master.'"
The man who affronted Alexander and Plato, who masturbated
in the marketplace (If only heaven let us rub our bellies too, and
that be enough to stave off hunger! ' ) , the man o f the famous cask
and the famous lantern, and who in his youth was a counterfeiter
(what higher dignity for a cyniC?) , what must his experience have
been of his neighbors? Certainly our own, yet with this differ ence :

66

Directionsfor Decomposition

that man was the sole substance of his reflection and his contempt.
Without suffering the falsifications of any ethic and any metaphysic,
he strove to strip man in order to show him to us nakeder and more
abominable than any comedy, any apocalypse has done.
'Socrates gone mad: Plato called him - Socrates turned sincere is
what he should have said, Socrates renouncing the Good, abjuring
formulas and the City, Socrates turning, finally, into a psychologist
and nothing more. But Socrates - even sublime - remains conven­
tional; he remains a master, an edifYing model. Only Diogenes proposes
nothing; the basis of his attitude - and of cynicism in its essence - is
determined by a testicular horror of the absurdity of being man.
The thinker who reflects without illusion upon human reality, if
he wants to remain within the world, and if he eliminates mysticism
as an escape-hatch, ends up with a vision in which are mingled wisdom,
bitterness, and farce; and if he chooses the marketplace as the site of
his solitude, he musters his verve in mocking his 'kind' or in exhibiting
his disgust, a disgust which today, with Christianity and the police, we
can no longer permit ourselves. Two thousand years of oaths and
codes have sweetened our bile; moreover, in a hurried world, who
would stop to answer our insolences, to delight in our howls?
That the greatest connoisseur of human beings should have been
nicknamed 'dog' proves that man has never had the courage to
accept his authentic image and that he has always rejected truths
without accommodations. Diogenes suppressed pose in himself
What a monster in other men's eyes! To have an honorable place in
philosophy you must be an actor, you must respect the play of ideas
and exercise yourself over false problems. In no case must man as
such be your business. Again, according to Diogenes Laertius: 'At the
OlympiC games, when the herald proclaimed: "Dioxippus has
vanquished men!" Diogenes answered: "He has vanquished only
slaves - men are my business.'" And indeed he vanquished men as
no one else has ever done; with weapons more dreadful than those
of conquerors, though he owned only a broom, the least proprietary
of all beggars, true saint of mockery.
By a lucky accident, he was born before the Cross made its

A Short History of Decay
appearance. Who knows if, grafted on his detachment, some unhealthy
temptation of extra-human risk might not have induced him to become
an

ordinary ascetic, later canonized, lost in the mass of the blessed and

the maze of the calendar? Then he would have gone mad, he too, the
most profoundly normal of men, since he was remote from all teach­
ing and all doctrine. The hideous countenance of man - Diogenes was
the only one to reveal that to us. The merits of cynicism have been
dimmed and downtrodden by a religion opposed to the evident. But
the moment has come to confront the truths of the Son of God with
those of this 'celestial dog,' as a poet of his time called him.

Ambiguity of Genius
All inspiration proceeds from a faculty of exaggeration : lyricism and the whole world of metaphor - would be a pitiable excitation
without that rapture which dilates words until they burst. When
the elements or the dimensions of the cosmos seem too diminished
to serve as terms of comparison for our conditions, poetry needs
- in order to transcend its stage of virtuality and imminence - only
a

litde clarity in the flashes which prefigure and beget it. No true

inspiration fails to rise nu t of th p ;:mntn;:t ly nf ;:t snu 1 V::lstpr th an the.
world . . . In the verbal conflagration of a Shakespeare and a Shelley
we smell the ash of words, b ackwash and effluvium of an impos­
sible cosmogony. The terms encroach upon each other,

as

though

none could attain the equivalent of the inner dilation; this is the
hernia of the image, the transcendent rupture of poor words, born
of everyday use and miraculously raised to the heart's altitudes. The
truths of beauty are fed on exaggerations which, upon the merest
analysis, turn out to be monstrous and meaningless. Poetry: demi­
urgical divagation of the vocabulary . . . Has charlatanism ever been
more effectively combined with ecstasy? Lying, the wellspring of
all tears! Such is the imposture of genius and the secret of art. Trifles
swollen to the heavens ; the improbable generator of a universe! In
every genius coexist a braggart and a god.

Idolatry of Disaster
All that we build beyond raw existence, all the many powers which
give the world a physiognomy; we owe to Misfortune - architect of
diverSity; intelligible instrument of our actions. What its sphere fails
to engross transcends us: what meaning could an event have which
fails to be overwhelming? The Future

awaits us in order to immolate

us: the mind records nothing but the fracture of existence now, and
the senses still vibrate only in the expectation of disaster . . . How avoid
considering the fate of Chateaubriand's sister Lucile, or of Karoline
von Giinderode and murmuring with the former: 'I shall fall into the
sleep of death upon my destiny;' or gulping the latter's despair which
plunged a dagger into her heart? Apart from a few examples of exhaus­
tive melancholy; and a few unequaled suicides, men are merely puppets
stuffed with red globules in order to beget history and its grimaces.
When , idolaters of disaster, we make it the agent and the
substance of Becoming, we bathe in the limpidity of the prescribed
fate, in a dawn of catastrophes, in a fruitful Gehenna . . . But when,
imagining we have exhausted it, we fear we shall outlive it, existence
darkens and no longer

becomes.

And we dread readapting ourselves

to Hope . . . betraying our disaster, betraying ourselves . . .

The Demon
He is there, in the blood's inferno, in the bitterness of each cell, in
the shudder of our nerves, in those contrary prayers exhaled by
hate, everywhere where he makes, out of horror, his comfort.
Should 1 let him undermine my hours, when as a meticulous accom­
plice of my destruction 1 could vomit up my hopes and desist from
myself? He shares - murderous tenant - my bed, my oblivions, and
my insomnias; to lose him, my own loss is necessary. And when you
have only a body and a soul, the one too heavy and the other too

A ShoTt History of Decay
dim, how bear as well an additional weight, a further darkness? How
drag your way through a dark time? I dream of a golden moment
outside of Becoming, a sunlit moment transcending the torment
of the organs and the melody of their decomposition.
To hear the sobs - agonized, j oyous - of that Evil One who wrig­
gles through your thoughts, and not to strangle the intruder? But
if you attack him, it will only be out of some futile self-indulgence.
He is already your pseudonym; you cannot do him violence without
impunity. Why evade the approach of the last act? Why not attack
yourself in your own name?

(It would be quite false to suppose that the demoniac 'revelation' is a
presence inseparable from our duration; yet when we are gripped by
it, we cannot imagine the quantity of neutral moments we have lived
through before. To invoke the

devil is to tinge with a vestige of theology

an ambiguous excitation which our pride refuses to accept as such.
But who does not know these fears, in which we find ourselves face
to face with the Prince of Darkness? Our pride needs a name, a great
name in order to baptize an anguish which would be pitiable if it
emanated only from physiology. The traditional explanation seems
more flattering to us; a residue of metaphysics suits the mind . . .
It is in this way that - in order to veil our too i m m e di a t e ills

-

we

resort to elegant, although obsolete, entities. How admit that our
most mysterious deliriums proceed from no more than nervous
diseases, whereas it is enough for us to think of the Demon in us or
outside us in order to stand up straight again at once? We inherit
from our ancestors that propensity to obj ectivize our inmost evils;
mythology has impregnated our blood and literature has sustained
in us a relish for

effects . . . )

Nailed t o ourselves, we l a c k the capacity of leaving the path

Directions for Decomposition
life because it is not our element? No one hands out diplomas of
non-existence. We must persevere in breathing, feel the air burn our
lips, accumulate regrets at the heart of a reality which we have not
hoped for, and renounce giving an explanation for the Disease which
brings about our downfall. When each moment of time rushes upon
us like a dagger, when our flesh, instigated by our desires, refuses
to be petrified - how confront a single moment added to our fate?
With the help of what artifices might we find the strength of illusion
to go in search of another life - a new life?
It is because all men who cast a glance over their past ruins imag­
ine - in order to avoid the ruins to come - that it is in their power to
recommence something radically new. They make themselves a
solemn promise, waiting for a miracle which would extricate them
from this average abyss into which fate has plunged them. But noth­
ing happens. They all continue to be the same, modified only by the
accentuation of this tendency to decline which is their characteristic.
We see around us only dilapidated inspirations and ardors: every man

promises everything, but every man lives to know the fragility of his
spark and Life's lack of genius in his life. The authenticity of an exist­
ence consists in its own ruin. The crown of our Becoming: a path that
looks glorious and which leads to a rout; the garland of our gifts:
camouflage of our gangrene . . . Under the sun triumphs a carrion
spring; beauty itself is merely death preening among the buds . . .
I have known no 'new' life which was not illusory and comprom­
ised at its roots. I have seen each man advance into time to be isolated
in an anguished rumination and to fall back into himself with, as the
sign of renewal, the unforeseen grimace of his own hopes.

Triple Impasse
The mind discovers Identity; the soul, Ennui; the body, Sloth. It is
one and the same principle of invariability, differently expressed
under the three forms of the universal yawn.
The monotony of existence justifies the rationalists' thesis;

A

it shows us a legal universe in which everything is anticipated
and adjusted; the barbarism of no surprise comes to trouble its
harmony.
If the same mind discovers C ontradiction, the sa m e soul,
Delirium, the same body Frenzy, it is in order to beget new unrea­
lities, to escape a universe too demonstrably the same ; and it is
the anti-rationalists' thesis which p revails . The flowering of
absurdities reveals an existence before which all clarity of vision
seems mockingly poor. This is the perpetual aggression of the
Unforeseeable .
Between these two tendencies, man wields his ambiguity: finding
his place in neither life nor Idea, he supposes himself predestined to
the Arbitrary; yet his intoxication of freedom is only a shudder
within a fatality, the form of his fate being no less regulated than
that of a sonnet or a star.

Cosmogony of Desire
Having lived out - having

verified all the arguments against life - I

have stripped it of its savors, and wallowing in its lees, I have expe­
ri en ce d its n akedness J h ave kn own post-sexn a l m etaphysi cs, th e

void of the futilely procreated universe, and that dissipation of
sweat which plunges you into an age-old chill, anterior to the rages
of matter. And I have tried to be faithful to my knowledge , to force
my instincts to yield, and realized that it is no use wielding the
weapons of nothingness if you cannot turn them against yourself.
For the outburst of desires, amid our knowledge which contradicts
them, creates a dreadful conflict between our mind opposing the
Creation and the irrational substratum which binds us to it still.
Each desire humiliates the sum of our truths and forces us to
reconsider our negations. We endure a practical defeat; yet our prin­
ciples remain unshakable . . . We hoped to be no longer children of
this world, and here we are subj ect to the appetites like equivocal
ascetics, masters of time and grafted to our glands. But this interplay

72

Directions for Decomposition
is limidess: each of our desires recreates the world and each of our
thoughts annihilates it . . . In everyday life, cosmogony alternates with
apocalypse: quotidian creators and wreckers, we enact on an infini­
tesimal scale the eternal myths, and each of our moments reproduces
and prefigures the fate of seed and cinder pertaining to Infinity.

Interpretation of Actions
No one would perform the merest action without the feeling that
this action is the one and only reality. Such blindness is the absolute
basis, the indisputable principle, of all that exists. The man who

argues merely proves

that he

is less, that doubt has sapped his vital­
importance of his
progress toward negation. To know that nothing is worth the trouble
becomes implicidy a belief, hence a possibility of action; this is
ity . . . But amid his very doubts, he must feel the

because even a trifle of existence presupposes an unavowed faith; a
simple step - even toward a mock-up of reality - is an apostasy with
regard to nothingness; breathing itself proceeds from an impliCit
fanaticism, like any participation in movement . . .

Life without Obj ective
Neutral ideas like dry eye s ; dull looks which strip things of all
dimension; self-auscultations which reduce the feelings to phenom­
ena of attention; a vaporous life , without tears and without
laughter - how to inculcate a sap, a vernal vulgarity? And how to
endure this resigning heart, this time too blunted to transmit even
to its own seasons the ferment of growth and dissolution?
When you have seen a corruption in every conviction and in
every attachment a profanation, you no longer have the right to
expect, on earth or elsewhere, a fate modified by hope. You must
choose some ideal, absurdly solitary promontory, or a farcical star
refractory to all constellations. Irresponsible out of melancholy,

Acedia
This stagnation of the organs, this stupor of the faculties, this petri­
fied smile - do they not often remind you of the ennui of the
cloisters, hearts abandoned by God, the dryness and idiocy of the
monks loathing themselves in the ecstatic transports of masturba­
tion? You are merely a monk without divine hypotheses and without
the pride of solitary vice.
Earth, heaven are the walls of your cell, and in the air no breath
disturbs, only the absence of orisons prevails. Doomed to the empty
hours of eternity, to the periphery of shudders and the mildewed
desires that rot at the approach of salvation, you bestir yourself
toward a LastJudgment without splendor and trumpets, while your
thoughts, for solemnity, have imagined no more than the unreal
procession of hopes.

the antipodes, sees only invulnerability everywhere. Both have
attained the extremity of a self-infatuated consciousness: every­
thing conspires against the one; to the other, everything is favorable.
(The brave man is only a braggart who embraces the danger, who
flees toward the danger.) One establishes himself negatively at the
center of the world, the other positively; but their illusion is the
same, their knowledge having an identical point of departure:
danger as the only reality. One fears it, the other seeks it out: they
cannot conceive a lucid scorn of things, they both relate everything
to themselves, they are over-agitated (and all the evil in the world
comes from the excess of agitation, from the dynamic fictions of
bravery and cowardice). Thus these antinomic and equal examples
are the agents of all our troubles, the disturbers of the march of
time; they give an affective tinge to the least event and project
their fevered intentions upon a universe which - without an aban­
donment to calm disgusts - is degrading and intolerable. Courage
and fear, two poles of the same disease, which consists in granting
an abusive sense and seriousness to life . . . It is the lack of noncha­
lant bitterness which makes men into sectarian beasts; the subtlest
and the crudest crimes are perpetrated by those who take things
seriously. Only the dilettante has no taste for blood, he alone is no
scoundrel . . .

Disintoxication

The non-mysterious concerns of human beings may be drawn as
clearly as the outlines of this page . . . What is to be inscribed here
but the disgust of generations linked like propositions in the sterile

The human adventure will certainly come to an end, which we
may conceive without being its contemporary. When we have

his hoaxes. Thousands of years of sufferings, which would have
softened the hearts of stones, merely petrified this steely mayfly,
monstrous example of evanescence and hardening, driven by one
insipid madness, a will to exist at once imperceptible and shameless.
When we realize that no human motive is compatible with infinity
and that no gesture is worth the trouble of making it, our heart,
by its very beating, can no longer conceal its vacuity. Men mingle
in a uniform fate as futile, for the indifferent eye, as the stars - or
the crosses of a military cemetery. Of all the goals proposed for
existence, which one, subjected to analysis, escapes the music-hall
or the morgue? Which fails to reveal us as futile or sinister? And is
there a single stroke of magic, is there one charm which can still
deceive us?
(When we are forbidden visible prescriptions, we become, like the
devil, metaphysically illegal; we have left the order of the world: no
longer finding a place there, we look at it without recognition;
stupefaction turns into a reflex, while our plaintive astonishment,
lacking an object, is forever fastened to the Void. We undergo sensa­
tions which no longer correspond to things because nothing irritates
them any longer; thus we transcend even the dream of the angel of
Melancholia. and we regret that Durer did nor languish for eyes
even more remote . . .
When everything seems too concrete, too existent, including our
noblest vision, and we sigh for an Indefinite which would proceed
from neither life nor death, when every contact with Being is a
violation of the soul, the soul has been excluded from the universal
jurisdiction and, no longer having any accounting to make or laws
to infringe, vies - by melancholy - with the divine omnipotence.)

Itinerary of Hate
I hate no

one; but hatred blackens my blood and scorches this skin
which the years were powerless to tan. How prevail, under tender

Directions for Decomposition
or rigorous judgments, over a hideous gloom and the scream of a
man flayed alive?
I wanted to love heaven and e arth, their exploits and their fevers
- and I have found nothing which failed to remind me of death:
flowers, stars, faces - symbols of withering, potential slabs of all
possible tombs! What is created in life, and ennobles it, tends toward
a macabre or mediocre end. The effervescence of hearts has
provoked disasters which n o demon would have dared conceive.
Look upon a mind enflamed and be sure that you will end by being
its victim. Those who believe in

their truth - the only ones whose

imprint is retained by the memory of men - leave the earth behind
them strewn with corpses. Religions number in their ledgers more
murders than the bloodiest tyrannies account for, and those whom
humanity has called divine far surpass the most conscientious
murderers in their thirst for slaughter.
The man who proposes a new faith is persecuted, until it is his
turn to become a persecutor : truths begin by a conflict with the
police and end by calling them in; for each absurdity we have suffered
for degenerates into a legality, as every martyrdom ends in the
paragraphs of the Law, in the insipidities of the calendar, or the
nomenclature of the streets. In this world, heaven itself becomes

authOrity;

and we know ages which lived only by it - Middle Ages

more prodigal in wars than the most dissolute epochs, bestial
crusades tricked out as sublimities, before which the invasions of
the Huns seem the refrains of decadent hordes.
Immaculate exploits decline into public enterprise; consecra­
tion dims the most aerial halo. An angel protected by a policeman
- that is how truths die , that is how enthusiasms expire . It is
enough that a rebellion be right and create adherents, a revelation
be propagated and an institution confiscate it, for the once-solitary
transports - divided among a few neophyte dreamers - to be
corrupted in a prostituted existence. Show me one thing here on
earth which has begun well and which has not ended badly. The

downfall constitutes the heart's drama and the negative meaning
of history. Each <ideal' fed , at its beginning, on the bloo d of its
votaries, erodes and collapses when it is adopted by the mob. The
font transformed into a spittoon: that is the ineluctable rhythm
of <progress' . . .
Under these conditions, upon whom are we to pour out our
hatred? No one is responsible for being and still less for being what
he is. Afflicted with existence, each man endures like an animal the
consequences which proceed from it. Thus, in a world where every­
thing is detestable, hatred becomes huger than the world and, having
transcended its object, cancels itself out.
(It is nor our suspect exhaustions or the specific disturbances of
our organs which reveal the low point of our vitality; nor is it our
perplexities or the variations of the thermometer; but we need
merely endure those fits of hatred and pity

without motive,

those

non-measurable fevers, to understand that our equilibrium is threat­
ened. To hate everything and to hate yourself, in a frenzy of
cannibal rage; to pity everyone and to pity yourself - apparently
contradictory impulses, but at their source identical; for we can
pity only what we want to do away with, what does not deserve to
exist. And in these convulsions. the

this vague and universal compassion turns toward yourself, you
are in the condition of the last and least of men. It is from an enor­
mous physical weakness that this negative solidarity emanates, a
solidarity which, in hate or pity, binds us to things. These two
frenzies, simultaneous or consecutive , are not so much uncertain
symptoms as clear signs of a falling vitality irritated by anything
and everything - from undelineated existence to the precision of
our own person.

What a preposterous notion, to draw circles in hell, to make the
intensity of the flames vary in its compartments, to hierarchize
its torments! The important thing is to be there; the rest - mere
fiorituras or . . . burns. In the heavenly city - gender prefiguration
of the one below, both being under the same management - the
essential thing, too, is not to be something - king, bourgeois, day­
laborer - but to adhere to it or to escape it. You can champion
some idea or other, have a place or crawl - from the moment your
actions and your thoughts serve a form of real or imagined city
you are its idolators and its captives. The timidest employee and
the wildest anarchist, if they take a different interest here, live as
its function: they are both citizens internally, though the one
prefers his slippers and the other his bomb. The 'circles' of the
earthly city, like those of the one underground, imprison beings
in a damned community, and dog them in the same procession of
sufferings, in which to look for nuances would be a waste of
time. The man who acquiesces in human affairs - in any form,
revolutionary or conservative - consumes himself in a pitiable
delectation: he commingles his nobilities and his vulgarities in the
confusion of Becoming . . .
To the dissenter, within or outside the city, reluctant to intervene
in the course of great events or small, all modalities of life in
common seem equally contemptible. History can offer him only
the pale interest of renewed disappointments and anticipated arti­
fices. The man who has lived among men and still lies in wait for a
Single unexpected event such a man has understood nothing and

every office and every honor. So it is with all men - which explains
the longevity of this sublunary hell.

History and Language

Who can resist the autumnal wisdom of the flaccid and faisande
civilizations? The Greek's horror, like the belated Roman's, of
freshness and the hyperborean reflexes, emanated from a repulsion
for dawns, for barbarism overflowing with futures, and for the
stupidities of health. The resplendent corruption of every historic
late-season is darkened by the proximity of the Scythian. No civil­
ization can draw out an indefinite agony; tribes prowl about,
scenting the aromas of perfumed corpses . . . Thus, the enthusiast
of sunsets contemplates the failure of all refinement and the inso­
lent advance of vitality. Nothing left for him to do but collect, from
the sum of the future , a few anecdotes . . A system of events no
longer proves anything: the great deeds have joined the fairy tales
and the handbooks . The glorious exploits of the past, like the men
who performed them , are still of interest only for the fine words
which have consecrated them. Woe to the conqueror without a
word to say! Jesus himself, th ollgh ::In i n � i rt>rt dicr<!r01" f01" ,'YO
thousand years, marked the memory of his faithful and of his
detractors only by the tatters of paradoxes which strew a biog­
raphy so adroitly scenic. How inquire about a martyr today if he
has not uttered remarks adequate to his sufferings? We keep the
memory of past or recent victims only if their language has
immortalized the blood which has spattered them. The execution­
ers themselves survive only insofar as they were performers: Nero
would be long since forgotten without his outbursts of bloody
clowning.
When, at the dying man's bedside, his nearest and dearest bend
over his stammerings, it is not so much to decipher in them some
last wish, but rather to gather up a good phrase which they can
quote later on, in order to honor his memory. If the Roman
.

80

Directionsfor Decomposition
historians never fail to describe the agony of their emperors, it is
in order to place within them a sentence or an exclamation which
the latter uttered or were supposed to have uttered. This is true
for all deathbeds, even the most ordinary. That life signifies nothing,
everyone knows or suspects; let it at least be saved by a turn of
phrase! A sentence at the corners of their life - that is about all we
ask of the great - and of the small. If they fail this requirement,
this obligation, they are lost forever; for we forgive everything,
down to crimes, on condition they are exquisitely

glossed

- and

glossed over. This is the absolution man grants history as a whole,
when no other criterion is seen to be operative and valid , and
when he himself, recapitulating the general inanity, finds no other
dignity than that of a

litterateur

of failure and an aesthete of

bloodshed.
In this world, where sufferings are merged and blurred, only the

Formula prevails.

Philosophy and Prostitution
The philosopher, disappointed with systems and superstitions but
still persevering in the ways of the world, should imitate the side­
walk Pyrrhonism exhibited by the least dogmatic of creatures : the
prostitute . Detached from everything and open to everything;
espousing her client's mood and ideas; changing tone and face on
each occasion; ready to be sad or gay, being indifferent; lavishing
sighs out of commercial concern; casting upon the frolic of her
superimposed and sincere neighbor an enlightened and artificial
gaze - she proposes to the mind a model of behavior which vies
with that of the sages. To be without convictions in regard to men
and oneself, such is the high lesson of prostitution, peripatetic
academy of lucidity, marginal to society - as is philosophy. 'Every­
thing I know I learned in the School of Whores! ' should be the
exclamation of the thinker who accepts everything and rej ects
everything when, follOwing their example, he has specialized in the

8I

A Short History of Decay

weary smile, when men are to him merely clients, and the world's
sidewalks the marketplace where he sells his bitterness, as his
companions sell their bodies.

Obsession of the Essential

When every question seems accidental and peripheral, when the
mind seeks ever greater problems, it turns out that in its procedure
it no longer comes up against any object but the diffuse obstacle of
the Void. Thereupon, the philosophic energy, exclusively oriented
toward the inaccessible, is exposed to ruin. Scrutinizing things and
their temporal pretexts, it imposes salutary embarrassments upon
itself; but, if it seeks an increasingly general principle, it is lost and
annihilated in the vagueness of the Essential.
Only those who stop apropos in philosophy flourish, those who
accept the limitation and the comfort of a reasonable stage of anxi­
ety. Every problem, if we get to the bottom of it, leads to bankruptcy
and leaves the intellect exposed: no more questions and no more
answers in a space without horizon. The interrogations turn against
the mind which has conceived them: it becomes their victim. Every­
thing is hostile to it: its own solitude, its mvn audad.!J� the opaque
absolute, the unverifiable gods, and the manifest nothingness. Woe
to the man who, having arrived at a certain moment of the essential,
has not drawn up short! History shows that the thinkers who
mounted to the top of the ladder of questions, who set their foot
on the last rung, that of the absurd, have bequeathed to posterity
only an example of sterility, whereas their confreres, stopping half­
way up, have fertilized the mind's growth; they have served their
kind, they have transmitted some well-turned idol, some polished
superstitions, some errors disguised as principles, and a system of
hopes. Had they embraced the dangers of an excessive progression,
this score of charitable mistakes would have rendered them disas­
trous to others and to themselves; they would have inscribed their
names on the confines of the universe and of thought - unhealthy

82

Directions for Decomposition
seekers and arid reprobates, amateurs of fruitless dizziness, hunters
of dreams it is not permitted to dream . . .
Ideas refractory to the Essential are the only ones to h ave a
purchase on men. What would they do with a region of thought
where even the man who aspires to settle by natural inclination or
morbid thirst is j eopardized? No breathing in a realm alien to the
usual doubts. And if certain minds locate themselves outside the
agreed upon inquiries, it is because an instinct rooted in the depths
of matter, or a vice rising out of a cosmic disease, has taken posses­
sion of them and has led them to an order of reflections so exigent
and so enormous that death itself seems of no importance, the
elements of destiny mere nonsense, and the apparatus of metaphys­
ics no more than utilitarian and suspect. This obsession with a last
frontier, this progress in the void involve the most dangerous form
of sterility, beside which nothingness itself seems a promise of
fecundity. The man who is difficu lt in what he does - in his task or
his adventure - has merely to transplant his demand forfinish to the
universal level in order to be no longer able to complete either his
work or his life.
Metaphysical anguish derives from the condition of a supremely
scrupulous artisan whose obj ect would be nothing less than

being.

By dint of analysis, he achieves the impossibility of composing, or
perfecting, a miniature of the universe. The artist abandoning his
poem, exasperated by the indigence of words, prefigures the confu­
sion of the mind discontented within the context of the existent.
Incapacity to organize the elements - as stripped of meaning and
savor as the words which express them - leads to the revelation of
the void. Thus the rhymer withdraws into silence or into impen­
etrable artifices. In the face of the universe, the over-exigent mind
suffers a defeat like Mallarme's in the face of art. It is panic before
an object which is no longer an obj ect, which can no longer be
manipulated, for - ideally - its limits have been transcended. Those
who do not remain

inside

the reality they cultivate, those who

transcend the task of existing, must either compromise with the
inessential, reverse gears and take their places in the eternal farce,

A Short History of Decay

or accept all the consequences of a severed condition which is
either superfetation or tragedy, depending on whether it is contem­
plated or endured.

Felicity of Epigones

Is there a pleasure more subtly ambiguous than to watch the ruin
of a myth? What dilapidation of hearts in order to beget it, what
excesses of intolerance in order to make it respected, what terror
for those who do not assent to it, and what expense of hopes for
those who watch it . . . expire ! Intelligence flourishes only in the
ages when beliefs wither, when their articles and their precepts
slacken, when their rules collapse . Every period's ending is the
mind's paradise, for the mind regains its play and its whims only
within an organism in utter dissolution. The man who has the
misfortune to belong to a period of creation and fecundity suffers
its limitations and its ruts; slave of a unilateral vision, he is enclosed
within a limited horizon. The most fertile moments in history were
at the same time the most airless; they prevailed like a fatality, a
blessing for the naive mind, mortal to an amateur of intellectual
epigones, among the intellects of belated epochs, epochs whose
style is coming apart and is no longer inspired except by a certain
ironic indulgence.
To belong to a church uncertain of its god - after once imposing
that god by fire and sword - should be the ideal of every detached
mind. When a myth languishes and turns diaphanous, and the
institution which sustains it turns clement and tolerant, problems
acquire a pleasant elasticity. The weak point of a faith, the dimin­
ished degree of its vigor set up a tender void in men's souls and
render them receptive, though without permitting them to be blind,
yet, to the superstitions which lie in wait for the future they darken
already. The mind is soothed only by those agonies of history which
precede the insanity of every dawn . .

Ultimate Audacity
If it is true that Nero exclaimed, 'Lucky Priam, who saw the ruin
of your countryI ' let us grant him the merit of having acceded to a
sublime defiance, to the last hypostasis of the

beau geste and lugubri­

ous grandiloquence. After such a phrase, so marvelously appropriate
in an emperor's mouth, o ne is entitled to banality; one is even
compelled to it. Who could pretend to further extravagance? The
petty accidents of our triviality force us to admire this cruel and
histrionic Caesar (all the more in that his madness has known a glory
greater than the sighs of his victims, written history being at least
as inhuman as the events which provoke it). Beside his, all attitudes
seem antics. And if it is true that he set Rome on fire in imitation
of the fliad, was there ever a more

tangible homage to a work of art?
In any case, it is the one example of literary criticism at work, of an
active aesthetic judgment.
The effect a book has upon us is real only if we crave to imitate
its plot, to kill if its hero kills, to be jealous if he is j ealous, to take
sick and die if he suffers and expires. But all this, for us, remains in
the potential state or declines to dead letters; only Nero grants himself
literature as a spectacle; his accounting is made with the ashes of his
contemporaries and of his capital . . .
Such words and such actions had to be uttered and performed
at least once. A criminal took them upon himself. This can console
us, indeed it must, or else how should we resume our customary
behavior and our convenient and prudent truths?

Effigy of the Failure
Having a horror of any action, he keeps telling himself: 'Movement,
what follyl ' It is not so much events which vex him as the notion of
participating in them; and he bestirs himself only in order to turn

away from them . His sneers have devastated life before he has
exhausted its juice . He is a crossroads Ecclesiast who finds in the
universal meaninglessness an excuse for his defeats. Eager to find
everything unimportant, he succeeds easily, the evidence preponder­
ant on his side . In the battle of arguments, he is always the winner,
as he is always the loser in action: he is 'right: he rejects everything
- and everything rej ects him . He has prematurely compromised
what must not be compromised in order to live - and since his talent
was over-enlightened as to his own functions, he has squandered it
lest it dribble away into the inanity of a work. Bearing the image of
what he might have been as a stigma and a halo, he blushes and
flatters himself on the excellence of his sterility, forever alien to
naive seductions, the one free man among the helots of Time. He
extracts his liberty from the enormity of his lack of accomplish­
ments; he is an infinite and pitiable god whom no creation limits,
no creature worships, and whom no one spares. The scorn he has
poured out on others is returned by them. He expiates only the
actions he has not performed, though their number exceeds the
calculations of his wounded pride. But at the end, as a kind of
consolation, and at the close of a life without honors, he wears his
uselessness like a crown.
(What's the use?' - the Failure's adage, the maxim of death's time­
server . . . What a stimulant when you begin to suffer its obsession!
For death, before weighing too heavily upon us, enriches us, our
powers grow at its contact; then, it performs its work of destruction
upon us. The evidence of the uselessness of all effort, and that
sensation of a future corpse already rising into the present and fill­
ing time's horizon, end by benumbing our ideas, our hopes, and our
muscles, so that the excess of energy provoked by the quite recent
obsession is converted - when that obsession is irrevocably implanted
in the mind - into a stagnation of our vitality. Thus this obsession
incites us to become everything and nothing. Normally it should
confront us with the one choice possible: the convent or the cabaret.
But when we can evade it by neither eternity nor pleasures, when,

86

Directions for Decomposition
attacked in the midst of life we are as far from heaven as from
vulgarity, it transforms us into that kind of decomposed hero who
promises everything and accomplishes nothing: idle men wasting
their breath in the Void; vertical carrion whose sole a ctivity is
reduced to thinking that they will cease to be . . . )

Conditions of Trag edy
If Jesus had ended his career upon the Cross, if he had not been
committed to resuscitation - what a splendid tragic hero! His divine
aspect has cost literature an admirable subj ect. Thereby he shares
the fate, aesthetically mediocre , of all just

men.

Like everything

which perpetuates itself in men's hearts, like everything which is
exposed to worship and does not irremediably die, he does not lend
himself to that vision of a total end which marks out a tragic
destiny. For that it would have been necessary that Jesus have no
followers and that the transfiguration did nor come to raise him to
an illicit halo. Nothing more alien to tragedy than the notion of
redemption, of salvation and immortality! The hero succumbs
under the weight of his own actions, without its being granted him
to evade his death by some supernatural grace; he continues - as

Macbeth collapses without the hope of a redemption: there is no

. . .

The nature of a faith, even if it must fail, is to elude the Irrepar­
able. (What could Shakespeare have done with a martyr?) The true
hero fights and dies in the name of his destiny, and not in the name
of a belief. His existence eliminates any notion of

an

escape; the

paths which do not lead him to death are dead ends to him; he works
at his 'biography' ; he tends to his denouement and instinctively
manages everything to bring about events fatal to himself. Fatality
being his vital juice, every way out can be no more than a disloyalty

A Short History of Decay

to his destruction. Thus the man of destiny is never converted to
any belief whatever: he would thereby spoil his end. And, if he were
immobilized on the cross, it is not he who would raise his eyes to
heaven: his own history is his sole absolute, as his will to tragedy is
his sole desire . . .

The Immanent Lie

To live signifies to believe and to hope - to lie and to lie to oneself.
This is why the most truthful image ever created of man remains
that of the Knight of the Doleful Countenance, that Don whom
we find in even the most fulfilled of the sages. The painful episode
around the Cross and the other more majestic one crowned by
Nirvana participate in the same unreality, though they have been
granted a symbolic quality denied by the sequel of the poor hidalgo's
adventures. Not all men can succeed: the fecundity of their lies varies
. . . One deception triumphs: there results a religion, a doctrine, or
a myth - and a host of adepts; another fails: then it is only a divaga­
tion, a theory, or a fiction. Only inert things add nothing to what
they are: a stone does not lie; it interests no one - whereas life inde­
fatigably invents: life is th e novel of m ;J ttf'T
A dust infatuated with ghosts - such is man: his absolute image,
ideally lifelike, would be incarnated in a Don Quixote seen by
Aeschylus . . .
(If life occupies the first place in the hierarchy of lies, love comes
immediately afterward, lie within the lie. Expression of our hybrid
position, love is surrounded by an apparatus of beatitudes and
torments thanks to which we find in someone a substitute for
ourselves. By what hoax do two eyes turn us away from our solitude?
Is there any failure more humiliating for the mind? Love lulls know­
ledge; wakened, knowledge kills love. Unreality cannot triumph
indefinitely, even disguised in the appearances of the most exalting
lie. And moreover who would have an illusion solid enough to find

88

Directions for Decomposition
in the

other what he has vainly sought in himself? Would a

furnace

of guts afford what the whole universe could not give us? And yet
this is the actual basis of this common, and supernatural, anomaly:
to solve Ii deux - or rather, to suspend - all enigmas; by means of an
imposture, to forget that fiction in which life is steeped; by a double
murmur to fill the general vacuity; and -parody of ecstasy - to drown
oneself at last in the sweat of some accomplice or other . . . )

The Coming of Consciousness
How much our instincts must have had to be blunted and their
functioning slackened before consciousness extended its control
over the sum of our actions and our thoughts ! The first natural
reaction suppressed involved all the postponements of vital activity,
all our failures in the immediate. Man - an animal with retarded
desires - is a lucid nothingness encircling everything and encircled
by nothing, who surveys all obj ects and possesses none.
Compared to the coming of consciousness, other events are of
a minor importance or none at all. But this advent, in contradiction
with the data of life , constitutes a dangerous explosion at the heart
of the animate world, a scandal in biology. Nothing suggested its
imminence: natural automatism suggested no likelihood of an
animal flinging itself beyond matter. The gorilla losing its fur and
replacing it by ideals, the gorilla in gloves, forging gods, aggravating
his grimaces, and adoring the heavens - how much nature was to
suffer, and will suffer still, before such a fall! This is because conscious­
ness leads far and permits everything. For the animal, life is an
absolute; for man, it is an absolute and a pretext. In the evolution
of the universe, there is no phenomenon more important than this
possibility, reserved for us, of converting every object into a pretext,
to play with our everyday undertakings and our last ends, to put on
the same level, by the divinity of whim, a god and a broomstick.
And man will be rid of his ancestors - and of nature - only when
he has liquidated in himself every vestige of the Unconditioned,

The Arrogance of Prayer
When w e reach the limits of monologue, the confines o f solitude,
we invent - for lack of another interlocutor - God, supreme pretext
of dialogue. So long as you name Him, your madness is well
disguised, and . . . all is permitted. The true believer is scarcely
to be distinguished from the madman; but his madness is legal,
acknowledged; he would end up in an asylum if his aberrations
were pure of all faith. But God covers them, legitimizes them. The
pride of a conqueror pales beside the ostentation of a believer who
addresses himself to the Creator. H ow can one dare so much? And
how could modesty be a virtue of temples , when a decrepit old
woman who imagines Infinity within reach raises herself by prayer
to a level of audacity to which no tyrant has ever laid claim?
I should sacrifice the world's empire for one single moment when

riddles and our banalities. Yet this moment constitutes the common
quality - and in a sense the

official

time - of any believer. But the

man who is truly modest keeps repeating to himself: 'Too humble
to pray, too inert to step across the church threshold, I resign myself
to my shadow, and seek no capitulation from God before my
prayers . ' And to those who offer him immortality he replies : 'My
pride is not inexhaustible: its resources are limited. You imagine, in
the name of faith, that you are conquering your

self;

in fact, you

notion of universal vanity, nor conclusion; and as far as we venture
in such ruminations, our knowledge makes no gain: it is in its present
state as rich and as void as at its point of departure. It is a surcease
within the incurable, a leprosy of the mind, a revelation by stupor.
A simple-minded person, an idiot who has experienced an illumin­
ation and grown used to it with no means of leaving it behind, of
recovering his vague and comfortable condition - such is the state
of the man who finds himself committed in spite of himself to the
perception of universal futility. Abandoned by his nights, virtually
a victim of a lucidity which smothers him, what is he to do with
this day which never manages to end? When will the light stop
shedding its beams, deadly to the memory of a night world anterior
to all that was? How far away chaos is, restful and calm, the chaos
dating from before the terrible Creation, or sweeter still, the chaos
of mental nothingness!

Defense of Corruption

If we put in one pan the evil the 'pure' have poured out upon the
world, and in the other the evil that has come from men without
principles and without scruples, the scale would tip toward the
first.
In the mind that proposes it, every recipe for salvation erects a
guillotine . . . The disasters of corrupt periods have less gravity than
the scourges caused by the ardent ones; mud is more agreeable than
blood; and there is more mildness in vice than in virtue , m ore
humanity in depravity than in austerity. The man who rules and
believes in nothing - behold the model of a paradise of forfeiture,
a sovereign solution to history. Opportunists have saved nations;
heroes have ruined them. To feel that one is a contemporary not of
the Revolution and of Bonaparte, but of Fouche and of Talleyrand:

the essence of life, of showing us that everything is onlyfarce or gall

when men's minds, forgetting the constructive delirium, let them­
selves slip back into the dissolution of morals, of ideals, and of
beliefs. To know is to see; it is neither to hope nor to try.
The stupidity which characterizes history's peaks has no equiva­
lent but the ineptitude of those who are its agents. It is out of a lack
of finesse that we carry our actions and our thoughts to their conclu­
sions. A detached mind shrinks from tragedy and apotheosis:
disgraces and palms exasperate such a spirit as much as banality. To
go toofar is to give an infallible proof of bad taste. The aesthete has
a horror of blood, sublimity, and heroes . . . He still values only the
dissipated . . .

The Obsolete Universe

The aging process in the verbal universe follows a much more accel­
erated rhythm than in the material one. Words, too often repeated,
matter. The mind should have an infinite dictionary, but its means
are limited to a few expressions trivialized by usage. Hence the new,
requiring strange combinations, forces words into unexpected func­
tions: originality is reduced to the torment of the adjective and to the
suggestive impropriety of metaphor. Put words in their place: that is the
everyday graveyard of Speech. What is consecrated in a language
constitutes its death: an anticipated word is a defunct one; only its
artificial use imbues it with a new vigor, until it is commonly adopted,
worn, corrupted . . . The mind is precious or it is not the mind,
whereas nature lolls in the simplicity of its always identical means.
What we call our life , in relation to 'life,' is an incessant creation
of vogues with the help of an artificially manipulated speech; it is
a proliferation of futilities, without which we should have to expire

are tired of seeing and suffering as it was seen and suffered by the
stupidity of our ancestors or of our immediate predecessors. Woe
to the man who, having understood this masquerade, withdraws
from it! He will have encroached upon the secret of his vitality - and
he will j oin the motionless, unaffected truth of those in whom the
wellsprings of the Precious have dried up, and whose mind is
etiolated for want of the artificial.
(It is only too legitimate to imagine the moment when life will no
longer be the fashion, when it will fall into desuetude like the moon
or tuberculosis after the abuses of romanticism: life will then crown
the anachronism of the denuded symbols and the unmasked diseases;
it will once again become

itself:

an ill without prestige, a fatality

without luster. And that moment is only too foreseeable when no
hope will reappear in men's hearts, when the earth will be as glacial
as its creatures , when no dream will come back to embellish the
sterile immensity of it all. Humanity will blush to beget when it
sees things as they are. Life without the sap of mistakes and decep­
tions, life ceasing to be a vogue, will find no clemency at the mind's
tribunal. But finally, that mind itself will give way: it is only an excuse
in the void, as life is only a prej udice.
History sustains itself as long as above our transitory fashions,
of which events are the shadow, a more general fashion floats like
a constant; but when this constant is generally exposed as a simple
whim, when the knowledge of the mistake of living becomes
common property and unanimous truth, where shall we seek
resources in order to engender or even to sketch out an action, the
simulacrum of a gesture? By what art survive our lucid instincts and
our perspicacious hearts? By what miracle reanimate a future temp­
tation in an obsolete universe?)

Decrepit Man
1 no longer want to collab orate with the light or use the jargon o f

life . And 1 shall n o longer say 'I am' without blushing. The immod­
esty of the breath, the scandal of the lungs are linked to the abuse
of an auxiliary verb . . .
The time is past when man thought of himself in terms of a
dawn; behold him resting on an anemic matter, open to his true
duty, the duty of studying his loss, and of rushing into it . . . behold
him on the threshold of a new epoch: the epoch of

Self-Pity.

And

this Pity is his second fall, more distinct and more humiliating than
the first: it is a fall without redemption. Vainly he inspects the hori­
zons: a thousand saviors are silhouetted there , humbug saviors,
themselves unconsoled. He turns away in order to prepare himself,
in his overripe soul, for the sweetness of corruption . . . Having
reached the intimacy of his autumn, he wavers between Appearance
and Nothingness, between the deceptive form of Being and its
absence: vibration between two unrealities . . .
Consciousness occupies the void which follows the mind's erosion
participate in 'reality: which collapses at the approach of the slight­
est doubt, a suspicion of improbability, or a shudder of anguish - so
many rudiments which prefigure consciousness and which, once

developed, beget it, define and exasperate it.

Under the effect of this

consciousness, of this incurable presence, man gains access to his
highest privilege : that of destroying himself. Nature's privileged
patient, man corrupts her sap; abstract vice of the instincts, he
destroys their vigor. The universe withers at his touch and time
decamps . . . He could fulfill himself - and descend the further slope
- only on the wreck of the elements. His work completed, he is ripe
for disappearance; through how many centuries more will his death
rattle sound?

Ideas are substitutes for griefs.
- Marcel Proust

The Second-Hand Thinker
I live in expectation of the Idea; I foresee it, close in upon it, get a
grip - and cannot formulate it, it escapes me, does not yet belong
to me: might I have conceived it in my absence? And how, once
imminent and vague, to make it present and luminous in the intel­
ligible agony of expression? What conditions should I hope for if it
is to bloom - and decay?
Anti-philosopher, I abhor every indifferent idea: I am not always
despondent, hence I do not always think. When I consider ideas, they
seem even more useless than things; hence I have loved only the
elucubrations of the great invalids, the ruminations of insomnia,
the flashes of an incurable fear, and the doubts intersected by sighs.
The amount of chiaroscuro an idea harbors is the only index of its
profundity, as the despairing accent of its playfulness is the index of
its fascination. H ow many white nights does your nocturnal past
conceal? That is how we ought to confront every thinker. The man
who thinks
rather,

when he wants to has nothing to tell us: above - or
alongside his thoughts, he is not responsible for them, not
-

committed to them, neither wins nor loses by risking himself in a
struggle in which he himself is not his own enemy. It costs him
nothing to believe in Truth. Which is not the case for a mind where

true andfalse have ceased to be superstitions; destroyer of all criteria,
such a mind verifies itself, like invalids and poets; it thinks by accident:
the glory of a discomfort or of a delirium suffices. Is not an indiges­
tion richer in ideas than a parade of concepts? Malfunctions of our
organs determine the fruitfulness of our minds: the man who does
not feel his body will never b e in a position to conceive a living

99

A

Short History of Decay

thought; he will wait to no purpose for the advantageous surprise
of some disadvantage . . .
In affective indifference, ideas assume a profile; yet none can take
shape: it is up to melancholy to afford a climate to their blossoming.
They require a certain tonality, a certain color in order to vibrate,
to shine. To be sterile a long time is to lie in wait for them, to yearn
for them without being able to compromise them in a formula. The
mind's 'seasons' are conditioned by an organic rhythm; it is not up
to 'me' to be naive or cynical:

siasm or of my dejection.

my truths are the sophisms of my enthu­

I exist, I feel, and I think according to the

moment - and in spite of myself. Time constitutes me; in vain I
oppose myself - and I

am

.

My undesired present unfolds, unfolds

me; unable to command it, I comment upon it; slave of my thoughts,
I play with them, fatality's buffoon . . .

Advantages of Debility
The individual who fails to transcend his quality as a splendid exam­
ple, a finished model, and whose existence is identified with his vital
destiny, locates himself outside the mind. Ideal masculinity - obstade to the pcrccptio� of n1.!��ce

inycl,\Te� an i..�:;cn�itivity to the

aspect of the

everyday supernatural, from which art draws its
substance. The more one is a nature, the less one is an artist. Homo­
geneous, undifferentiated, opaque vigor was idolized by the world
of legends, by the fantasies of mythology. When the Greeks turned
to speculation, the cult of the anemic ephebe replaced that of the
giants; and the heroes themselves, sublime dolts in Homer's time,
became, thanks to tragedy, bearers of torments and doubts incom­
patible with their rough nature .
internal wealth results from conflicts sustained within oneself;
now, the vitality which is entirely self-possessed knows only external
struggle, the attack upon the object. In the male weakened by a
dose of femininity, two tendencies are at grips: by what is passive

in himself he apprehends a whole world of relinquishment; by what

roo

The Second-Hand Thinker
is imperious, he converts his will into law. As long as his instincts
remain unslaked, he concerns only the species; once a secret dissat­
isfaction creeps in, he b ecomes a

conqueror.

The mind justifies,

explains, and excuses him, and classifYing him among the superior
simpletons, abandons him to History's curiosity - the investigation
of stupidity in action . . .
The man whos e existence does not constitute a disease both
vigorous and vague can never establish himself among problems
nor know their dangers. The condition favorable to the search for
truth or for expression is to be found halfway between man and
woman: the gaps in 'virility' are the seat of the mind . . . If the pure
female, whom we can accuse of no sexual or psychic anomaly, is
internally emptier than an animal, the intact male fits the definition
of 'cretin.' Consider any human being who has caught your atten­
tion or roused your fervor: something in his mechanism has been
unhinged to his advantage. We rightly scorn those who have not made
use of their defects, who have not exploited their deficiencies, and
have not been enriched by their losses, as we despise any man who
does not suffer at b eing a man or simply at being. Hence no graver
insult can be inflicted than to call someone 'happy,' no greater flat­
tery than to grant him a 'vein of melancholy' . . . This is because
gaiety is linked to no important action and because, except for the
mad, no one laughs when he is alone.
' Inner life' is the prerogative of the delicate, those tremulous
wretches subj ect to an epilepsy with neither froth nor falling: the
biologically sound being scorns ' depth: is incapable of it, sees in
it a suspect dimension which j eopardizes the spontaneity of his
actions. Nor is he mistaken: with the retreat into the self begins the
individual's drama - his glory and his decline ; isolated from the
anonymous flux, from the utilitarian trickle of life , he frees himself
from

objective goals.

A civilization is 'affected' when its delicate

members set the tone for it; but thanks to them, it has definitively
triumphed OVer nature - and collapses.

An

extreme example of

refinement unites in himself the exalte and the sophist: he no longer
adheres to his impulses, cultivates without crediting them; this is

101

A Short History of Decay
the omniscient debility of twilight ages, prefiguration of man's
eclipse. The delicate allow us to glimpse the moment when janitors

will be tormented by aesthetes' scruples; when farmers, bent double
by doubts, will no longer have the vigor to guide the plow; when
every human being, gnawed by lucidity and drained of instincts,
will be wiped out without the strength to regret the flourishing
darkness of their illusions . . .

The Parasite of Poets
I. There can be no issue in a poet's life . It is from everything he has
not undertaken, from all the moments fed on the inaccessible , that
his power comes to him. If he finds existence a disadvantage, his
expressive faculties are thereby reinforced, his inspiration dilated.
A biography is legitimate only if it focuses the elasticity of a fate,
the sum of variables it contains. But the poet follows a line of fatal­
ity whose rigor nothing inflects. Life belongs to dolts; and it is in
order to fill out the life they have not had that we have invented

the

lives of the poets . . .
Poetry expresses the essence of what cannot be possessed; its
poetic sentiment (though it proceeds from a sector of the lyric
universe in which chance unites, in one and the same bundle, flames
and fatuities) . Who has ever read a song of hope which failed to
inspire a sensation of discomfort, even of disgust? And how sing a
presence, when the

possible

itself is shadowed with vulgarity?

Between poetry and hope, complete incompatibility: hence the poet
is a prey to an ardent decomposition . Who would dare to wonder
how he has experienced life when it is by death that he has been
alive at all? When he succumbs to the temptation of happiness - he
belongs to comedy . . . But if, on the other hand, flames spring up
from his wounds and he sings felicity - that voluptuous incandes­
cence of woe - he rescues himself from the nuance of vulgarity
inherent in any positive accent. Thus a Hblderlin withdrawing to a

I02

The Second-Hand Thinker
dream Greece and transfiguring love by purer intoxications, by those
of unreality . . .
The poet would be an odious deserter of reality if in his flight
he failed to take his suffering alone. Unlike the mystic or the sage,
he cannot escape himself, nor leave the stage of his own obsession:
even his ecstasies are incurable and harbingers of disasters. Unable
to run away, for him everything is possible, except life . . .
II. This is how J recognize an authentic poet: by frequenting him,
living a long time in the intimacy of his work,

something changes in

myself, not so much my inclinations or my tastes as my very blood,
as if a subtle disease had been injected to alter its course, its density
and nature. Valery and Stefan George leave us where we picked
them up, or else make us more demanding on the formal level of
the mind: they are geniuses we have no

need

of, they are merely

artists. But a Shelley, but a Baudelaire , but a Rilke intervene in the
deepest part of our organism which annexes them as it would a
vice. In their vicinity, a body is fortified, then weakens and disinte­
grates. For the poet is an agent of destruction, a virus,

a

disguised

disease and the gravest danger, though a wonderfully vague one ,
for our red corpuscles. To live around him is to feel your blood run
thin, to dream a paradise of anemia, and to hear, in your veins, the
rustle of tears . . .
III. Whereas verse permits everything - you can pour into it tears,
shames, ecstasies, complaints above

all - prose forbids you to give

vent, to lament: its conventional abstraction is opposed to overflOwing.
Prose requires other truths: verifiable, deduced, measured. But what
if you were to steal those of poetry, if you pillaged its substance and
dared as much as the p oets? Why not insinuate into discourse their
indecencies, their humiliations, their grimaces, and their sighs? Why
not be decomposed, rotten, corpse , angel, or Satan in

the language

of the vulgar, and pathetically betray so many aerial and sinister
moods? Much more than in the school of the philosophers, it is in
the academy of poets that we learn the courage of intelligence and

!O3

A Short History of Decay

the audacity to be ourselves. Their 'affirmations' outdo the most
strangely impertinent sayings of the ancient sophists. No one adopts
them: has there ever been a single thinker who went as far as
Baudelaire or who steeled himself to systematize a Lear's howl,
Hamlet's soliloquy? Nietzsche perhaps before his end, but unfortu­
nately he kept harping on his prophet's string . . . And if we looked
among the saints? Certain frenzies of Teresa of Avila or Angela of
Foligno . . . But here we meet God too frequently - God, that consol­
ing blank who, reinforcing their courage, diminishes its quality. To
advance without convictions and alone among the truths is not given
to a man, nor even to a saint; sometimes, though, to a poet . . .
I can imagine a thinker exclaiming in an impulse of pride: 'I'd
like a poet to make his fate out of my thoughts! ' But for such an
aspiration to be legitimate, he himself would have to have frequented
the poets a long time, he would have to have borrowed from them
the joys of malediction, and given back, abstract and completed,
the image of their own defections or their own deliriums; above all
he would have to have succumbed on the threshold of song and, a
living anthem this side of inspiration, to have known the regret of not
being a poet, of not being initiated into the 'science of tears,' the
scourges of the heart, the formal orgies, the immortalities of the
moment . . .

Many times I have dreamed of a melancholy and erudite monster,
versed in all idioms, familiar with numbers and souls alike, who
would wander the world feeding on poisons, fervors, ecstasies,
crossing Persias, Chinas, defunct Indies, and dying Europes - many
times I have dreamed of a friend of the poets who would have known
them all out of his despair at not being one of them.

Tribulations of an Alien

Offspring of some wretched tribe, he prowls the boulevards of the
West. Cherishing one country after the next, he no longer hopes for
any; stuck in a timeless twilight; citizen of the world - and of no

I04

The Second-Hand Thinker

world - he is ineffectual, nameless, powerless . . . Peoples without
a destiny cannot give one to their sons who, thirsting for other
horizons, attach themselves to a fate and ultimately exhaust it to
finish their days as ghosts of their admirations and their exhaustions.
Having nothing to love at home, they locate their love elsewhere, in
other lands, where their fervor astonishes the natives. Overworked,
the feelings erode and disintegrate, admiration first of all . . . And
the Alien who dispersed himself on so many highways of the world,
exclaims: 'I have set up countless idols for myself, have raised too
many altars everywhere, and I have knelt before a host of gods. Now,
weary of worship, I have squandered my share of delirium. One
has resources only for the absolutes of one's breed; a soul - like a
country - flourishes only within its frontiers. I am paying for having
crossed them, for having made the Indefinite into a fatherland, and
foreign divinities into a cult, for having prostrated myself before
ages which excluded my ancestors. Where I come from I can no
longer say: in the temples I am without belief; in the cities, without
ardor; among my kind, without curiosity; on the earth, without
certitudes. Give me a specific desire and I could shake the world to
its foundations. Release me from this shame of actions which makes
me perform, every morning, the farce of resurrection and, every
night, that of entombment; in the interval, nothing but this torment
in the shroud of ennui . . . I dream of wanting - and all I want seems
to me worthless. Like a vandal corroded by melancholy, I proceed
without a goal, self without a self, toward some unknown corner
. . . in order to discover an abandoned god, a god who is his own
atheist, and to fall asleep in the shadow of his last doubts and his
last miracles.'

Ennui of Conquerors

Paris weighed on Napoleon, by his own admission, like a 'leaden
garment' : for which ten million men were to die. This is the balance
sheet of the mal du sUcle when a Rene on horseback becomes its

105

A Short History of Decay

agent. Born of the idleness of the eighteenth-century salons, this
disease, in the indolence of an over-lucid aristocracy; extended its
ravages deep into the countryside: peasants were to pay with their
blood for a mode of sensibility alien to their nature and, with them,
a whole continent. The exceptional natures in which Ennui insinu­
ated itself, horrified by any one place and obsessed by a perpetual
elsewhere, exploited the enthusiasm of the nations only to multiply
their graveyards. This condottiere who wept over Werther and Ossian,
this Obermann who projected his void into space and who, accord­
ing to Josephine, was capable of no more than a few moments of
abandon, had as his unavowed mission to depopulate the earth. The
dreaming conqueror is the greatest calamity for men; they are no
less eager to idolize him, fascinated as they are by distorted projects,
ruinous ideals, unhealthy ambitions. No reasonable being was ever
the object of worship, left a name, or marked a single event with
his individual stamp. Imperturbable before a precise conception or
a transparent idol, the mob is roused by the unverifiable, by false
mysteries. Who ever died in the name of rigor? Each generation
raises monuments to the executioners of the one which preceded
it. It is nonetheless true that the victims were willing enough to be
immolated once they believed in glory, in that victory of one man
alone, that defe:!t �£ :111 . . .
Humanity adores only those who cause it to perish. Reigns in which
citizens died in their sleep do not figure in history; nor the wise
prince, inveterately scorned by his subjects; the crowd loves the
fictive, even at its expense, the scandal of behavior constituting the
web of human curiosity and the underground current of every
event. The unfaithful woman and the cuckold provide comedy and
tragedy, even the epic, the quasi-totality of their motifs. Since virtue
has neither biography nor charm, from the fliad to vaudeville, only
the luster of dishonor has entertained and intrigued. Hence it is
quite natural that humanity should have offered itself up to the
conquerors, that it should seek to be trampled underfoot, that a
nation without tyrants should never be talked about, that the sum of
iniquities a people commits should be the sole index of its presence

106

The Second-Hand Thinker

and of its vitality. A nation which no longer rapes is in its decadence;
the number of rapes reveals its instincts, and its future . Find out in
which war it has stopped practicing, on a large scale, this variety of
crime: you will have found the first symbol of its decline; find out
at what moment love has become for a nation a ceremonial, and
the bed a condition of orgasm, and you will identity the beginning
of its deficiencies and the end of its barbaric inheritance.
Universal history: history of Evil. Take away the disasters from
human evolution and you might as well conceive of nature without
seasons. If you have not contributed to a catastrophe, you will vanish
without a trace. We interest others by the misfortune we spread
around us. 'I never made anyone suffer!' - an exclamation forever
alien to a creature of flesh and blood. When we feel enthusiasm for
a character of the past, or the present, we unconsciously ask ourselves:
'For how many people was he the cause of disaster?' Who knows
if each of us doesn't aspire to the privilege of killing all his kind?
But this privilege is assigned to very few, and never integrally: this
restriction alone explainS why the earth is still inhabited. Indirect
murderers, we constitute an inert mass, a multitude of objects
confronting Time's true subjects, the great criminals who came to
something.
But we can take comfort: our descendants, remote or immediate,
will avenge us. For it is not difficult to imagine the moment when
men will cut each other's throats out of disgust with themselves,
when Ennui will get the best of their prejudices and their diffidences,
when they will run out into the street to slake their thirst for blood,
and when the destructive dream prolonged for so many generations
will become the universal reality . . .

Music and Skepticism

I have searched for Doubt in all the arts, have found it there only
disguised, furtive, breaking out during the entr'actes of inspiration,
rising from slackened impulse; but I have given up searching for it

107

A Short History of Decay

- even in this form - in music; it cannot bloom there: ignorant of
irony, music proceeds not from the pranks of the intellect but from
the tender or vehement nuances of NaYvete, stupidity of the sublime,
heedlessness of the infinite . . . Wit having no equivalent in sound,
we denigrate a musician by calling him intelligent. This attribute
diminishes him and is not suitable in that languorous cosmogony
where, like a blind god, he improvises one universe after another.
If he were conscious of his gift, of his genius, he would succumb
to pride; but he is not responsible for it; born in the oracle, he cannot
understand himself. Let the sterile interpret him: he is not a critic,
as God is not a theologian.
Limit-case of unreality and the absolute, infinitely real fiction, a
lie more authentic than the world, music loses its prestige as soon
as, dry or morose, we dissociate ourselves from the Creation, and
Bach himself seems no more than insipid rumors; this is the extreme
point of our non-participation in things, of our coldness and our
collapse. To jeer amid the sublime sardonic victory of the subjective
principle, and one which makes us members of the Devil's brood!
Lost is the man who has no more tears for music, who lives now
only by the memory of those he has shed: sterile lucidity will have
vanquished ecstasy - which once created worlds . . .
-

The Automaton
I breathe out of prejudice. And I contemplate the spasm of ideas,
while the Void smiles at itself . . . No more sweat in space, no more
life; the least vulgarity will make it reappear: a second's waiting will
suffice.
When we perceive ourselves existing we have the sensation of a
stupefied madman who surprises his own lunacy and vainly seeks
to give it a name. Habituation blunts our amazement at being: we
are - and move on, we go back to our place in the asylum of the
existing.
A conformist, I live, I try to live, by imitation, by respect for the

108

The Second-Hand Thinker

rules of the game, by horror of originality. An automaton's resigna­
tion: to affect a pretense of fervor and secretly to laugh at it; to bow
to conventions only to repudiate them on the sly; to be numbered
in every ledger but to have no residence in time; to save face whereas
it would be only duty to lose it .

.

.

The man who scorns everything must assume an air of perfect
dignity, deceive the others and even himself: thereby he will the
more easily accomplish his task of counteifeit living. What use display­
ing your failure when you can feign prosperity? Hell lacks

manners:

it is the exasperated image of a frank and uncouth man, it is the
earth conceived without one superstition of elegance and civility.
I accept life out of politeness: perpetual rebellion is in bad taste,
as is the sublimity of suicide. At twenty we rage against the heavens
and the filth they hide; then we grow tired of it. The tragic attitude
suits only an extended and ridiculous puberty; but it takes a thousand
ordeals to achieve the histrionics of detachment.
The man who, lib erated from all the principles of custom, lacks
any gift as an actor is the archetype of wretchedness, the ideally
unhappy being. No use constructing this model of ingenuousness:

life is tolerable only by the degree of mystification we endow it with.

Such

a model would be the immediate ruin of society, the 'pleasure' o f
communal life residing i n the impossibility o f giving free rein to the
infinity of our ulterior motives. It is because we are all impostors
that we endure each other. The man who does not consent to lie
will see the earth shrink under his feet: we are

biologically obliged

to the false. No moral hero who is not childish, ineffectual, or in­
authentic; for true authenticity is the flaw in fraud, in the proprieties
of public flattery and secret defamation. If our fellow men could
be aware of our opinions about them, love, friendship, and devotion
would be forever erased from the dictionaries and if we had the
courage to confront the doubts we timidly conceive about ourselves,
none of us would utter an T without shame. Masquerade rules all
the living, from the troglodyte to the skeptic. Since only the respect
for appearances separates us from carrion, it is death to consider
the basis of things, of beings; let us abide by a more agreeable

109

A

Short History of Decay

nothingness: our constitution tolerates only a certain dosage of
truth . . .
Let us keep deep down inside a certitude superior to all the
others: life has no meaning, it cannot have any such thing. We should
kill ourselves on the spot if an unlooked for revelation persuaded
us of the contrary. The air gone , we should still breathe; but we
should immediately smother if the j oy of inanity were taken from
us . . .

On Melancholy
When we cannot be delivered from ourselves, we delight in devour­
ing ourselves. In vain we call upon the Lord of Shades, the bestower
of a precise curse: we are invalids without disease , and reprobates
without vices. Melancholy is the dream state of egoism: no longer any
obj ect outside oneself, no reason for hate or love, but that same fall
into a languid mud, that same circling of the damned without a hell,
those same reiterations o f a zeal to perish . . . Whereas sadness is
content with a circumstantial c ontext, melancholy requires a
debauch of space, an infinite landscape in order to spread out its

sullen �!!d ".T?�P0!0""!� g!'�!:e, its sh2peless evil, 'l:."J;.Thi�h, fe:!ri!!g tc
recover, dreads any limit to its dissolution and its undulation. It
expands - strangest flower of self-love - among the poisons from
which it extracts its vital juices and the vigor of all its failures . Feed­
ing on what corrupts it, melancholy hides, under its melodious
name, Self-Commiseration and the Pride of Defeat . . .

The Thirst for Power
A Caesar is closer to a village mayor than to a mind sovereignly lucid

but lacking the instinct of domination. The important fact is to
command: almost all men aspire to this. Whether you have in your
hands an empire, a tribe, a family, or a servant, you deploy your

lIO

The Second-Hand Thinker
talent as a tyrant, glorious or absurd: a whole world or a single
person obeys your orders_ Thus is established the series of calamities
which rise from the need, the thirst to excel . . . We jostle none but
satraps : each of us - according to his means - seeks out a host of
slaves or is content with just one . No one is self-sufficient: the most
modest of men will always find a friend or a companion to authen­
ticate his dream of authOrity. The man who obeys will be obeyed
in his turn: the victim will become the executioner; this is the
supreme desire - universally. Only beggars and sages do not experi­
ence it; unless theirs is an even subtler game . . .
The thirst for power permits History to renew itself and yet to
remain basically the same; religions try to oppose this appetite, but
manage only to exasperate it. Christianity would have found an issue
whether the earth was a desert or a paradise. Under the variable
forms man can assume is concealed one constant , an identical
basis which explains why, against all the appearances of change , we
move in a circle - and why, if we lost, following some supernatural
intervention, our quality as monsters and clowns, history would
immediately vanish.
Try to be free : you will die of hunger. Society tolerates you only
if you are successively servile and despotic; it is a prison without
guards - but from which you do not escape without dying. Where
to go, when you can live only in the city and you lack the instincts
for doing so, and when you are not enterprising enough to beg your
bread, nor balanced enough to give yourself up to wisdom? In the
end, you stay there like everyone else, pretending to busy yourself;
you convince yourself of this extremity by the resources of artifice ,
since i t i s less absurd t o simulate life than t o live it.
As long as men have the passion of the city, a disguised cannibal­
ism will rule there . The political instinct is the direct consequence
of Sin, the immediate materialization of the Fall. Each man should
be assigned to his solitude , but each man keeps an eye on that of
everyone else. Angels and bandits have their leaders; how could the
intermediary creature - the very texture of humanity - lack theirs?
Take away their desire to be slaves or tyrants and you demolish the

III

A Short History of Decay

city in the wink of an eye. The monkey-pact is sealed forever; and
history follows its course, the horde gasping between crimes and
dreams. Nothing can arrest it: even those who execrate it participate
in its progress . . .

Position of the Poor

Owners and beggars: two categories which oppose any change,
any renewing disorder. Placed at the two extremities of the social
ladder, they fear any modification in good and evil: they are equally
settled, the former in opulence, the latter in destitution. Between
them are located - anonymous sweat, the basis of society - those
who strive, labor, persevere, and cultivate the absurdity of hope.
The State feeds on their anemia; the notion of citizen would have
neither content nor reality without them, any more than luxury
and alms: the rich man and the beggar are parasites of the poor,
the Pauper's dependents.
If misery has a thousand remedies, poverty has none. How succor
those who persist in not dying of hunger? God himself could not
correct their lot. Between fortune's darlings and the tatterdemalion
circulate these h0�0!'2.ble st2.!",.Teli�g�, e4?lGited by �plcndc� ��d by
rags, pillaged by those who, loathing labor, settle, according to their
luck or their vocation, in the salon or the gutter. And so humanity
advances: with a few rich men, with a few beggars - and with all its
poor . . .

Faces of Decadence

The weariness of long-forgotten peoples
Hangs heavy on my eyelids.
- Hugo von Hofinannsthal

A civilization b egins to decline the moment Life becomes its sole
obsession. Epochs of apogee cultivate values for their own sake : life
is only a means of realizing them; the individual is not aware of
living, he

lives

-

happy slave of the forms he engenders, tends, and

idolizes. Affectivity dominates and fills him. No creation without
the resources of 'feeling: which are limited; yet for the man who
experiences only their wealth, they seem inexhaustible: this illusion

produces history. In decadence, affective drying-up permits only two
modalities of feeling and understanding: sensation and idea . Now,
it is by affectivity that we participate in the world of values, that
we proj ect a vitality into categories and norms. The activity of a
productive civilization consists in drawing ideas out of their abstract
nothingness, in transforming concepts into myths. The transition from
the anonymous individual to the conscious individual has not yet
been made; yet it is inevitable . Measure it: in Greece, from Homer
to the s ophists; in Rom e , from the austere old Republic to the
'wisdoms' of the Empire; in the modern world, from the cathedrals
to eighteenth-century lace.
A nation cannot create indefinitely. It is called upon to give

expression and meaning to a sum of values which are exhausted
with the soul which has b egotten them. The citizen wakens from a
productive hypnosis; the reign of lucidity begins; the masses wield
no more than empty categories.

Myths turn back into concepts:

that

is decadence. And the consequences make themselves felt: the indi­
vidual wants to live, he converts life into finality, he elevates himself
to the rank of a minor exception. The ledger of these exceptions,

lIS

constituting the deficit of a civilization, prefigures its effacement.
Everyone achieves delicacy - but is it not the radiant stupidity of
the dolts which accomplishes the work of the great periods?
According to Montesquieu, at the end of the Empire the Roman
army consisted entirely of cavalry. But he neglects to supply us with
the reason for this. Imagine the legionary saturated with glory,
wealth, and debauchery after having traversed countless lands and
having lost his faith and his force on contact with so many temples
and vices - imagine such a man onfoot! He has conquered the world
as an infantryman; he will lose it on horseback. Indolence invariably
reveals a physiological incapacity to adhere any longer to the myths
of the City. The emancipated soldier and the lucid citizen succumb
to the barbarian. The

discovery of Life annihilates life .

When an entire nation, a t various levels, is in search o f rare sensa­
tions, when, by the subtleties of taste, it complicates its reflexes, it
has acceded to a fatal pitch of superiority. Decadence is merely
instinct gone impure under the action of consciousness. Hence we
cannot overestimate the importance of gastronomy in the existence
of a collectivity. The conscious act of eating is an Alexandrian phenom­
enon; barbarism .feeds. Intellectual and religious eclecticism, sensual
ingenuity, aestheticism, and the learned obsession of good living are
the various sign� of one 2.!!d !...�e ��!!! e form of �i..�d. \\'hen. C abil!.�
Apicius explored the African coast for lobsters, without s ettling
anywhere because he found none to his taste, he was a contemporary
of the uneasy souls who worshippe d the host of alien gods without
finding satisfaction or rest among them. Rare sensations - diverse deities,
parallel fruits of the same dryness, of the same curiosity without
inner resources. Christianity appeared: a single God - andfasting. And
an

age of triviality and the Sublime began .

.

.

A nation dies when it no longer has the strength to invent new
gods, new myths, new absurdities ; its idols blur and vanish; it seeks
them elsewhere, and feels alone before unknown monsters. This
too is decadence. But if one of these monsters prevails, another world
sets itself in motion, crude, dim, intolerant, until it exhausts its god
and emancipates itself from him; for man is free - and sterile - only

n6

in the interval when the gods die; slave - and creative - only in the
interval when, as tyrants, they flourish.
To meditate upon one's sensations - to

know

one is eating - is an

accession of consciousness by which an elementary action transcends
its immediate goal. Alongside intellectual disgust develops another,
deeper and more dangerous: emanating from the viscera, it ends at
the severest form of nihilism, the nihilism of repletion. The bitterest
considerations cannot compare, in their effects, with the vision follow­
ing an opulent banquet. Every meal which exceeds, in time, a few
minutes and, in dishes, the necessities disintegrates our certitudes.
Culinary abuse and satiety destroyed the Empire more pitilessly than
the Oriental sects and the ill-assimilated Greek doctrines. We experi­
ence an authentic shudder of skepticism only around a copious table.
The Kingdom of Heaven must have represented a temptation after
such excesses or a deliciously perverse surprise in the monotony of
digestion. Hunger seeks a way to salvation in religion; satiety, a poison.
To be 'saved' by viruses, and, in the indiscrimination of prayers and
vices, to flee the world and wallow in it by the same action . . . that
is indeed the apex of acrimony and of Alexandrianism.
There is a

plenitude of decline

in every overripe civilization, In­

stincts slacken; pleasures dilate and no longer correspond to their
biological function; the voluptuous becomes an end in itself, its
prolongation an art, the avoidance of orgasm a technique, sexuality
a science. Methods and literary inspirations to multiply the channels
of desire, the imagination tormented in order to diversify the prelim­
inaries of release, the mind itself involved in a realm alien to its
nature and over which it should have no purchase - all so many
symptoms of the impoverishment of the blood and the morbid
intellectualization of the flesh. Love conceived as a ritual makes the
intelligence sovereign in the empire of stupidity. Our automatisms
suffer for it; shackled, they lose that impatience to let loose an
inadmissible contortion; the nerves become the theater of lucid
discomforts and shudders,

sensation in short extends beyond its crude

duration thanks to the skill of two torturers of studied voluptuous­
ness. They are

the individual who deceives the species

and the blood

too tepid to stun the mind, the bloo d chilled and thinned by ideas,

the rational blood .

. .

Instincts eroded by conversation . . .
Nothing monumental has ever emerged from dialogue, nothing
explosive , nothing 'great.' If humanity had not indulged in discuss­
ing its own strength, it would never have exceeded Homer's vision,
and his models. But dialectics, ravaging the spontaneity of reflexes
and the spirit of myths, has reduced the hero to a tottering example.
Today's Achilles has more than a heel to worry about . . . Vulner­
ability, once partial and of no consequence, has become the accursed
privilege, the essence of each being. C onsciousness has made its
way everywhere, residing in the very marrow of our bones; hence
man no longer lives in existence , but in the

theory of existence

. . .

The dear-sighted person who understands himself, explains
himself, justifies himself, and dominates his actions will never make
a memorable gesture .

Psychology is the hero's grave .

The millennia

of religion and reasoning have weakened muscles, decisions, and
the impulse of risk. How keep from scorning the enterprise s of

glory? Every act

v,tc.

vvhich

the wind's luminous i1ialcdiction fails

to preside represents a vestige of ancestral stupidity. Ideologies were
invented only to give a luster to the leftover barbarism which has
survived down through the ages , to cover up the murderous tenden­
cies common to all men. Today we kill in the name of something;
we

no longer dare do so spontaneously; so that the very execution­

ers must invoke motives, and, heroism being obsolete, the man who
is tempted by it solves a problem more than he performs a sacrifice.

Abstraction

has insinuated itself into life - and into death; the

'complexes' seize great and small alike. From the Iliad to psychopath­
ology - there you have all of human history.
In civilizations on the wane, twilight is the sign of a noble punish­
ment. What ecstasy of irony they must experience upon seeing

themselves excluded from Becoming, after having established for
centuries the norms of power and the criteria of taste! With each
of them, a whole world goes out. Sensations of the last Greek, the
last Roman! Who can keep from falling in love with the great
sunsets? The charm of agony surrounding a civilization, after it has
confronted every problem and marvelously warped them, offers
more seductions than the inviolate ignorance by which that civiliza­
tion began.
Each civilization represents an answer to the que stions the
universe proposes; but the mystery remains intact; new civilizations,
with new curiosities, will come to try their luck, quite as vainly, each
of them being merely a system of mistakes

...

At the apogee, we beget values; at twilight, worn and defeated,
we abolish them. Fascination of decadence - of the ages when the
truths have no further life . . . when they pile up like skeletons in
the desiccated, pensive soul, in the boneyard of dreams . . .
How dear to me that Alexandrian philosopher named Olimpius,
who hearing a voice singing the Hallelujah in the Serapion, went
into exile forever! This was toward the end of the fourth century;
already the lugubrious stupidity of the Cross was casting its shadows
across the Mind.
Around the same period, Palladas the grammarian could write :
'We Greeks are no more than ashes today. Our hopes are buried like
those of the dead . ' And this is true for all intellects of that tim e .
vainly a C elsus, a Porphyry, a Julian the Apostate strives t o halt
the invasion of that nebulous Sublime which overflows the cata­
combs: the apostles have left their stigmata in men's souls and
multiplied their ravages in the cities. The age of the great Ugliness
begins; hysteria without quality spreads over the world. Saint Paul
- the most considerable vote-canvasser of all time - has made his
tours, infesting the clarity of the ancient twilight with his epistles.
An epileptic triumphs over five centuries of philosophy! Reason is
confiscated by the fathers of the Church!
And if I were to look for the most mortifYing date for the mind's
pride, if I were to scan the inventory of intolerances, I would find

II9

nothing comparable to the year 529, when, following Justinian's
decree, the School of Athens was closed. The right to decadence
being officially suppressed,

to believe became an obligation .

. . This

is the most painful moment in the history of Doubt.
When a nation no longer has any prejudice in its blood, its sole
resource remains its will to disintegrate. Imitating music, that dis­
cipline of dissolution, it makes its farewells to the passions, to lyric
waste , to sentimentality, to blindness. Henceforth it can no longer
worship without irony: the

sense of distances will be its lot forever.

Prejudice is an organic truth, false in itself but accumulated by
generations and transmitted: we cannot rid ourselves of it with
impunity. The nation that renounces it heedlessly will then renounce
itself until it has nothing left to give up. The duration of a collectiv­
ity and its consistency coincide with the duration and consistency

of its prejudices. The Oriental nations owe their everlastingness to
their loyalty to themselves: having failed to 'develop, ' they have not
betrayed themselves; and they have not
life is conceived by civilizations

lived in the sense in which
on the run, the only ones history is

concerned with; for history, discipline of dawns and of gasping
deathbeds - history is a novel laying claim to rigor and which draws
it:; substance from the archives of

the blood . . .

Alexandrianism is a period of skilful negations, a style of inutility
and refusal, a display of erudition and sarcasm above the confusion
of values and beliefs. Its ideal space would be at the intersection of
Hellas and bygone Paris, the meeting place of the agora and the
salon. A civilization evolves from agriculture to paradox. Between
these two extremes unfolds the combat of barbarism and neurosis;
from it results the unstable e quilibrium of creative epochs. This
combat is approaching its clos e : all horizons are opening without
any being able to excite an exhausted and disabused curiosity. It is
then up to the enlightened individual to flourish in the void - up to
the intellectual vampire to slake his thirst on the vitiated blood of
civilizations.

Faces of Decadence
Must we take history seriously, or stand on the sidelines as a
spectator? Are we to see it as a struggle toward a goal or the celebra­
tion of a light which intensifies and fades with neither necessity nor
reason? The answer depends on our degree of illusion about man,
on our curiosity to divine the way in which will be resolved that
mixture of waltz and slaughterhouse which composes and stimu­
lates his becoming.
There is a

Weltschmerz, a mal du siecle, which is merely the illness of

a generation; there is another which follows upon all historical
experience and which becomes the unavoidable conclusion for the
time to come. This is what the French call vague a l' arne,

a

melancholy

yearning for the end of the world. Everything changes its aspect,
even the sun; everything ages, even disaster . . .
Incapable of rhetoric, we are romantics of lucid disappointment.
Today, Werther, M anfred, Rene know their disease and display it
without ceremony. Biology, physiology, psychology - grotesque
names which, suppressing the naIvete of our despair and introducing
analysis into our songs, bring us to scorn all declamation. Disciplined
by the various

Treatises, our scholarly acerbities explain our shames

and classify our frenzies.
When consciousness succeeds in sounding all our secrets, when
our misery has been drained of its last vestige of mystery, will we
still have any fever and exaltation left to contemplate the wreck of
existence and of poetry?
To bear the weight of history, the burden of becoming and that load
under which consciousness sags when it considers the sum and the
inanity of past or possible events . . . In vain nostalgia invokes an
impulse ignorant of the lessons taught by all that has ever been;
there is a weariness for which the future itself is a cemetery, a poten­
tial cemetery as is everything which awaits being. The centuries
have grown heavy and weigh upon the moment. We are more
corrupt than all the ages, more decomposed than all the empires.
Our exhaustion interprets history, our breathlessness makes us

I2I

A

hear the death rattle of nations. Chlorotic comedians, we prepare
ourselves for the stand-in parts in the hackneyed stories, the well­
worn periods: the curtain of the universe is moth-eaten, and through
its holes we see nothing, now, but masks and ghosts . . .
The mistake of those who apprehend decadence is to try to oppose
it whereas it must be encouraged: by developing it exhausts itself
and permits the advent of other forms. The true harbinger is not
the man who offers a system when no one wants it, but rather the
man who precipitates Chaos, its agent and incense-bearer. It is vulgar
to trumpet dogmas in extenuated ages when any dream of the future
seems a dream or an imposture . To make for the end of time with
a flower in one's buttonhole - the sole comportment worthy of us
in time's passage. A pity there is no such thing as a Last Judgment,
no occasion for a great defiance! Believers: hamfatters of eternity;
faith: craving for a timeless stage

.

.

.

But we unbelievers, we die with

our decors, and too tired out to deceive ourselves with blazonry
promised to our corpses . . .
According to Meister Eckhart,

divinity

precedes God, being His

essence , his unfathomable depth. What should we find at man's
inmost core which defines his substance in OprOS!!!on !o the
divine essence? Neurasthenia

-

which is to man what divinity is to

God.
We live in a climate of exhaustion : the act of creation, o f
making and producing, is less significant in and of itself than in
relation to the void, to the fall which follows . . . For our invariably
compromised efforts, the divine and inexhaustible depths are situ­
ated outside the field of our concepts and our sensations. Man was
born with the vocation of fatigue : when he adopted the vertical
posture and thereby diminished his possibilities of support, he was
doomed to weaknesses unknown to the animal he was . To carry
on two legs so much substance and all the disgusts related to it!
The generations accumulate weariness and transmit it; our fathers
bequeath to us a patrimony of anemia, reserves of discourage-

122

Faces of Decadence
ment, resources of decomposition, and an energy in dying which
becomes more p owerful than our instincts to live . And it is in this
fashion that the habitude of disappearing, propped on our capital
of fatigue , will permit us to realize, in the prolix flesh, neurasthe­
nia - our essence .

.

.

No need to believe in a truth to sustain it nor to love a period to
justify it, every principle being demonstrable and every event legit­
imate . The sum of phenomena - whether fruits of the mind or of
time - can b e embraced or denied according to our mood of the
moment: arguments, proceeding from our rigor or from our whims,
are of equal weight on e ach point. Nothing is indefensible - from
the absurdest proposition to the most monstrous crime. The history
of ideas, like that of deeds, unfolds in a meaningless climate; who
could in good faith find an arbiter who would settle the litigations
of these anemic or bloodthirsty gorillas? This earth, a place where
we can confirm anything with an equal likelihood: here axioms and
frenzies are interchangeable; impulses and collapses are identified;
exaltations and depravities participate in the same movement. Show
me a single

case in support of which nothing can be found .

. . The

advocates of hell have no fewer claims on the truth than those of
heaven - and I should plead the cause of madman and sage with
the same fervor. Time deals corruption to all that manifests itself,
all that acts: an idea or an event, becoming real, assumes a counten­
ance and . . . disintegrates . Hence, when the mob of beings was
stirred, History was the result, and with it the one pure desire it has
inspired: that it come to an end, one way or another.
Too m ature for new dawns, and having included too many
centuries to crave more , all that remains for us is to wallow in the
slag of civilizations. The march of time now seduces only the callow
and the fanatic .

.

.

We are the great invalids, overwhelmed by old dreams, forever
incapable of utopia, technicians of lassitude, gravediggers of the
future, horrified by the avatars of the Old Adam. The Tree of Life
will no longer have spring as one of its seasons: so much dry wood;

123

A

Short History of Decay

out of it will be made coffins for our bones, our dreams, and our
griefs . Our flesh inherited the smell of lovely carrion scattered in
the millennia. Their glory fascinated us; we exhausted it. In the
Mind's graveyard lie the principles and the formulas: the Beautiful
is defined, and interred there. And like it the True, the Good, Know­
ledge , and the Gods - they are all rotting there . (History: a context
in which the capital letters decompose, and with them, the men
who imagine and cherish them.)
. . . I stroll there . Under this cross Truth sleeps its last sleep; beside
it, Charm; further on, Rigor; and over a host of slabs covered with
deliriums and hypotheses rises the mausoleum of the Absolute; in
it lie the false consolations and the deceptive zeniths of the soul.
But, still higher, crowning this silence, soars Error - and halts the
steps of the funereal sophist.
Since man's existence is the most considerable and the strangest
venture nature has known, it is inevitable that it should also be the
shortest; its end is foreseeable and desirable: to extend it indefinitely
would be indecent. Having entered upon the risks of his exception,
the paradoxical animal will still play, for c enturies and even for
millennia, his last card. Must we complain of that? No question that
he will never �q-:.l�! 1'..i:; P;lst g1cric:;, nctt..i.g
.� Sllggcst:; that hi:; p0ssibilities will some day provoke a rival for Bach or for Shakespeare .
Decadence is first manifest in the arts; 'civilization' survives their
decomposition a certain tim e . Such will be man's case : he will
continue his exploits, but his spiritual resources will have dried up,
as will his freshness of inspiration. The thirst for power and domin­
ation has taken over too much of his soul: when he is master of all,
he will be none the more so of his own end. Not yet being the
possessor of all the means to destroy and to destroy himself, he will
not perish forthwith; but it is indubitable that he will create for
himself an instrument of total annihilation before discovering a
panacea, which moreover does not appear to be one of nature's
possibilities. He will annihilate himself as a creator - are we to
conclude that all men will vanish from the earth? We must not look

I24

Faces of Decadence
at the situation through rose-colored glasses. A good proportion,
the survivors, will linger on, a race of subhumans, gate-crashers of
the apocalypse .

.

.

The imagination readily conceives a future in which men will
exclaim in chorus: 'We are the last: weary of the future and even
wearier of ourselves, we have squeezed out the juice from the earth
and stripped b are the heavens. Neither spirit nor matter can still
nourish our dreams: this universe is as desiccated as our hearts. No
substance remains anywhere: our ancestors bequeathed us their
tattered soul and their worm-eaten marrow. The venture is at an
end; consciousness is expiring; our songs have fallen still; there
gleams the sun of the dying! '
If, b y accident or miracle, words were t o disappear, we should b e
plunged into an intolerable anguish and stupor. Such sudden dumbness
would expose us to the cruelest torment. It is the use of concepts which
makes us masters of our fears. We say: Death - and this abstraction
releases us from experiencing its infinity, its horror. By baptizing events
and things, we elude the Inexplicable: the mind's activity is a salutary
deception, a conjuring trick; it allows us to circulate in a tempered
reality, comfortable and inexact. To learn to wield concepts - unlearn
to look at things . . . Reflection was born on a day of evasion; the
consequence was verbal splendor. But when we return to ourselves
and we

are

alone -

without the company of words

-

we rediscover the

unqualified universe, the pure obj ect, the naked event; where find the
boldness to face them? We no longer speculate about death, we

are

death; instead of embellishing life and assigning it goals, we strip it
of its finery and reduce it to its true meaning:

a euphemism for Evil.

The grand expressions - fate, misfortune, disgrace - lose their luster;
and it is then that we see the creature at grips with failing organs,
vanquished under a prostrate and dumbfounded substance. Take the
lie of Misery away from man, give him the power to look under this
word: he cannot, for one moment, endure his misery. It is abstraction,
sonorities without content, swollen and dilapidated, which have kept

him from foundering, and not his religions and instincts.

125

A Short History of Decay
When Adam was expelled from paradise, instead of vituperating
his persecutor, he busied himself baptizing things: this was his sole
way of accommodating himself to them and forgetting them ; the
basis of idealism was established. And what was only a gesture , a
defense reaction in the first stammerer, became theory in Plato,
Kant, and Hegel.
In order not to be overwhelmed by our accident, we convert even
our name into an entity: how can we die when we are called Peter
or Paul? Each of us, more attentive to the immutable appearance
of his name than to the fragility of his being, gives himself up to
an illusion of immortality; once the articulation blurs, we are quite
alone; the mystic who weds silence has renounced his creature
condition. Imagine him, further, without faith - a nihilist mystic and we have the disastrous consummation of the earthly venture .
. . . It is only too natural to think that man, weary of words,
impatient with the iterations of time, will debaptize things and cast
their names and his own into a great auto-da-fe that will engulf his
hopes. We all race toward this final model, toward man mute and
naked . . .
I feel Life's age , its old age, its decrepitude. For incalculable epochs,
Life has circled the surface of the globe by the mira::!::: cf that fab:::
immortality which is inertia; it has lingered in the rheumatisms of
Time, in that time older than itself, exhausted by a senile delirium,
by the endless sifting of its moments, of its doting duration.
And I feel all the weight of the race, and I have assumed all its
solitude. If only it would vanish! - but its agony extends toward an
eternity of corruption. I leave each moment the latitude to destroy
me: not to blush at breathing is the act of a cad. No more pacts with
life, no more pacts with death: having unlearned being, I consent
to be effaced. Becoming - what a crime!
Having passed through so many lungs, the air no longer renews
itself. Every day vomits up its tomorrow, and I vainly try to imagine
the image of a single desire . Everything is an ordeal: broken down
like a beast of burden harnessed to Matter, I drag the planets.

I26

Faces of Decadence
Give me another universe - or I succumb.
All I like is the explosion and the collapse of things, the fire which
provokes them and the fire which devours them. The world's dur­
ation exasperates m e ; its birth and its disappearance delight . . . To
live under the fascination of the virginal sun and the decrepit one;
to skip the pulsations of time in order to grasp the original one and
the ultimate . . . to dream of the improvisation of the stars and of
their extinction; to disdain the routine of being and to rush toward
the two abysses which threaten it; to exhaust oneself at the begin­
ning and at the conclusion of the moments . . .
Thus one discovers the Savage and the Decadent in oneself, a
predestined and contradictory cohabitation: two characters suffer­
ing the same attraction for passage, the one of nothingness toward
the world, the other of the world toward nothingness: it is the need
for a double convulsion, on

the metaphysical scale.

This need is

expressed, on the historical scale, in the obsession of Adam whom
paradise expelled and in the obsession of the man whom earth will
expel: two extremities of man's

impossibility.

By what is 'profound' in us, we are victims of every evil: no salvation
so long as we still conform to our being.

Something must disappear

from our composition, some deadly spring dry up; hence there is
only one way out:

to abolish the soul, its aspirations and abysses; our

dreams were poisoned by it; we must extirpate it, along with its
craving for ' depth , ' its 'inner' fruitfulness, and its other aberrations.
The mind and sensation will suffice; their concourse will beget a
discipline of sterility which will preserve us from enthusiasm, from
anguish. Let no 'feeling' disturb us ever again, and let the 'soul'
become the silliest of desuetudes . . .

The Refusal to Procreate
Having exhausted his appetites, the man who approaches a limit-form
of detachment no longer wants to perpetuate himself; he loathes
surviving in someone else, to whom moreover he has nothing more
to transmit; the species appalls him; he is a monster - and monsters do
not beget. 'Love' still holds him prisoner: an aberration among his
thoughts. In love he seeks an excuse to return to the common condi­
tion; but the
heredity,

as

child

seems

as

inconceivable to him as the family, as

the laws of nature. With neither profession nor lineage, he

achieves - final hypostasis - his own conclusion. But far as he may be
from fecundity, a more audacious monster outstrips him: the saint, an
example at once fascinating and repellent, with whom we are always
in a false position; his own is clear: no room for doubt, no possible
dilettantism. Having reached the gilded peaks of his disgusts, at the
antipodes of Creation, he has made his nothingness into a halo. Nature
has never known such a calamity: from the viewpoint of perpetuation,
the saint marks an absolute end, a radical denouement. To regret, like
Leon Bloy, that we

are

not all saints is to crave humanity'S disappear­

ance . . . in the name offaith! How positive, on the other hand, the devil
appears, striving to seal us to our imperfections and laboring - despite
himself, betraying his essence - to preserve us! Root out sins and life
withers at once. The follies of procreation will one day vanish - out of
weariness rather than sanctity. Man will be exhausted less for having
tended to perfection than for having squandered himself; then he will
resemble a void saint, and he will be just as far from nature's fruitful­
ness

as

is this model of fulfillment and sterility.

Man engenders only by remaining faithful to the general fate.

Once he approaches the essence of the devil or of the angel, he
becomes sterile or begets abortions. For Raskolnikov, for Ivan Kara­
mazov or Stavrogin, love is no longer anything but an excuse to
accelerate their destruction; and this very excuse vanishes for Kirilov:
he no longer measures himself against men but against God. As for
the Idiot or Alyosha, the fact that the one apes Jesus and the other
the angels places them from the start among the impotent . . .
But to wrest ourselves from the chain of beings and to reject the
notion of ancestry or posterity is nonetheless not to compete with
the saint, whose pride exceeds any earthly dimension. Indeed, under
the decision by which he renounces everything, under the incom­
mensurable explOit of such humility, is concealed a demonic
effervescence: the initial point, the start of sanctity, assumes the style
of a challenge hurled at the human race; subsequently the saint
climbs the ladder of perfection, begins talking about love, about God,
turns toward the humble, intrigues the mob - and annoys us. The

The Aesthete Hagiographer
It is no sign of benediction to have been haunted by the existence
of the saints. This obsession is tainted by a thirst for diseases and a
greed for depravities. You are disturbed about sanctity only if you
have been disappointed by the earthly paradoxes; so then you search
for others, of a stranger purport, imbued with unknown perfumes
and truths; you put your hopes in follies not to be found in everyday
sensations, follies heavy with a celestial exoticism; and so you come
up against the saints, their gestures, their temerity, their universe .
Astounding spectacle! You vow to remain here all your life, to exam­
ine it with a voluptuous devotion, to wrest yourself from other
temptations because at last you have met with the true and the
unheard of. B ehold the aesthete turned hagiographer, making his
scholarly pilgrimage . . . He makes it without suspecting that it is
no more than a promenade and that everything in this world disap­
points, even sanctity . . .

The Disciple of Certain Saints
There was a time when to pronounce merely the name of a saint, a
saint who happened to be a woman, filled me with pleasure - when
I envied the chroniclers of the convents, the intimates of so many

1 33

A

ineffable hysterias, so many illuminations and pallors. I considered
that to be the secretary of such a woman, such a saint, would consti­
tute the highest career a mortal man could enj oy. And I would covet
the confessor's role among these blessed enthusiasts, and all the
details, all the secrets a Peter of Alvastra kept from us about Saint
Bridget of Sweden, Henry of Nordlingen about Mechthild of Magde­
burg, Raymond of Capua about Catherine of Siena, Brother Arnold
about Angela of Foligno, Johann of Marienwerder about Dorothea
of Montau, Clemens Brentano about Catherine Emmerich . . . It
seemed to me that a Diodata degli Ademari or a Diana of Andolo
rose up to heaven by the simple glamor of their names: they gave
me the sensual taste for another world.
When I mused on the ordeals of Rose of Lima, of Lydwina of
Schiedam, of Catherine dei Ricci, and of so many others, when I
thought of their refinement of cruelty toward themselves, of the
deliberate mortification of their charms and graces - I detested the
parasite of their pangs, the unscrupulous Bridegroom, insatiable
and celestial Don Juan who had the right of first tenant in their
hearts. Exasperated by the sighs and sweats of earthly love, I turned
to these women, if only for their pursuit of another mode of loving.
'If but one drop of what I feel,' said C atherine of Genoa, 'were to
fall into Hell, it �."Sr01..!! d f0!"th'.vith t!2.!!sfarm H ell into P:l!':ldi�e.' !
waited for that drop which, had it fallen, would have found me at
the end of its traj ectory . . .
Murmuring over the exclamations of Teresa of Avila, I heard her
crying at the age of six, 'eternity, eternity, ' then followed the devel­
opment of her deliriums, of her devotions, of her desiccations.
Nothing more captivating than the private revelations which discon­
cert the dogmas and embarrass the Church . . . I should have liked
to keep a journal of those equivocal avowals, to browse on all those
suspect nostalgias . . . It is not in a bed that the peaks of voluptuous
pleasure are to be scaled: how find in mere sublunary ecstasy what
the saints let you suspect in their ravishment, in their transports?
Bernini has shown us the quality of their secrets in his statue of the
Spanish saint in Rome, where Teresa incites us to so many consid­
erations as to the ambiguity of her swoons . . .
1 34

Sanctity and the Grimaces of the Absolute
When I think again about my debts for

an

awareness of these

extremities of passion, these darkest yet purest raptures, and that
kind of absence when the nights catch fire, when the merest blade
of grass, like the stars themselves, dissolves into a voice of tonic
intensity - instantaneous infinity, incandescent and sonorous as a
radiant and demented god might conceive it - when I think again
about all this, a single name haunts me: Teresa of Avila - and the
words of one of her revelations I used to repeat to myself daily:
<You must no longer speak with men but with angels. '
I lived for years i n the shadow o f these women, these saints, believ­
ing that no poet, sage, or madman would ever equal them. I expended,
in my fervor for them, all my powers of worship, my vitality in desire,
my ardor in dreams. And then . . . I stopped loving them.

Wisdom and Sanctity
Of all the great sufferers, the saints are best at profiting from their
sickness. Willful, unbridled natures, they exploit their own disequi­
librium with violence and skill. The Savior, their model, was an
example of ambition and audacity, a matchless conqueror: his insinu­
ating force , his power to identity himself with the soul's flaws and
insufficiencies allowed him to establish a kingdom beyond the reach
of any mere sword. Ardent with

method:

it is this ability which was

imitated by those who took him for their ideal.
But the sage, scornful of drama and display, feels quite as remote
from the saint as from the reveler, knows nothing of the histrionic
and forges for himself an equilibrium of disillusion and unconcern.
Pascal is a saint

without temperament: sickness has made him a little

more than a sage, a little less than a saint. Which accounts for his
oscillations and the skeptical shadow that follows his fervors. A

esprit in the Incurable .

From the s age's viewpoint, there can be no one more impure
than the saint; from the saint's, no one emptier than the sage . Here
we have the whole difference between the man who understands
and the man who aspires.

A Short History of Decay

Woman and the Absolute
'While Our Lord spoke to me and I contemplated his marvelous
beauty, I noticed the sweetness and at times the severity with which
his lovely and divine lips uttered the words. I desired ardently to know
the color of his eyes and the proportions of his stature, that I might
be able to speak of them: but never have I deserved to have such
knowledge. All effort to that end is of no avail. ' - Saint Teresa.

The color of his eyes .

. . Impurities of female sanctity! To carry the

indiscretion of her sex up to Heaven itself - that is of a nature to
console and compensate any man - and better still, any woman who has remained outside the divine adventure . The first man, the
first woman: that is the essence of the Fall which nothing, genius nor
sanctity, will ever redeem. Who has ever seen a new man totally supe­
rior to the one he was? ForJesus himself, the Transfiguration may have
meant only a fugitive event, a development without consequences . . .
Between Saint Teresa and other women, then, there is no more
than a difference in capacity for delirium, a question of the intensity
and direction of

caprice.

Love - human or divine - levels human

beings: to love a girl or to love Cod presupposes t.�e samc movement:
in both cases, you follow a creaturely impulse . Only the object changes;

but what interest does it offer, once it is merely a pretext for the need
to worship, once God is merely one outlet among so many others?

Spain
Each nation translates the divine attributes into process in its own
way, yet Spain's ardor remains unique; had the rest of the world
shared it, God would be exhausted, drained, and deprived of Himself.
It is in order not to vanish that he makes atheism prosper in

His

countries - out of self-defense. Fearing the flames He has inspired,
He reacts against His sons, against their frenzy which diminishes

Sanctity and the Grimaces of the AI1so!ute
Him; their love undermines His power and His authority; only
unbelief leaves Him intact; it is not doubts which erode God, but faith.
For centuries the Church has trivialized His prestige, and by making
Him accessible, is preparing for Him, thanks to theology, a death
without enigmas, a glossed, enlightened agony: overwhelmed by the
weight of prayers, how could He help being still more so by that of
explanations? He dreads Spain as He dreads Russia - and multiplies
atheists in both. Their attacks at least let Him retain the illusion
of omnipotence: still an attribute preserved! But the believers!
Dostoyevsky, EI Greco : has He ever had more feverish enemies? And
how could He keep from preferring Baudelaire to John of the Cross?
He fears those who see Him and those through whom He sees.

All sanctity is more or less Spanish: if God were a cyclops, Spain
would be His eye.

Hysteria of Eternity
I can concede a certain relish for the Cross, but to reproduce, and
daily, the stale event of Calvary - that partakes of the wondrous,
the inane, and the stupid. For after all the Savior, if we abuse his
prestige, is as tiresome as anyone else.
The saints were great perverts, the women among them magnifi­
cent voluptuaries. All of them - frenzied by a single idea - transformed
the Cross into a vice. <Depth' is the dimension of those who cannot
vary their thoughts and their appetites, and who explore a single
region of pleasure and of pain.
Attentive to the fluctuation of the moments, we cannot admit
an absolute event: Jesus cannot cut history in two, nor the raising
of the Cross break the impartial course of time. Religious thought
- a form of obsessive thought - subtracts a temporal portion from
the sum of events and invests it with all the attributes of the uncon­
ditioned. This is how the gods and their sons were possible . .

.

Life is the site of my infatuations: everything I wrest from indif­
ference I give back almost at once. This is not the saints' method:

137

A Short History of Decay
they

choose

once and for all . I live in order to leave off whatever I

love; they, in order to commit themselves to a single obj ect; I savor
eternity, they sink themselves into it.
The wonders of the earth - and a fortiori those of heaven - result
from a durable hysteria. Sanctity: e arthquake of the heart, annihila­
tion by dint of belief, culminating expression of fanatic sensibility,
transcendent deformity . . . Between the saved and the simple­
minded there is more correspondence than between the saved and
the skeptic. That is the entire distance which divides faith from
knowledge without hope from existence

without results.

Stages of Pride
Frequenting the saints' madness, you happen to forget your limits,
your chains, your burdens, and you exclaim: 'I am the soul of the world;

I color the universe with my flames. There will be no night from now
on: 1 have prepared the eternal banquet of the stars; the sun is superflu­
ous: everything shines, and the stones are lighter than angels' wings. '
Then, between frenzy and contemplation: ' I f I am not this Soul,
at least I aspire to be it. Have I not given my name to all things?
Every obj ec ! F!,0c!ai!!"!�

heaven: am I not the silence and the din of things?'
. . . and, at the lowest, the intoxication past: 'I am the grave of
sparks, the worms' mockery, a carrion importuning heaven, a carni­
val parody of the Beyond, a

ci-devant

Nothing without even the

privilege of ever having rotted. What perfection of the abyss have

I come to, that there is no space left for me to fall in?'

Heaven and Hygiene
Sanctity: supreme product of disease; when we are well, it seems
monstrous, unintelligible , and morbid to the highest degree. But let
that automatic Hamletism we call Neurosis claim its dues and the

Sanctity and the Grimaces of the Absolute
heavens take shape and constitute the context of anxiety. We protect
ourselves against sanctity by taking care of ourselves: it proceeds from
a special filth of the body and of the soul. If Christianity had proposed
hygiene instead of the Unverifiable , we should seek in vain for a
single saint in all its history; but it has championed our wounds and
our squalor, an intrinsic, phosphorescent squalor . . .
Health: decisive weapon against religion. Invent the universal
elixir: the heavens will vanish and never return. No use seducing
man by other ideals: they will be weaker than diseases. God is our
rust, the gradual decay of our substance: when He penetrates us,
we think we are elevated, but we descend lower and lower ; having
reached our end, He crowns our collapse, and so we are 'saved'
forever. Sinister superstition, haloed cancer which has eaten away
the earth for ages . . .
I hate all gods; I am not healthy enough to scorn them. That is
the Indifferent Man's great humiliation.

On Certain Solitudes
There are hearts God cannot look into without losing His innocence.
Sadness began after the Creation: had the Creator ventured further
into the world He would have compromised His equilibrium. The
man who believes he can still die has not knowp. certain solitudes,
nor the inevitability of immortality perceived in certain pangs . . .
It is our modern specialty to have localized hell in ourselves: had
we preserved its old countenance, fear, sustained by two thousand
years of threats, would have petrified us. There are no longer any
dreads which are not transposed subj ectively: psychology is our salva­
tion, our subterfuge . In the old days, this world was supposed to
emerge from one of the devil's yawns; today it is only a mistake of
the senses, a prejudice of the mind, a vice of the emotions. We know
what we can do with Saint Hildegarde's vision of the LastJudgment
or Saint Teresa's of Hell; the sublime - the Sublime of horror like
that of holiness - is classified by any treatise on mental diseases.

1 39

A Short History of Decay
And if our ills are known to us, we are not thereby exempt from
visions, but we no longer believe in them . Expert in the chemistry
of mysteries, we explain everything, even our tears. This, however,
remains inexplicable: if the soul is of such little account, where does
the feeling of our solitude come from? What space does it occupy?
And how does it suddenly replace the huge vanished reality?

Oscillation
In vain you search for your model among human beings; from those
who have gone farther than you, you have borrowed only the com­
promising and harmful aspect: from the sage, sloth; from the saint,
incoherence; from the aesthete, rancor; from the poet, profligacy and from all , disagreement with yourself, ambiguity in everyday things
and hatred for what lives simply to live . Pure, you regret filth; sordid,
seemliness; vague, vigor. You will never be anything but what you are
not, and the despair of being what you are . With what contrasts was
your substance imbued and what mingled genius presided over your
relegation in the world? Determination to diminish yourself has made
you espouse in others their appetite for collapse: in this musician, this
disease; i..1'! t�i� p !'0phe!, �'hj� defe!:t; :Ll1d i!! '.V0!!! e!! - p ce!�, !ibe!'ti!!.e �,
or saints - therr melancholy, their vitiated spirits, their corruption of
flesh and blood and dreams. Bitterness, principle of your determina­
tion, your mode of action, and understanding, is the one fixed point
in your oscillation between disgust for the world and self-pity.

Threat of Sanctity
Able to live only beyond or short of life , man is a prey to two tempta­
tions: imbecility and sanctity: sub-man and superman, never

himself.

But whereas he does not suffer from the fear of being less than what
he is, the prospect of being more terrifies him. Committed to pain, he
dreads its conclusion: how could he consent to founder in that abyss

140

Sanctity and the Grimaces of the Absolute
of perfection which is sanctity; and there lose his own control? To slide
toward imbecility or toward sanctity is to let yourself be lured outside
yourself. Yet we are not alarmed by the loss of consciousness implied
by the approach of idiocy, while the prospect of perfection is insep­
arable from vertigo. It is by imperfection that we are superior to God;
and it is the fear of losing it which makes us flee sanctity! The terror
of a future in which we shall no longer be in despair . . . in which, at
the term of our disasters, another, unlonged for, would appear - the
terror of salvation, the terror of becoming saints . . .
The man who adores his imperfections is frightened of a trans­
figuration which his sufferings might prepare for him. To vanish in
a transcendent light . . . Better then to make for the absolute of
darkness, toward the comforts of imbecility . . .

The Tilting Cross
Sublime hodgepodge, Christianity is too profound - and above all,
too impure - to last any longer: its centuries are numbered. Jesus
fades, from day to day; his precepts, like his mildness, vex; his
miracles and his divinity make us smile. The Cross tilts: the symbol
is turning back into substance . . . back into the order of that decom­
position in which, without exception, honorable and unworthy
things die. Two thousand years of success! A fabulous resignation
on the part of the most fretful animal of all . . . but our patience is
exhausted. The notion that I could - like everyone else - be sincerely
Christian, if only a second, casts me into perplexity. The Savior bores
me. I dream of a universe exempt from celestial intoxications, of a
universe with neither Cross nor faith.
Who can fail to see the moment coming when there will be no
more religion, wheri man, lucid and empty, will have no word on
hand to designate his abyss? The Unknown will be as dull as the
known; everything w ill lack interest and flavor. On the ruins of
Knowledge, a sepulchral lethargy will make us all into specters,
lunar heroes of Incuriosity . . .

A Short History of Decay

Theology
I am in a good mood: God is good; I am sullen: God is wicked; I am
indifferent: He is neutral. My states confer upon Him corresponding
attributes: when I love knowledge, He is omniscient, and when I
worship power, omnipotent. When things seem to me to exist, He
exists; when they seem illusory, He evaporates. A thousand argu­
ments sustain Him, and a thousand destroy; if my enthusiasms
animate Him, my sulks smother Him. We cannot form a more vari­
able image: we fear Him as a monster and crush him like a worm;
we idolize Him: He is Being; repel Him: He is Nothingness. Were
Prayer to supplant Gravity, it would scarcely assure His universal
duration: He would still remain at the mercy of our moments. His
fate has decided that He be unchangeable only in the eyes of the
naive or the retarded. Scrutiny reveals Him: useless cause, meaning­
less absolute, patron of dolts, pastime of solitaries, straw or specter
according to whether he amuses our mind or haunts our fevers.

I am generous: He swells with attributes ; sour : He is heavy with
absence. I have experienced Him in all His forms. He

resists neither

curiosity nor iu.spcction: I Ii:; mystery, I Ii:; i:l.tf.l.niry declines; rJ.:; luster
dims; his prestige diminishes. He is a worn costume we must strip

off; how still drape ourselves in a tattered God? His degradation,
His agony drag on through the ages; but He will not outlive us, He
is aging: His last gasps will precede ours. Once His attributes are
exhausted, no one will have the energy to forge Him new ones; and
the creature having assumed, then rej ected, them will go and rej oin,
in nothingness, his loftiest invention: his Creator.

The Metaphysical Animal
If we could eliminate everything Neurosis has inscribed in the mind
and the heart, all the morbid marks it has left there, all the impure

142

Sanctity and the Grimaces of the Absolute
shadows accompanying it! What is not superficial is unclean. God:
fruit of the anxiety of our guts and the gurgle of our ideas . . . Only
aspiration to the Void saves us from that exercise of corruption which
is the act of belief What limpidity in the Art of appearance, in the
indifference to our ends and our disasters! To think of God, to seek
Him, to invoke or to endure Him - movements of a disordered body
and a defeated mind! The nobly superficial ages - the Renaissance, the
eighteenth century - scorned religion, dismissed its rudimentary frol­
ics. But alas! There is a plebeian melancholy in us which darkens our
fervors and our concepts. Vainly we dream of a lace universe; God,
product of our depths, our gangrene, profanes this dream of beauty.
We are metaphysical animals by the corruption we harbor in
ourselves. History of thought - procession of our lapses; life of the
Mind - parade of our vertigo. When our health declines, the universe
suffers for it and must follow the descending curve of our vitality.
Endlessly harping on the 'why' and the 'how' ; tracing the Cause,
and all causes, on the slightest pretext - denotes a disorder of the
functions and faculties which ends in a 'metaphysical delirium' senility of the abyss, downfall of anguish, ultimate ugliness of the
mysteries . . .

Genesis of Melancholy
Every profound dissatisfaction is of a religious nature: our failures
derive from our incapacity to conceive of paradise and to aspire to
it, as our discomforts from the fragility of our relations with the
absolute. 'I am an incomplete religious animal, I suffer all ills doubly'
- an adage of the Fall which man keeps repeating to comfort himself.
Failing to do so, he appeals to ethics, decides to follow, at the risk
of ridicule , edifYing advice:

'Resolve

to be melancholy no longer:

ethics replies. And man strives to enter the universe of Good, of
Well-Being, of Hope . . . But his efforts are ineffectual and

Divagations in a Monastery
For the unbeliever, infatuated with waste and dispersion, there is
no spectacle more disturbing than these ruminants of the absolute
. . . Where do they find such pertinacity in the unverifiable, so much
attention in the vague, and so much ardor to apprehend it as well?
I share neither their certitudes nor their s erenity. They are happy,

and I blame them for being so. If at least they hated themselves! But
they prize their 'soul' more than the universe; this false evaluation
is the source of sacrifices and renunciations of an imposing absurd­
ity. Whereas our experiences have neither sequence nor system,
being at the mercy of chance and our moods, they have but one
experience, always the same, of a monotony and a profundity which
are profoundly disheartening. It is true that God is its object; but what
interest can they still take in Him? Always equal to Himself, infinitely

of the same nature, He never renews Himself; I could reflect upon
Him in passing, but to fill the hours with Him! . . .

attend His own celebration I would not get out of bed on a night this
cold! But in any case He

has to

exist, otherwise these sacrifices of

creatures of flesh, shaking off their sloth to worship Him, would be

of such insanity that reason could not endure the thought. The proofs
of theology are futile compared to this exertion which perplexes the
unbeliever and obliges him to attribute a m eaning and a use to such
efforts. Unless he resigns himself to an aesthetic perspective of these
deliberate insomnias, and in the vanity of these vigils sees merely the
most gigantic adventure, the quest of a Beauty of non-meaning and
dread . . . The splendor of a prayer addressed to No One! But something
has to be: when this Probable changes into certitude, felicity is no
longer a mere word, so true is it that the only answer to nothingness

144

Sanctity and the Grimaces of the Absolute
lies in illusion. How have they acquired this illusion, labeled, on the
absolute level, grace? By what privilege were they led to hope what
no hope in this world lets us glimpse? By what right do they install
themselves in an eternity which everything denies us? By what subter­
fuge do these possessors - the only

true

possessors I have ever

encountered - arrogate the mystery to themselves in order to delight
in it thereby? God belongs to them; to attempt to sneak Him away
would be futile; they themselves know nothing of the method by which
they have taken possession.

was converted by a simple appeal: he believed without being conscious

no

to it. You are a believer or you are not, the way you are crazy or

madness to which I am not at all subject . . . The unbeliever's position
is quite as impenetrable as the believer's. I devote myself to the pleas­

ure of being disappointed:

this is the very essence of the world; above

Doubt, I rank only the delight which derives from it . . .
And I answer all these pink or chlorotic monks: 'You insist to no
purpose. I too have gazed upon the heavens, but I have seen nothing
there . Give up trying to convince me: if I have sometimes been able
to find God by deduction, I have never found Him in my heart; if I
found him there, I could not follow you on your path

or

in your

grimaces, still less in those b allets which are your masses and
complines. Nothing surpasses the pleasures of idleness: if the end
of the world were to come, I would not leave my bed at an ungodly
hour, so how would I go running in the middle of the night to
immolate my sleep on the altar of the Uncertain? Even if grace
beclouded me and ecstasies made me quiver unceasingly, a few
sarcasms would b e enough to distract me. Oh no, you see, I would
be afraid to sneer in my prayers and thereby to damn myself much
more by faith than by incredulity. Spare me any further effort; in
any case, my shoulders are too weary to prop heaven . .

Exercise of Insubmission
How I detest, Lord, the turpitude of Your works and these syrupy
ghosts who burn incense to You and resemble You! Hating You, I have
escaped the sugar mills of Your Kingdom, the twaddle of Your puppets.
You are the damper of our flames and our rebellions, the fire hose of
our fevers, the superintendent of our senilities. Even before relegating
You to a formula, I trampled Your arcana, scorned Your tricks and all
those artifices which produce Your toilette of the Inexplicable. You
have generously endowed me with the gall Your pity spared Your slaves.
Since there is no rest but in the shadow of Your nullity, the brute finds
salvation by just handing himself over to You or Your counterfeits. I
don't know which is more pitiable, Your acolytes or myself: we all
derive straight from Your incompetence :

pitch, patch, hodgepodge

-

syllables of the Creation, of Your blundering . . .
Of all that was attempted this side of nothingness, is anything
more pathetic than this world, except for the idea which conceived
it? Wherever something breathes there is one more infirmity: no

moment is merely a vote in the urn of my despair.
What does it matter, whether Your works leave off or continue!
Your subalterns cannot complete what You ventured without genius.
From the blindness into which You plunged them, they will emerge
nonetheless, but will they have the strength to take revenge, and
will You to defend Yourself? This race is rusty, and You even rustier.
Turning toward Your Enemy, I await the day when he will pilfer
Your sun to hang it in another universe .

The Decor of Knowledge

Our truths are worth no more than those of our ancestors. Having
substituted concepts for their myths and symbols, we consider
ourselves ' advanced' ; but these myths and symbols expressed no less
than our concepts. The Tree of Life, the Serpent, Eve, and Paradise
signify as much as Life, Knowledge, Temptation, Unconsciousness.
The concrete figurations of good and evil in mythology go as far as
the Good and Evil of ethics. Knowledge - if it is profound - never
changes: only its decor varies. Love continues without Venus, war
without Mars, and if the gods no longer intervene in events, those
events are neither more explicable nor less disconcerting: the para­
phernalia of formulas merely replaces the pomp of the old legends,
without the constants of human life being thereby modified, science
apprehending them no more intimately than poetic narratives.
Modern complacency is limitless: we suppose ourselves more
enlightened, more profound than all the centuries behind us, forget­
ting that the teaching of a Buddha confronted thousands of beings
with the problem of nothingness, a problem we imagine we have
discovered because we have changed its terms and introduced a
touch of erudition into it. But what Western thinker would survive
a comparison with a Buddhist monk? We lose ourselves in texts and
terminologies:

meditation is a

datum unknown to modern philoso­

phy. If we want to keep some intellectual decency, enthusiasm for
civilization must be banished from our mind, as well as the supersti­
tion of History. As for the great problems, we have no advantage
over our ancestors or our more recent predecessors: men have
always known

everything,

at least in what concerns the Essential;

modern philosophy adds nothing t o Chines e , Hindu, or G reek
philosophy. Moreover, there cannot b e a

new problem,

despite our

naivete or our infatuation which would like to persuade us to the
contrary. In the play of ideas, who ever equaled a Chinese or a Greek
sophist, who was ever b older in abstraction? All the extremities of
thought were reached from the first - and in all civilizations. Seduced
by the demon of the Unpublished, we forget too quickly that we
are the epigones of the first pithecanthropus who bothered to
reflect.
Hegel is chiefly responsible for modern optimism . How could he
have failed to see that consciousness changes only its forms and
modalities, but never progresses? Becoming excludes an absolute
fulfillment, a goal: the temporal adventure unfolds without an aim
external to itself, and will end when its possibilities of movement
are exhausted. The degree of consciousness varies with the ages,
such consciousness not being aggrandized by their succession. We
are not more conscious than the Greco-Roman world, the Renais­
sance, or the eighteenth century; each period is perfect in itself - and
perishable . There are privileged moments when consciousness is
exasperated, but there was never an eclipse of lucidity such that
m :1 n W<l �

f>��f>!'l!; ,,1

r!,0ble�� , hi�!0!'}'

being no more than a perpetual crisis, even a breakdown of naivete.

Negative states - precisely those which exasperate consciousness

are

variously distributed; nonetheless they are present in every historical
period; balanced and 'happy, ' they know Ennui - the natural name
for happiness; unbalanced and tumultuous, they suffer Despair and
the religious crises which derive from it. The idea of an Earthly
Paradise was comp o s e d of all the elements incompatible with
History, with the space in which the negative states flourish.
All means and methods of knowing are valid: reasoning, intuition,
disgust, enthusiasm, lamentation. A vision of the world propped
on concepts is no more legitimate than another which proceeds
from tears, arguments, or sighs - modalities equally probing and

The Decor of Knowledge
equally vain. I construct a form of universe; I believe in it, and it is
the univers e , which collapses nonetheless under the assault of
another certitude o r another doubt. The merest illiterate and
Aristotle are equally irrefutable - and fragile. The absolute and
decrepitude characterize the work ripened for years and the poem
dashed off in a moment. Is there more truth in

The Phenomenology

of Mind than in Epipsychidion? Lightninglike inspiration,

as well as

laborious investigation, offers us definitive results - and ridiculous
ones. Today I prefer this writer to that one; tomorrow will come
the turn of a work I detested quite recently. The creations of the
mind - and the principles which preside over them - follow the fate
of our moods, of our age, of our fevers, and our disappointments.
We call into question everything we once loved, and are always right
and always wrong; for everything is valid - and nothing has any
importance. I smile: a world is born; I frown: it vanishes, and another
appears. No opinion, no system, no belief fails to be correct and at
the same time absurd, depending on whether we adhere to it or
detach ourselves from it.
We do not find more rigor in philosophy than in poetry, nor in
the mind than in the heart; rigor exists only so long as we identify
ourself with the principle or thing which we confront or endure;
from outside, everything is arbitrary: reasons and sentiments. What
we call truth is an error insufficiently experienced, not yet drained,
but which will soon age, a new error, and which waits to com­
promise its novelty. Knowledge blooms and withers along with our
feelings. And if we are in a position to scrutinize all truths, it is
because we have been exhausted together - and because there is no
more sap in us than in them. History is inconceivable outside of

what disappoints. Which accounts for the desire to submit ourselves
to melancholy, and to die of it . . .
True knowledge comes down to vigils in the darkness: the sum of
our insomnias alone distinguishes us from the animals and from our
kind. What rich or strange idea was ever the work of a sleeper? Is
your sleep sound? Are your dreams sweet? You swell the anonymous

I5I

A Short History of Decay
crowd. Daylight is hostile to thoughts, the sun blocks them out; they
flourish only in the middle of the night . . . C onclusion of nocturnal
knowledge: every man who arrives at a reassuring conclusion about
anything at all gives evidence of imbecility or false charity. who
ever found a single j oyous truth which was valid? Who saved the
honor of the intellect with daylight utterances? Happy the man who
can say to himself: 'Knowledge turned sour on me . '
History i s irony o n the move, the Mind's jeer down through men and
events. Today this belief triumphs; tomorrow, vanquished, it will
be dismissed and replaced: those who accepted it will follow it in its
defeat. Then comes another generation: the old belief is revived; its
demolished monuments are reconstructed . . . until they perish yet
again. No immutable principle rules the favors and severities of fate :
their succession participates in the huge farce of the Mind, which
identifies, in its play, impostors and enthusiasts, ardors and devices.
Consider the polemics of each age: they seem neither motivated
nor necessary. Yet they were the very life of that age . Calvinism,
Quietism, Port-Royal, the

Encyclopedia, the Revolution,
had to

etc . . . what a series of absurdities . . . which

Positivism ,
be, what a

futile and yet fatal expense! From the ecu menical councils to the
("()ntrovpr�ip � ()f ("nntPm p nr"ry p nlitico:: , nrthnelnvipo:: :>nel h"r,,�i,,�
have assailed the curiosity of mankind with their irresistible non­
meaning. Under various disguises there will always b e pro and

con,

whether apropos of Heaven or the B ordello. Thousands of men
will suffer for subtleties relating to the Virgin and the Son; thousands
of others will torment themselves for dogmas less gratuitous but
quite as improbable. All truths constitute sects which end by endur­
ing the destiny of a Port-Royal, by being persecuted and destroyed;
then, their ruins, beloved now and embellished with the halo of the
iniquity inflicted upon them, will be transformed into a pilgrimage­
site . . .
It is no less unreasonable to grant more interest to the arguments
around democracy and its forms than to those which took place, in
the Middle Ages, around nominalism and realism: each period is

1 52

The Decor of Knowledge
intoxicated by an absolute, minor and tiresome but in app earance
uniqu e ; we cannot avoid being contemporaries of a faith, of a
system, of an ideology, cannot avoid being, in short, of our time.
In order to be emancipated from that, we would require the coldness
of a god

of scorn . . .

That History has no meaning is what should delight our hearts.
Should we be tormenting ourselves for a happy solution to process,
for a final festival paid for by nothing but our sweat, our disasters?
For future idiots exulting over our labors, frolicking on our ashes?
The vision of a paradisiac conclusion transcends, in its absurdity,
the worst divagations of hope. All we can offer in excuse for Time
is that in it we find some moments more profitable than others,
accidents without consequence in an intolerable monotony of
perplexities. The universe b egins and ends with each individual,
whether he be Shakespeare or Hodge; for each individual experi­
ences his merit or his nullity

in the absolute . . .

By what artifice did what seems to b e escape the control of what is
not? A moment of inattention, of weakness at the heart of Nothing­
ness: the grubs took advantage of it; a gap in its vigilance: and here
we are. And just as life supplanted nothingness, life in its turn was
supplanted by history: existence thereby committed itself to a cycle
of heresies which sapped the orthodoxy of the void.

The Rope
I no longer remember how I happened to become the recipient of
this confidence: 'Possessing not property, projects, or even mem­
ories, I have given over future and philosophy alike, owning merely
a cot on which to unlearn the sun and sighs. I remain stretched out
there, and spin out the hours; around me, utensils, objects which
suggest suicide, every one. The nail whispers: stick me through your
heart, the trickle of blood need not alarm you . The knife insinuates:
my blade is infallible; one second's decision and you have triumphed
over misery and shame . The window opens of its own accord,
creaking in the silence: you share the city's heights with the poor;
fl ing yourself out, my overture is a generous one; in the wink of an
eye, you will land on the pavement with the meaning - or the mean­
inglessness - of life in your grasp. And a rope coils as though around
some ideal neck, borrowing the tone of a suppliant power: I have
been waiting for you forever, I have watched your terrors, your
struggles, and your rages, I have seen your rumpled sheets, the
pillow where your fury gnawed, as I have heard the swearwords
with which you gratified the gods. Charitable, I sympathize and
o ffer my services . For you were born to hang yourself, like all
those who disdain an answer to their doubts or an escape to their
despair. '

Underside of an Obsession
The notion of nothingness is not characteristic of laboring human­
ity: thos e who toil have neither time nor inclination to weigh their
dust; they resign themselves to the difficulties or the doltishness of
fate; they hop e : hope is a slave's virtue.
It is the vain, the fatuous, and the coquettish who, dreading gray
hair, wrinkles and the death rattle, fill their daily vacancy with the

1 57

A Short History of Decay

image of their own carrion: they cherish and despair of themselves;
their thoughts flutter between the mirror and the graveyard, and
discover in the jeopardized features of their faces truths as serious
as those of religion. Every metaphysic begins with an anguish of
the body, which then becomes universal; so that those obsessed by
frivolity prefigure authentically tormented minds. The superficial
idler, haunted by the specter of age, is closer to Pascal, Bossuet, or
Chateaubriand than a savant quite unconcerned with himself. A
touch of genius in vanity: you have the great proud man who finds
death hard to deal with - who takes it as a personal offinse. Buddha
himself, superior to all the sages, was merely fatuous on a divine
scale. He discovered death, his death, and, wounded, renounced
everything and imposed his renunciation on others. Thus the most
terrible and the most futile sufferings are begotten by that crushed
pride which, in order to face up to Nothingness, transforms it, out
of revenge, into Law.

Epitaph

'He had the pride never to command or to prescribe anything,
anvone. Without suhalterns. with ou t m ;] �tf'r� . h I" n f'ithf'r U::lVP nor
received orders. Excluded from the empire of laws and somehow
anterior to good and evil, he never made a living soul suffer. The
names of things faded from his memory; he looked without seeing,
listened without hearing; scents and savors vanished at the approach
of his nostrils, his palate. His senses and his desires were his only
slaves: hence they felt, desired nothing. He forgot happiness and
misery, thirst and fear; and if he happened to recall them, he scorned
to name them and thereby to sink to hope or regret. The merest
gesture cost him more efforts than it would cost others to establish
or overthrow a kingdom. Born weary of being born, he chose to
be a shade; when, then, did he live, and by the transgression of what
birth? And if, living, he wore his shroud, by what miracle did he

Secularization of Tears
Only since Beethoven has music addressed itself to men: before him,
it was concerned only with God. Bach and the great Italians knew
nothing of this descent toward the human, this false titanism which
has diluted, since the Deaf Man, the purest art.T he torsion of the
will replaced the suavities; the contradiction of the feelings, the
naive flight; frenzy, the disciplined sigh: heaven having vanished from
music, man was installed there.Where sin had once spread in gentle
tears, it now displayed itself so that declamation overtook prayer,
and the romanticism of the Fall triumphed over the harmonious
dream of deposition ...
Bach: languor of cosmogony; a scale of tears upon which our
desires for God ascend; architecture of our fragilities, positive dissol­
ution - the highest of all - of our will; celestial ruin in Hope; the
one mode of destroying ourselves without disaster, and of disap­
pearing without dying ...
Is it too late to relearn such dying out? Or must we go on falter­
ing without benefit of the organ's chords?

Fluctuations of the Will
'Do you know that furnace of the will in which nothing resists your
desires, where fatality and gravitation lose their empire and vanish
before the magic of your power? Certain that your gaze would revive
the dead, that your hand laid upon matter would bring it to life, that
stones would shudder at your touch, that every graveyard would
blossom in a smile of immortality - you tell yourself: "From now
on there will be nothing but an eternal spring, a dance of wonders,
and the end of all sleep.I have brought another fire: the gods pale
and the creatures rejoice; consternation has seized upon the vaults,
and the din has descended into the very tombs. '

'.. . and the amateur of paroxysms, winded, falls silent only to
resume, with the accent of quietism, words of abandon:
"'Have you ever experienced that somnolence which is transmit­
ted to things, that slackness which weakens the sap and suggests a
triumphant - and eternal - autumn? Even as I pass all hopes drowse,
flowers fade, the instincts wither : everything stops willing, every­
thing repents of having willed. And each being whispers to me: 'Let
someone else have lived my life, God or garter snake. I sigh for a
will to inaction, an unreleased infinity, an ecstatic atony of the
elements, a hibernation in broad daylight, which would benumb
everything, from hog to dragonfly . . . '

Theor y of Goodness
'Since for you there is no ultimate criterion nor irrevocable prin­
ciple, and no god, what keeps you from committing any and every

presupposes a constant vigilance and a systematic mind, a costly
continuity, whereas the indifference of forgiveness and contempt
renders the hours pleasantly empty. All ethics represent a danger
for goodness; only negligence rescues it. Having chosen the phlegm
of the imbecile and the apathy of the angel, I have excluded myself
from actions and, since goodness is incompatible with life, I have
decomposed myself in order to be good:

Making Allowances
It requires a considerable amount of unconsciousness to devote
oneself unreservedly to anything. Believers, lovers, diSCiples perceive

160

Abdications
only one face of their deities, their idols, their masters. The worship­
per remains ineluctably naIve . Is there a pure feeling which fails to
betray the mixture of grace and imbecility, a blissful a dmiration
without an e clipse of the intelligence? The man who glimpses
simultaneously all the aspects of a being or a thing remains forever
undecided between impulse and stupor. Dissect any belief: what
pomp of the heart - and how much turpitude underneath! Infinity
dreamed of in the gutter retains, ineffaceable, its imprint, its stench.
There is a notary in every s aint, a grocer in every hero, a concierge
inside the martyr. The depth of sighs conceals a grimace; sacrifices
and devotions are mingled with the vapors of the earthly bordello.
Consider love : is there a nobler outpouring, a rapture less suspe ct?
Its shudders rival music, compete with the tears of solitude and of
ecstasy: sublime, but a sublimity inseparable from the urinary tract:
transports bordering upon excretion, a heaven of the glands, sudden
sanctity of the orifices . . . It takes no more than

attention

a

moment of

for this intoxication, shaken, to cast you back into the

ordures of physiology, or a moment of fatigue to recognize that
so much ardor produces only a variety of mucous. The waking
state in our ravishments alters their fl avor and transforms their
victim into a visionary trampling ineffable pretexts. We cannot love
and know at the same time , without love suffering and expiring
under the mind's gaz e . S earch your admirations, scrutinize the
beneficiaries of your worship and the profiteers of your abandons :
under their most disinterested thoughts you will discover self-love,
the spur of fame, the thirst for domination and power. All thinkers
are action's eunuchs who take revenge for their failure by the inter­
mediary of concepts. Born

this side of the deed, they exalt or d ecry

it, depending on whether they aspire to humanity'S gratitude or
that other form of fame: its hatred; they unduly erect their own
deficiencies, their own miseries to the rank of laws, their futility
to the level of a principle . Thought is as much of a lie as love or
faith. For the truths are frauds and the passions odors; and ultim­
ately there is no choice except the one between what lies and what
stinks.

161

A Short History of Decay

Wonders of Vice
Whereas a thinker requires - to dissociate himself from the world
- an enormous labor of interrogations, the privilege of a flaw confers
from the start a singular destiny. Vice - bestower of solitude - offers
the man marked out by it the excellence of a separate condition.
Consider the invert: he inspires two contradictory sentiments: disgust
and admiration; his 'failure' makes him at once inferior and superior
to the others; he does not accept himself, constantly justifies himself,
invents reasons, torn between shame and pride; yet - enthusiasts of
the fatuities of procreation - we go with the herd. Woe to those who
have no sexual secrets! How could we divine the fetid advantages of
the aberrations? Shall we remain forever the progeniture of nature,
victims of her laws, nothing but human trees?
The individual's deficiencies determine a civilization's flexibility
and subtlety. Rare sensations are conducive to the mind and its vital­
ity: the distracted instinct is located at the antipodes of b arbarism.
Consequently an impotent man is more complex than a brute with
undisturbed reflexes, and realizes better than anyone the essence of
inadequacies, all its impossibilities. Suppress vices and flaws, take
away carnal disorders, and you will meet no more souls; for what we
call by that name is merely a product of inner scandals, a designation
of mysterious shames , an idealization of abjection . . .
In the depths of his naiVete the thinker envies the possibilities of
knowledge open to whatever is

contra naturam;

he believes - not

without repulsion - in the privileges of 'monsters' . . . Vice being a
suffering and the sole form of celebrity worth the trouble, the 'vicious'
man has

to be deeper than the common run, since unspeakably separ­

ated from the rest; he begins where the others leave off . . .
A natural pleasure , taken in what is obvious, cancels itself out,

destroys itself in its own means, expires in its actuality, whereas an
unwonted sensation is a

r62

thought out

sensation, a reflection in the

Abdications
reflexes. Vice attains the highest degree of

consciousness

-

without

the intermediary of philosophy ; but the thinker requires a whole
lifetime to arrive at this affective lUcidity by which the pervert begins.
Yet they resemble one another in their propensity to wrest them­
selves from the others, though the one strives to do so by meditation
while the other merely follows the wonders of his inclination.

The Corrupter
'Where have the hours gone? The memory of a gesture, the mark
of a passion, the luster of a risk, a lovely, fugitive madness - nothing
of all that in your past; no delirium b ears your name, no vice honors
you. You have slipped through without a trace; but what was your
dream, then?
'I should have liked to sow Doubt into the entrails of the globe,
to imbue its substance with Doubt, to enthrone Doubt where the
mind never penetrated, and before reaching the marrow of mankind,
to shake the calm of stones, to introduce there the insecurity and
the anguish of the heart. Architect, I would have built a temple to
Ruin; preacher, revealed the farce of prayer; king, hoisted the flag
of rebellion. As men cherish a secret craving to repudiate themselves,
I should have provoked self-betrayal everywhere, plunged innocence
into stupor, multiplied disloyalties, kept the multitude from wallow­
ing in the compost heap of certitudes.'

The Architect of the Caves
Theology, ethics, history, and everyday experience teach us that to
achieve equilibrium there is not an infinity of secrets; there is only
one:

submit.

'Accept a yoke , ' these diSCiplines all repeat, 'and you will

be happy; be

something and you

shall be released from your labors. '

Indeed, all i s task here on earth: professionals o f time, functionaries
of respiration, dignitaries of hope, a job is waiting for us b e fore we

r63

A Short History of Decay
are born: our careers are prepared in the wombs of our mothers.
Members of an official universe, we have to occupy a place there,
by the mechanism of a rigid fate, which is left vacant only in favor

of the mad; they, at least, are not constrained to have a belief, to
adhere to an institution, to sustain an idea, to pursue an undertak­
ing. Since society was constituted, those who sought to withdraw
from it were persecuted or mocked. You are forgiven everything,
provided you have a trade , a subtitle to your name, a seal on your
nothingness. No one has the audacity to exclaim: 'I don't want to
do anything! ' - we are more indulgent with a murderer than with
a

mind emancipated from actions. To multiply the possibilities of

submission, to abdicate his freedom, to kill the vagabond in himself
- thus has man refined his slavery and enfeoffed himself to phan­
toms. Even his scorns and his rebellions have been cultivated only
so he can be dominated by them, serf that he is of his attitudes, his
gestures, and his moods. Having left the caves, he has kept their
superstition; he was their prisoner, and has become their architect.
He perpetuates his primal condition with more invention and more
subtlety, but at bottom, dilating o r diminishing his caricature, he
plagiarizes himself brazenly enough. A charlatan short of tricks, his
contortions, his grimaces still deceive . . .

Discipline of Atony
Like wax in the sun, I diss olve by day and s olidify at night, an alter­
nation which decomposes me and restores me to myself, a
metamorphosis in inertia and sloth . . . Was it here that all I have
read and learned was to end, was this the goal of my vigils? Idleness
has blunted my enthusiasms, slackened my appetites, enervated
my fury The man who fails to let himself go seems to me a monster:
I use up my strength in the apprenticeship to abandon, and train
myself in leisure , confronting my whims with the paragraphs of
an Art of Putrescenc e .
Everywhere people who wiU . . . masquerade of steps hurrying

Abdications
toward mean or mysterious goals; conflicting wills ; everyone wills; the
mob wills ; thousands bent on something, anything . . . I cannot follow,
still less defY them; I stop, stupefied: what marvel inspired them with
such energy? Hallucinating mobility: in so little flesh, so much vigor
and hysteria! These bacteria that no scruple can calm, that no wisdom
can soothe, that no gall can disconcert . . . They brave dangers with
more aplomb than any hero: unconscious apostles of the effective,
these saints of the Immediate . . . gods in the carnivals of time . . .
I turn away, and step off the sidewalks of the world . . . Yet there
was a time when I admired the conquerors and the bees, when I
very nearly hoped; but now, movement maddens me, and energy
merely grieves. There is more wisdom in letting yourself be carried
by the waves than in struggling against them. Posthumous to myself,
I remember Time as a kind of child's play or a lapse of taste. With­
out desires, without the hours in which to make them bloom, I have
only the assurance of having always outlived myself, a fetus devoured
by an omniscient idiocy even before his eyelids opened, and stillborn
of lucidity . . .

Supreme Erosion
There is something which rivals the most sordid troll, something
dirty, worn, defeated, and which provokes and at the same time
disconcerts fury - a p e ak of exasperation and an article of every
moment: the
use of.

word, any word, and more precisely the one we make
I say: tree, house, me, magnificent, stupid; I could say anything,

and I dream of a murderer of all nouns and all adjectives, of all these
honorable eructations. Sometimes it seems to me they are dead and
no one wants to bury them. Out of cowardice, we still consider
them to be alive and go on enduring their smell without holding
our noses. Yet they are not, no longer express, anything. When we
think of all the mouths they pass through, all the breaths they
corrupt, all the occasions on which they were offered, can we still
employ a single one without being polluted?

A Short History of Decay

They are tossed to us pre-chewed: yet we would not dream of
swallowing food already masticated by others : the material action
which corresponds to the use of words turns our stomach; yet all
it takes is a moment's irritation to realize, under any word, an after­
taste of someone else's saliva.
To refresh language , humanity would have to stop talking: it
would resort profitably to signs , or more effectively, to silence.
Prostitution of the word is the most visible symptom of its degrad­
ation; there is no utterance intact, no pure articulation, and down
to the very things signified, everything is corrupted by repetitions.
Why would each generation not learn a new idiom, if only to give
a new vigor to objects? How love and hate , struggle and suffer
with these anemic symbols? 'Life: 'death' - metaphysical stereo­
types, exhausted enigmas . . . Man should create another illusion of
reality and invent to this end other words, since his own lack blood
and, at their stage of agony, there is no transfusion possible .

ill . . . this oppression under the weight of a thousand oceans, this
desire for an ideally baleful poison . . .
The vulgarities of renewal, the provocations of the sun, of foli­
age, of sap . . . My blood disintegrates when the buds open, when
the bird and the beast frolic . . . I envy the mad, the sleeping
dormouse, the bear's winters, the sage's dryness; I would exchange
for their torpor my agitation, the frenzy of a vague murderer who
dreams of crimes this side of blood. And more than them all, how
much I envy those emperors of the decadence, sullen and cruel,
who were stabbed at the height of their criminal course!
I give myself up to space like a blind man's tears. Whose will am
I, who wills in me? I wish some demon would conceive a conspiracy
against man: I would j oin it. Tired of participating in the obsequies

166

Abdications
of my desires, I should at last have an ideal excuse, for Ennui is the
martyrdom of those who live and die for no belief.

Irrefutable Disappointment
Everything confirms it, feeds it; it crowns - knowing, unimpeach­
able - events, feelings, thoughts; no moment which fails to consecrate
it, no impulse which fails to empower it, no reflection which fails
to reinforce it. Divinity, whose kingdom is limitless, more powerful
than the fatality which serves and illustrates it, hyphen between life
and death, it unites, identifies, and feeds on them both. Beside its
arguments and verifications, the sciences themselves seem a jumble
of whims. Nothing can diminish the fervor of its distastes: what
truths, flourishing in a spring of axioms, could defy its visionary
dogmatism, its proud insanity? No heat of youth nor even the mind's
derangement resists its certitudes, and its victories are proclaimed
with one and the same voice by wisdom and by madness. Before its
seamless empire, before its limitless sovereignty, our knees bend:
everything begins in ignorance of it, everything ends by yielding to
it; no action evades it, none fails to be led back to it. The

last word

here on e arth, it alone does not disappoint . . .

In the Secret of Moralists
When we have stuffed the universe with melancholy, all we have left
to light up the mind with is joy, impossible, rare, flashing j oy; and it
is when we no longer hope that we suffer the fascination of hope .
Life - a gift given to the living by those obsessed with death . . . Since
the direction of our thoughts is not that of our hearts, we sustain a
secret inclination for all that we trample down. Say a man registers
the creaking of the world's machinery: it is because he has dreamed
too much of the resonance of the Spheres; failing to hear them, he
abases himself to hear only the din around him. Bitter words emanate

A Short History of Decay
from a wounded sensibility, from an offended delicacy. The venom
of a La Rochefoucauld, a Chamfort, was the revenge they took on
a world designed for brutes . All gall conceals a revenge and is trans­
lated into a system : pessimism - that

cruelty of the conquered

who

cannot forgive life for having deceived their expectations.
The gaiety which strikes mortal blows . . . the pleasantry which
conceals the dagger under a smile . . . I think of certain ironies of
Voltaire, certain retorts of Rivarol, the stinging words of Mme du
Deffand, the jeers which show through so much elegance, the aggres­
sive frivolity of the salons, the sallies which entertain and slaughter,
the bitterness contained in an excess of civility . . . And I think of an

ideal moralist - a combination

of cynicism and lyric ardor - exalted

and icy, vague and incisive, as close to Rousseau's Reveries as to Laclos'

Liaisons,

or uniting in himself Vauvenargues and Sade, tact and

torment . . . Observer of

mores

in

himself,

having no need to seek

elsewhere, the least attention on home grounds would show him
the contradictions of life, all of whose aspects he would reflect so
well that, ashamed of duplication, it would disappear . . .

from it for the observer, from the classical moralist down to Proust.
Everything dissolves under the searching eye: passions, long attach­
ments, ardors are the characteristic of simple minds, faithful to others
and to themselves. A touch of lucidity in the 'heart' makes it the seat
of feigned feelings and turns the lover into Adolphe and the discontent
into Rene . Loving, we do not examine love; acting, we do not medi­
tate upon action; if I study my 'neighbor' it is because he has ceased
to be my neighbor, and I am no longer 'myself' if I analyze myself: I
become an object along with all the rest. The b eliever who weighs his
faith ends by putting God in the scales, and safeguards his fervor only
out of fear of losing it. Placed at the antipodes of naivete, of integral
and authentic existence, the m oralist exhausts himself in a vis-i-vis
with himself and with others: comedian, microcosm of second

thoughts, he does not endure the artifice which men, in order to live ,

spontaneously accept and incorporate in their nature. Everything seems
convention: he divulges the motives of feelings and actions, he
unmasks the simulacra of civilization, because he suffers at having
glimpsed and gone beyond them; for these simulacra give life , they

are life, whereas his existence, in contemplating them, strays into the
search for a 'nature' which does not exist and which,

if it did, would

be as alien to him as the artifices which have been added to it. All
psychological complexity reduced to its elements, explained and
dissected, involves an operation much deadlier to the operator than
to the victim. We liquidate our feelings by pursuing their detours, and
our impulses if we ambush their trajectory; and when we detail the
movements of others, it is not they who lose their way . . . Everything
we do not participate in seems unreasonable; but those who move
cannot fail to advance, whereas the observer, whichever way he turns,
registers their futile triumph only to excuse his own defeat. This is
because there is life only in the inattention to life.

Monastic Fantasy
Those days when women took the veil to conceal from the world,
and as

if from themselves, the advances of age, the diminution of

their beauty, the fading of their charms . . . when men, weary of fame
and ceremony; left the Court to take refuge in devotion . . . The fash­
ion of conversion for discretion's sake vanished with the seventeenth
century: Pascal's shadow and Jacqueline's shade fell, like invisible
glamors, over the merest courtesan, over the most frivolous beauty.
But Port-Royal has been destroyed forever, and with it, the places
favorable to discreet and solitary agonies. No more coquetry of the
convent: where now to look, in order to soften our degradations, for
a context at once dim and sumptuous? An Epicurean

like Saint­

Evremond imagined one to his liking, and as comforting and lax as his
own savoir-vivre. In those days, one still had to take God into account,
adj ust Him to disbelief, include Him in solitude.

crammed with charm, irremediably vanished! We lack cloisters as
dispossessed, as vacant as our souls, in order to lose ourselves there
without the attendance of the heavens, and in a purity of absent ideals,
cloisters befitting the disabused angels who, in their fall, by dint of
vanquished illusions, would remain still immaculate. We long for a
vogue of retreats in an eternity without faith, an assumption of the
habit in nothingness, an Order released from mysteries, and from
which no 'brother' would claim anything, disdaining his salvation
even as that of others, an Order of Impossible Salvation

delirium; subject to its distractions, we no longer meet our affiictions:

in a salutary darkness. When we curse that itch called life , and when

we are weary of the scabs of duration, the lunatic's assurance amid
his tribulations becomes a temptation and a model: let some kind
fate rid us of our reason! No escape so long as the intellect remains
attentive to the heart's impulses, so long as it does not break the
habit! I aspire to the idiot's nights, to his mineral sufferings, to the
bliss of groaning with indifference as if they were someone else's
groans, to the calvary in which we are strangers to ourselves, in which
our

own

cries come from elsewhere, to an anonymous hell where

we dance and jeer as we destroy ourselves. To live and die in the third
person . . . to be exiled in myself, to dissociate myself from my name,
forever distracted from the man I was . . . to attain at last - since life
is endurable only at this price - the wisdom of dementia . . .

My Heroes
When we are young we look for heroes. I have had mine: Kleist,
Karoline von Giinderode, Nerval, Otto Weininger . . . Intoxicated by
their suicides, I was certain that they alone had gone to the end, that
they drew, in death, the right conclusion from their thwarted or
fulfilled loves , from their broken minds or philosophic pain. lbat a
man should survive his passion was enough to make him contempt­
ible or abj ect in my eyes : which is to say that humanity was
superfluous. I discovered in it an infinitesimal number of lofty resolu­
tions and so much compromise with life that I turned away from it,
determined to put an end to it all before I was thirty: But as the years
went by, I lost the pride of youth: each day, like a lesson in humility,
I reminded myself that I was still alive, that I was betraying my dreams
among men rotten with . . . life . Exasperated by the expectation of
no longer existing, I considered it a duty to cleave my flesh when dawn
broke after a night of love, and that it was a nameless degradation to
sully by memory an excess of sighs. Or, at other moments, how was
one to insult duration further, when one had grasped everything in
a dilation which enthrones pride in the very heavens? I thought that
the only action a man could perform without shame was to take his
life, that he had no right to diminish himself in the succession of days
and the inertia of misery. No elect, I kept telling myself, but those
who committed suicide. Even now, I have more esteem for a concierge
who hangs himself than for a living poet. Man is provisionally exempt
from suicide: that is his one glory, his one excuse. But he is not aware
of it, and calls cowardice the courage of those who dared to raise
themselves by death above themselves. We are bound together by a
tacit pact to go on to the last breath: this pact which cements our
solidarity dooms us nonetheless - our entire race is stricken by its
infamy. Without suicide, no salvation. Strange! That death, though
eternal, has not become part of our behavior' :
become a vogue. Thus,

sole reality, it cannot

The Simple-Minded
Consider the accent with which a man utters the word <truth: the
inflection of assurance or reserve he uses, the expression of believing
or doubting it, and you will be edified as to the nature of his opinions
and the quality of his mind. No word is emptier; yet men make an
idol of it and convert its non-meaning at once into a criterion and a
goal of thought. This superstition - which excuses the vulgarian and
disqualifies the philosopher - results from the encroachment of hope
upon logic. You are told over and over: truth is inaccesible; yet it must

be searched for, aspired to, fought over. Behold a restriction which
fails to separate you from those who declare they have found it:

main thing is to believe it is possible:

the

to possess truth or to aspire to it

are two actions which proceed from one and the same attitude . We
make an exception of one word as of another: terrible usurpation
of language! I call simple-minded any man who speaks of Truth with

conviction: it is because he has capital letters in reserve

and employs

them naively. without deception, without disdain. As for the philos­
opher, his slightest indulgence in this idolatry exposes him: the citizen
in him has -v'V-0ii uUL 0-v-Ci- ci-.lC

3ulitiiiy. I Ivpc ('ii1�ii:,�ilb [l ULU d illu u�11i.

- that saddens us, or makes us smile . . . There is an indecency about
putting too much soul in such words: the childishness of any enthu­
siasm for knowledge . . . And it is time that philosophy. casting
discredit upon Truth, freed itself from all capital letters.

Poverty: Mental Stimulant
To keep the mind vigilant, there is only coffe e , disease, insomnia, or
the obsession of death; poverty contributes to this condition in equal
measure, if not more effectively: terror of tomorrow as much as that
of eternity, money troubles, as much as metaphYSical fears, exclude
repose and oblivion.

172

All our humiliations come from the fact that we

Abdications

cannot bring ourselves to die of hunger. We pay dearly for this cowardice.
To be dependent on men, without the vocation of beggars! To abase
ourselves before these dressed-up, lucky, infatuated marmosets! To
be at the mercy of these caricatures unworthy of contempt! It is the
shame of seeking anything which excites the desire to annihilate this
planet, with its hierarchies and the degradations they involve. Society
is not a disease, it is a disaster: what a stupid miracle that one can live
in it! When we contemplate it, between rage and indifference, it
becomes inexplicable that no one has been able to demolish its
structure, that hitherto there have not been minds desperate and
decent enough to raze it to the ground without a trace.
There is more than one resemblance between begging for a coin
in the city and waiting for an answer from the silence of the universe.
Avarice presides over men's hearts and over matter. Away with this
stingy existence ! It hoards money and mysteries : purses are a s
inaccessible as the depths of the Unknown. But - maybe someday
that Unknown will reveal itself and open its treasuries; never, so
long as there is blood in his veins, will the Rich Man unearth his
wealth . . . He will confess his shames, his vices, his crimes: he will
lie about his fortune; he will make you every confidence, hand you
his life : you will not share his last secret, his pecuniary secret . . .
Poverty is not a transitory state : it coincides with the certainty
that, whatever happens, you will never have anything, that you are
born on the wrong side of the circuit of goods, that you must strug­
gle for even a breath, and conquer air itself, and hope, and sleep,
and that even when society disappears, nature will be no less inclem­
ent, no less p erverted. No p aternal principle watched over the
Creation; everywhere , buried treasures; behold the Miser as demi­
urge, the God on high a sly skinflint. It is He who implanted in you
the terror of tomorrow: it is scarcely surprising that religion itself
should be a form of this terror.
For the paupers of eternity, poverty is a kind of stimulant they
have taken once and for all, without the possibility of an antidote ,
or a kind of innate awareness which, before any knowledge of life ,
could describe its inferno . . .

A Short History of Decay

Invocation to Insomnia
I was seventeen, and I believed in prulosophy. What did not relate to
philosophy seemed to me either a sin or slops: poets? jugglers good
for the amusement of trivial women; action? imbecility in delirium;
love, death? low excuses rej ecting the honor of concepts. Foul odors
of a universe unworthy of the mind's perfume . . . The concrete, what
an

abomination! Delight or suffering, what shames! Only abstraction

seemed to palpitate with life : I gave myself up to ancillary exploits
lest some nobler object might make me infringe my principles and
submit to the degradations of the heart. I told myself over and over:
only the brothel is compatible with metaphysics; and I coveted - to
escape poetry - the eyes of housemaids, the sighs of whores .
. . . when you came , Insomnia, to shake my flesh and my pride ,
you who transform the childish brute, give nuance to the instincts,
focus to dreams, you who in a single night grant more knowledge
than days spent in repose, and, to reddened eyelids , reveal yourself
a more important event than the nameless diseases or the disasters
of time! You made me hear the snore of health, human beings

phmgt'd

into �on ornll � oblivion, while my

solitude e!!g!"0��ed the

surrounding dark and became huger than the night. Everything
slept, slept forever. There was no dawn: I shall lie awake this way

until the end of time: they will wait for me then to ask me to account
for the blank space of my dreams . . . Each night was like the others,
each night was eternal. And I felt one with all those who cannot
sleep, with all those unknown brothers. Like the corrupt and the
fanatical, I had a secret; like them I belonged to a clan to which
everything could be excused, given, sacrificed: the clan of the sleep­
less. I granted genius to the first-comer whose eyelids were heavy
with fatigue, and admired no mind that could sleep, were it the glory
of the State, of Art or of Letters. I would have worshipped a tyrant
who - to take revenge on his nights - would have forbidden rest,
punished oblivion, prescribed disaster and fevers.

174

Abdications
And it was then that I appealed to philosophy; but there is n o
idea which comforts i n the dark, n o system which resists those vigils.
The analyse s of insomnia undo all certainties . Weary of such
destruction, I came to the point of telling myself: no more vacilla­
tion, sleep or die . . . reconquer sleep or disappear . . .
But this reconquest is no easy matter: when you come close to it,
you realize how deeply you have been marked by the nights. You love?
. . . your impulses will be forever corrupted; you will emerge from
each 'ecstasy' like a scarecrow of pleasure; you will confront the
glances of your too immediate companion with a criminal counten­
ance; you will answer her sincere gestures with the irritations of

an

envenomed pleasure; her innocence with a guilty poetry, for every­
thing for you will become poetry, but a poetry of transgression . . .
Crystalline ideas, happy sequence of thoughts? You will not think any
more: it will be an explosion, a lava of concepts, without consequence
and without order, a vomit of aggressive concepts spewed from your
guts, punishments the flesh inflicts upon itself, the mind being a victim
of the humors and out of the question . . . You will suffer from every­
thing, and to excess: the winds will seem gales; every touch a dagger ;
smiles, slaps; trifles, cataclysms. Waking may come t o an end, but its
light survives within you; one does not see in the dark with impunity,
one does not gather its lessons without danger; there are eyes which
can no longer learn anything from the sun, and souls afflicted by
nights from which they will never recover . . .

Profile of the Wicked Man
What is responsible for his not having done more evil than he might
or must, for his not c ommitting murder, wreaking subtler ven­
geances, for not having obeyed the injunctions of the blood rushing
to his head? His moods, his education? Certainly not, and still less a
native goodness; but merely the presence of the idea of death.
Inclined to forgive no one anything, he pardons all; the slightest insult
arouses his instincts; he forgets it the next moment. Enough for him

I 75

A Short History of Decay
to imagine his own corpse and to apply this method to others in
order to be suddenly soothed; the figure of what decomposes makes
him good - and cowardly: no wisdom (nor charity) without macabre
obsessions. The healthy man, proud of existing, takes his revenge,
listens to his blood and his nerves, heeds his prejudices, answers,
blow for blow, and kills. But the mind undermined by the fear of
death no longer reacts to external solicitations: it sketches out actions
and leaves them unfinished; reflects upon honor, and loses it . . . tries
out passions, and dissects them . . . This dread which accompanies
its gestures enervates their vigor; its desires expire before the vision
of universal insignificance. Filled with hatred by necessity, unable to
be so by conviction, the plots and crimes of such a man are halted
in mid-course; like all men, he conceals a murderer inside himself,
but a murderer imbued with resignation, and too weary to crush his
enemies or to create new ones. He dreams, forehead on his dagger,
and as though disappointed, before they happen, by every crime ;
considered a good man b y everyone, h e would be wicked i f h e did
not find it futile to be so.

Views on Tolerance
Signs of life cruelty, fanaticism, intolerance ; sighs of decadence :
amenity, understanding, indulgence . . . So long as an institution is
b ased on strong instincts, it admits neither enemies nor heretics: it
massacres, burns, or imprisons them. Stakes, scaffolds, prisons! it is
not wickedness which invented them, but conviction, any utter
conviction. Once a belief is established the police will guarantee its
'truth' sooner or later. Jesus - once he wanted to triumph among
men - should have been able to foresee Torquemada, ineluctable
consequence of Christianity translated into

history. And if the Lamb

failed to anticipate the torturer of the Cross, his future defender,
then he deserves his nickname . By the Inquisition, the Church
proved that it still possessed enormous vitality; similarly, the kings
by their 'royal will . ' All authorities have their Bastille: the more

Abdications
powerful an institution, the less humane. The energy of a period is
measured by the beings that suffer in it, and it is by the victims it
provokes that a religious or political belief is affirmed, bestiality
being the primal characteristic of any success in time. Heads fall
where an idea prevails; it can prevail only at the expense of other
ideas and of the heads which conceived or defended them.
History confirms skepticism; yet it is and

lives only by trampling

over it; no event rises out of doubt, but all considerations of events
lead to it and justifY it. Which is to say that tolerance - supreme goo d
o n earth - i s a t the same time the supreme evil. To admit all points
of view, the most disparate beliefs, the most contradictory opinions,
presupposes a general state of lassitude and sterility. Whence we
arrive at this miracle: the adversaries coexist - but precisely b ecause
they can no longer be adversaries; opposing doctrines recognize each
other's merits because none has the vigor to assert itself. A religion
dies when it tolerates truths which exclude it; and the god in whose
name one no longer kills is dead indeed. An absolute perishes: a
vague glow of earthly paradise appears, a fugitive gleam, for intoler­
ance constitutes the law of human affairs. Collectivities are reinforced
only under tyrannies, and disintegrate in a regime of clemency; then,
in a burst of energy, they begin to strangle their liberties and to
worship their j ailers, crowned or commoners.
The periods of fear predominate over those of calm; man is much
more vexed by the absence than by the profusion of events; thus
History is the bloody product of his rejection of boredom.

Sartorial Philosophy
With what tenderness, and what jealousy, my thoughts turn toward
the desert fathers and toward the cynics! The abjection of owning
the merest obj ect: this table, this bed, these rags . . . Clothes get
between us and nothingness. Look at your body in a mirror : you

will realize that you are mortal; run your fingers over your ribs as
though across a guitar, and you will see how close you are to the

177

A Short History of Decay

grave. It is because we are dressed that we entertain immortality:
how can we die when we wear a necktie? The corpse that decks
itself out fails to recognize itself, and imagining eternity, appropri­
ates that illusion. Flesh covers the skeleton, clothes cover the flesh:
subterfuge of nature and of man, instinctive and conventional
deceptions: a gentleman cannot be kneaded of clay and dust . . .
Dignity, decency - so many escapes in the face of the irremediable.
And when you put on a hat, who would say that you have sojourned
among entrails or that the worms will gorge on your fat?
. . . This is why I shall abandon these rags and, casting away the
mask of my days, flee the time when, in collusion with the others,
I strive to betray myself. There was a time when solitaries stripped
themselves of everything, in order to identifY with themselves; in
the desert or in the street, delighting in their nakedness, they attained
to the supreme fortune: they were the equals of the dead . . .

Among the Dregs

To console myself for the remorse of sloth, I take the path to the
lower depths, impatient to degrade myself and identifY with the gutter.
I y'U.� O\V these grandiloquc11t, :;ti...-�L.�g, :;nccr.ll1g bu.ms, engulfed in
their filth, I take my pleasure in their fetid breath no less than in their
verve. Pitiless for those who succeed, their genius for doing nothing
compels admiration, though the spectacle they afford is the saddest
in the world: poets without talent, whores without clients, business­
men without a penny, lovers without glands, inferno of women no
one wants . . . Behold then, I tell myself, man's negative fulfillment,
behold, laid bare, this being who pretends to a divine lineage, pathetic
counterfeiter of the absolute . . . Here is where he was to end, in this
spitting image of himself, mud God never laid a hand on, beast no
angel has a part in, infinity begotten in moans, soul risen out of a
spasm . . . I contemplate that dim despair of spermatozoa that have
reached their end, these funeral countenances of the race. I am reas­
sured: I have a way to go still . . . Then I am frightened: shall I too

Abdications
fall so low? And I hate that toothless crone, this rhymer without
verses, these impotents of love and affairs, these models of the
dishonor of the mind and the flesh . . . The man's eyes overwhelm
me; I wanted to reap, on contact with these wrecks, a harvest of
pride; I take away a shudder like the one a living man would experi­
ence who, to delight in not being dead, pilfered a coffin . . .

On an Entrepreneur of Ideas
He tries everything, and for him everything succeeds; nothing of
which he is not the

contemporary.

So much vigor in the artifices of

the intellect, so much readiness to confront all the realms of the
mind and of fashion - from metaphysics to movies - dazzles, must
dazzle. No problem resists him, no phenomenon is foreign to him ,
no temptation leaves him indifferent. He is a conqueror, and has but
one secret:

his lack of emotion;

nothing keeps him from dealing with

anything since he does so with no accent of his own. His construc­
tions are magnificent, but without salt: categories swell with intimate
experiences , classified as in a file of disasters or a catalogue of anx­
ieties. Here are ranged the tribulations of man, as well as the poetry
of his laceration. The Irremediable has turned into

a

system, even

a side show, displayed like an article of common commerce, a true
mass product of anguish. The public delights in it; the nihilism of
the boulevard and the bitterness of the cafe feed on it.
Thinker without fate, infinitely empty and marvelously ample,
he exploits his thought, wants it to be on every mouth. No destiny
pursues him: born in the age of materialism, he would have followed
its facility and given it an unimaginable extension; out of romanti­
cism he would have constituted a Summa of reveries; appearing in
the world of theology, he would have wielded God like any other
concept. His skill in confronting the great problems is disconcerting:
everything is remarkable, except authenticity. Basically non-poet, if
he speaks of nothingness, h e lacks its shudder; his disgusts are
pondered; his exasperations controlled and invented after the fact;

179

A Short History of Decay

but his will, supernaturally effective, is at the same time so lucid, that
he could be a poet if he wanted to, and I should add, a saint, if he
insisted . . . Having neither preferences nor oppositions, his opinions
are accidents; one regrets that he believes in them; only the move­
ment, the method, of his thought is of interest. Were I to hear him
preach from the pulpit I would not be surprised, so true is it that he
locates himself beyond all truths, masters them, so that none is
necessary or organic to him . . .
Advancing like an explorer, he conquers realm after realm; his
steps no less than his thoughts are enterprises; his brain is not the
enemy of his instincts; he rises above the rest, having suffered neither
fatigue nor that vehement mortification which paralyzes desire . Son
of a period, he expresses its contradictions, its futile dilation; and
when he flung himself forward in its conquest, he employed so
much pertinacity and stubbornness that his success and his renown
equal those of the sword and rehabilitate the mind by means which,
hitherto, were hateful or unknown to it.

Truths of Temperament

model themselves on the forms of their time, appear others of
whom we feel that appearing whenever, they would have been the
same, themselves, unconcerned by their age, draWing their thoughts
from their own depths, from the specific eternity of their flaws.
They take from their environment only the surface, a few peculi­
arities of style, a few characteristic turns of a given development.
In love with their fate, they suggest explosions, tragic and solitary
fulgurations, something between apocalypse and psychiatry. A
Kierkegaard, a Nietzsche, had they appeared in the most anodyne
age, would have had no less tremulous, no less incendiary an inspir­
ation. They perished in their flames; a few centuries earlier, they
would have perished in those of the stake: vis-a-vis general truths,
they were predestined to heresy. It matters little that one be engulfed

180

Abdications
in one's own fire or in that kindled for you: the truths of temperament
must be paid for in one way or another. The viscera, the blood, the
miseries, and the vices converge to beget them. Impregnated with
subj e ctivity, we perceive a

self b ehind

each of them: everything

becomes confession: a shriek of the flesh is at the source of the most
banal utterance; even a theory of impersonal appearance serves
only to betray its author, his secrets, his sufferings: no universality
which is not his mask: even logic, everything is an excuse for his
autobiography; his 'self' has infested ideas, his anguish has been
convened into a criterion, into the sole reality.

Flayed Alive
What life is left him robs him of what reason is left him. Trifles or
scourges - the passing of a fly or the cramps of the planet - horrify
him equally. With his nerves on fire, he would like the e arth to be
made of glass, to shatter it to smithereens; and with what thirst he
would fling himself toward the stars to reduce them to powder, one
by one . . . C rime glistens in his eyeballs; his hands tighten in vain
to strangle. Life is transmitted like a leprosy: too many creatures for a
single murderer. It is in the nature of the man who cannot kill himself
to seek revenge against whatever enjoys existing. And failing, he
mopes like a damned soul infuriated by impossible destructions. A
discarded Satan, he weeps, pounds his breast, bows his head; the
blood he wanted to shed fails to redden his own cheeks whose pallor
reflects his disgust with that secretion of hopes produced by the
advancing species . His great dream was to destroy the days of Cre­
ation . . . he renounces his dream, collapses into himself, and yields
to the elegy of his own failure: another order of excess is the result.
His skin burns: fever fills the universe; his brain is on fire: the air is
inflammable . His ills fill sidereal space ; his griefs make the poles
tremble . And whatever is allusion to existence, the most impercept­
ible breath of life , wrings from him a cry which compromises the
music of the spheres and the movement of the stars.

181

A Short History of Decay

Incompatibilities
A mind compels us only by its incompatibilities, by the tension of
its movements, by the divorce of its opinions from its inclinations.
Marcus Aurelius, engaged on remote expeditions, tends more toward
the idea of death than toward that of the Empire; Julian, made
emperor, regrets his contemplative life, envies the sages, and wastes
his nights polemicizing against the Christians; Luther, with a vandal's
vitality, sinks and mopes in the obsession of sin, and without finding
an equilibrium between his delicacies and his crudities; Rousseau,
who mistakes his instincts, lives only in the idea of his sincerity;
Nietzsche , whose entire oeuvre is nothing but a hymn to power, drags
out a sickly existence of a poignant monotony . . .
For a mind matters only to the degree that it deceives itself as to
what it wants, what it loves, or what it hates; being several, it cannot
choose

itself.

A pessimism without raptures, an agitator of hopes

without bitterness, deserves only scorn. Only the man who has no
regard for his past, for propriety, logic, or consideration is worthy
of our attachment: how can we love a conqueror if he fails to plunge
into events with a suspicion of failure . or a thinker if he has not
conquered his instinct for self-preservation? Man fallen back on his
futility is no longer concerned with the desire to have a life . . . If
he were to have one, or were not - would concern the others . . .
Apostle of his fluctuations, he no longer encumbers himself with
an ideal identity; his temperament constitutes his sole doctrine, and
the whim of the moment his sole knowledge.

Restoration of a Cult
Having

eroded

my quality as a man, nothing is any longer of any

value . Everywhere all I see are animals with an ideal that herd

r82

are constrained to do so like ghosts, or else to what end have we
conceived the ' communion' of saints? In pursuit of a true solitary,
I scrutinize the ages, and I find there, and envy there, only the Devil
. . . Reason banishes him, the heart craves him . . . Spirit of lies,
Prince of darkness, the Evil One the Enemy - how sweet it is to
murmur the names that flayed his solitude! And how I cherish him
since his daily relegation! If only I could re-establish him in his primal
state! I believe in him with all my incapacity to believe. His company
is necessary to me : a lonely being tends toward the loneliest being
- toward the One . . . l owe it to myself to tend toward him: my
power to admire - fearing to remain unemployed - compels me to
it. Behold me confronting my model; attaching myself to him, I
punish my solitude for not being total, I forge out of it another
which transcends it: it is my way of being humble

...

We replace God as best we can; for every god is good, provided
he perpetuates in eternity our desire for a crucial solitude . . .

We Troglodytes
Values do not accumulate: a generation contributes something

new

only by trampling on what was unique in the preceding generation.
This is even more the case in the succession of centuries: the Renais­
sance could not 'save' the depth, the phantoms, the genre of savagery
of the Middle Ages; the Enlightenment in its turn preserved only the
sense of the universal from the Renaissance, without the pathos which
marked its physiognomy. The modern illusion has plunged man into
the swoons of becoming: he has lost his footing in eternity, his
'substance .' Every conquest, spiritual or political, implies a loss; every
conquest is an

affirmation

. . . but a murderous one. In the realm of

art - the only one in which we can speak of the

life of the mind - an

'ideal' is established only on the ruins of its predecessor: each true
artist is a traitor to his forebears . . . There is no superiority in history:
republic-monarchy; romanticism-c1assicism; liberalism-autocracy;
naturalism-abstraction; irrationalism-intellectualism - institutions,

A Short History of Decay

like currents of thought and feeling, are of equal worth. No form of
mind can assume another; we are something only by exclusion: no one
can reconcile order and disorder, abstraction and immediacy, impulse
and fatality. The periods of synthesis are not creative: they summarize
the fervor of the others, a confused, chaotic resume - every eclecti­
cism being an indication of an ending.
Every step forward is followed by a step back: this is the unfruitful
oscillation of history - a stationary . . . becoming. That man should
have let himself be duped by the mirage of Progress is what renders
his claims to subtlety absurd. Progress? Perhaps we can find it in
hygiene . . . But anywhere else? In scientific discoveries? After all,
no more than deadly glories . . . Who, in good faith, could choose
between the stone age and the age of modern weapons? As close
to the ape in one as in the other, we scale the clouds for the same
reasons we shinnied up trees: the means of our curiosity pure or
criminal are all that have changed, and - with disguised reflexes - we
are more diversely rapacious. A mere whim to accept or reject a
period: we must accept or reject history en bloc. The notion of
progress makes us all dolts on the pinnacles of time; but these
pinnacles do not exist: the troglodyte who trembled with fear in the
caves still trembles in the skyscrapers. Our capital of misery remains
ancestors: that of having invested our capital better, since our disas­
ter is better organized.

Physiognomy of a Failure

Monstrous dreams inhabit groceries and churches: I have come
across no one who did not live in delirium. Since the merest desire
conceals a source of insanity, it is enough to conform to the instinct
of self-preservation to deserve the asylum. Life - a fit of lunacy
throttling matter . . . I breathe: enough to be put away . . . Incapable
of attaining to the lucidities of death, I crawl in the shadow of the
days, and I yet am only by the will no longer to be . . .

Abdications
Once I thought I could crush space with a blow of my fist, play
with the stars, halt time or wield it according to my whim. The great
captains seemed to me the great cowards, the poets, wretched stam­
merers; not knowing the resistance things, men, and words offer us,
and supposing I felt more than the universe allowed, I gave myself
up to a suspect infinity, to a cosmogony resulting from a puberty
unfit to end itself . . . How e asy it is to believe yourself a god by the
heart, and how hard it is to be one by the mind! And with how many
illusions must I have been born in order to be able to lose one every
day! Life is a miracle bitterness destroys.
The interval separating me from my corpse is a wound; yet I aspire
in vain to the seductions of the grave: unable to rid myself of
anything, to cease breathing either, everything in me suggests that
the worms will be out of work when they get to my instincts. As
incompetent in life as in death, I loathe myself and in this loathing I
dream of another life, another death. And for having sought to be a
sage such as never was, I am only a madman among the mad . . .

Procession of Sub-Men
Committed beyond his means, beyond his instincts, man has ended
up in an impasse. He has burned his bridges . . . to catch up with
his conclusion; animal without a future, he has foundered in his
ideal, he has worsted himself at his own game. Having ceaselessly
sought to transcend himself, he is paralyzed; and his only remaining
resource is to recapitulate his follies, to expiate them, and to commit
a few more . . .
Yet there are some to whom even this resource remains forbid­
den: 'Unaccustomed to being men,' they murmur, 'do we still belong
to a tribe, a race, a breed? So long as we had the prejudice of life ,
w e espoused a n error which kept u s on a footing with the others
. . . But we have escaped the race . . . Our lucidity, crumbling our
skeleton, has reduced us to a limp existence - invertebrate rabble
stretching out on matter to corrupt it with slobber. Behold us among

the slime, behold us at that laughable end where we pay for having
misused our faculties and our dreams . . . Life was not our lot: at
the very moments when we were drunk with life, all our j oys came
from our transports above it; taking revenge , life lugs us toward its
lower depths: procession of sub-men toward a sub-life . .

Quousque Eadem?
Forever be accursed the star under which 1 was born, may no sky
protect it, let it crumble in space like a dust without honor! And let
the traitorous moment that cast me among the creatures be forever
erased from the lists of Time ! My desires can no longer deal with
this mixture of life and death in which eternity daily rots. Weary of
the future , 1 have traversed its days, and yet 1 am tormented by the
intemperance of unknown thirsts. Like a frenzied sage, dead to the
world and frantic against it, 1 invalidate my illusions only to irritate
them the more . This exasperation in an unforeseeable universe where nonetheless everything repeats itself - will it never come to
an end? How long must 1 keep telling myself: 'I loathe this life 1
idolize?' The nullity of our deliriums makes us all so many gods

system of

disorders? Our fate being to rot with the continents and the stars,
we drag on, like resigned sick men, and to the end of time, the
curiosity of a denouement that is foreseen, frightful, and vain.

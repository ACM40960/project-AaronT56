bearing on a certain working and the certainty that the operations
(mental or material) entailed are within the capabilities of anyone.

without loss of all reality to the result the seeker who engages in such

Another non-satisfaction occurs, or can occur, within possession;

to create something higher than one s self.)
Transcendence is thus evoked as referring to man; but is not this
negating it, absorbing it into experience?
This objection takes for granted the figuration of experience as
being a sort of given element, more or less, without form; and it
ignores the impossibility of a representation of experience.

PRIMARY & SECONDARY REFLECTION:
THE EXISTENTIAL FULCRUM ..
page 77
Once we have

the definition of the intelligible medium in which
philosophic thought evolves (unfolds itself), the question of the
relation between reflection and life inevitably comes up. It must be
said that, contrary to a thesis common amongst the romantic philoso
phers, this relation is not an opposition. Reflection occurs when, life

coming up against a certain obstacle, or again, being checked by a
certain break in the continuity of experience, it becomes necessary
to pass from one level to another, and to recover on this higher plane
the unity which had been lost on the lower one. Reflection appears in

other thinkers, representing various national cultures, all men of

fancy

that every speculative thinker, however solid he may believe the

down in him, a sceptic a sceptic to whom the history of philo

When

called these lectures a search for, or an

investigation into, the essence of spiritual reality, I was not
choosing words at random. From my point of view such a term

philosophy. Philosophy will always, to my

demonstration. And,

the philosopher

who

first

;

discovers certain truths and then sets

out to expound them in their dialectical or systematic inter
connections always runs the risk of profoundly altering the nature
of the truths he has discovered.

Furthermore, I will not disguise from you the fact that when
had been nominated by the University of Aberdeen to deliver
the Gifford Lectures. in 1949 and 19^0, my first reaction was a
of intense inner disturbance. The honour that was
feeling
being
done to me faced me with a serious personal problem. Was I not,
in fact, being asked to do something which it had been
my con
stant determination not to do namely, to present in a
systematic
form material which, I repeat, has always remained for me at the

stage

All the same,

I

could not help considering

this

nomination

upon me. And it has always been my conviction that,
however unexpected such calls might be, I ought to respond to
them with such strength and skill as I possess always supposing

as a call

that they are

the kind of

principle does not apply, obviously enough, to the appeals that

I

am

thinking, for instance, of somebody who asked me, a few months
ago, to squeeze the core of my philosophy into a couple of sen

guilty of

what would be, from

my own

point of view,

an indefensible betrayal.

At the same time, it was clear to me that in answering this
must continue to respect the specific character of what has
always been my own line of development. And, of course, those
who made this offer to me would have that line of development
in view.

without, indeed, taking any
account at all of whatever modes may prevail at the moment in

with the Hegelian or the Thomist tradition, for instance. If I was
able to accept this offer, and if in the end I felt that I ought to
accept it, the reason was that what was being asked of me was,
at bottom, merely this: that I should be, that I should remain
myself. Now to be oneself, to remain oneself is a trickier matter
than most people think. There are always gaps in our personal
experience and our personal thought, and there exists a permanent
temptation to stop these up with ready-made developments
borrowed from some body of pre-existing doctrine. It would be
very presumptuous of me to assume that, at certain points, this
particular weakness will not come to light in the course of these
lectures.

down a road in a place where at first there were only tracks, is
that not equivalent to fixing in advance a certain destination at
which one intends to arrive, and must not that destination, itself,
be very exactly located? The underlying image would be that of a
a mine, or a
sanctuary whose whereabouts one knew in
grotto,
advance. It would be a matter of showing the way there to those
who for one reason or another wanted to have a look at the place,
no doubt in order to profit from its riches. But does not this
presuppose that the result we are working for has already been
achieved, even before we start working for it does it not pre
:

suppose
preliminary or original discovery of the grotto or the
sanctuary? Well, looking at the matter in my own way, I must
ask whether, in the realm of philosophy, we can really talk about

So far, it does not seem that all these preliminary points we
have been making yet allow us to discern very clearly on whose
behalf our investigations are
being pursued. I have spoken of an
audience that would act as an intermediary between the enclosed

thinking of science, with its claims to quite universal validity, at

We shall have to ask ourselves many questions about the
nature of reflective thought and about its metaphysical scope.
But from the very start we should note how necessary it will be to
be suspicious, I will not say of words themselves, but of the
images that words call up in us. I cannot enter here into the

problem of the nature of language; but, from
the very beginning of our investigations, we should bear in mind
how often it seems to get tied up in knots or I would rather say

leading on.

Now, what exactly lies behind this claim of ours, this refusal,
any price, to have the free movement of our thinking blocked?
What lies behind it is, I think, the philosophical intention seized

at

its
purity; that intention is quite certainly inseparable from
what we are accustomed to call freedom. But, as we shall see,
freedom is one of these words which need to have their meanings
very carefully elucidated; there can be no doubt that, in our own

on the other hand everything leads us to believe that a will which,

notions will have to be made more exact and worked out in more
detail, and I dare to harbour the hope that our investigations will
not be without their usefulness if they allow us to make some
contribution towards such a clarifying process.
Thus, in seeking to determine for what set of people this
work of ours can be intended, we have arrived at a distinction
between those who feel a certain inner intellectual need, not
unrelated to the more widespread inner moral need, felt by men
of good will, to seek peace and ensue it, and those who do not;

to consider certain objections that will have

I assert that an

reflection on the subject of truth. Nevertheless, there is

in a sort of no man s land where the difference between truth

away. It is, however, this very image of truth as something

Teaching, or rather certain traditional inadequate ways of

acceptance of such gross images of truth. In Dickens s novel,
Hard Times, there is a character called Mr. Gradgrind, for whom

anybody and everybody can be treated

containing truths (such as, The horse is a graminivorous quad

and evenly dealt out. Mr. Gradgrind is aware, certainly, that one

Nietzsche s thinking between two categories which cannot really
be reduced to each other.* Let us put it this way, that he was
hypnotized by a role, a purely lyrical role, which he wished
however to assume as his own role in real life, but with which he
was incapable of effectively identifying his actual self. This

These general remarks may help us to see in what sense the

enough to enable us to recognize and acknowledge how deep and
how wide the break really goes. The truth of the matter is that,

Thibon, to whom I referred just now in connection with

behind this disparagement that we ought to bring out. Here I

towards the abandonment of concrete and creative activities in
favour of abstract, depersonalized, uncreative tasks and even

Our world is more and more given over to the power of words,
and of words that have been in a great measure emptied of their
authentic content. Such words as liberty, person, democracy, are
being more and more lavishly used, and are becoming slogans, in a
world in which they are tending more and more to lose their

There is, however, one more question which we must

not only be contrary, I repeat, to all historical likelihood but
even metaphysically indefensible. For we should be forced in
that case to admit that some incomprehensible external action
or other has been brought to bear on the world but it is all too
clear that the world itself must have already contained the possi
of being broken. But what we can say, without contradict

that, as one numbs a pain. There is nothing easier than to imagine

also, with a radical incapacity to draw conclusions from the sort

not already incredible, in 1939, that men should be found ready
to launch another war when the ruins piled up by the previous
war had not yet been wholly rebuilt, and when events themselves
had demonstrated in the most peremptory fashion that war does
not pay? Possibly somebody may feel that such remarks smack of

journalism and are hardly worthy of a qualified philosopher.

On this topic, of the baleful effect of the passions if the reasonable

to ask what will remain, under any form at all, in the minds of

earth below us, we see the sky above; the ways of expressing
ourselves that derive from that situation could be changed only
if the actual mode of our insertion into the universe could be
changed; and there is no chance at present of that. When we are
with such a simple matter as the correspondence
dealing, indeed,

that the whole drift of such remarks will become clear
only when
we have got further on our way.

inner need for transcendence exactly consists of. I think we must

Let us notice in the first place that the need for transcendence

presents itself above all, is deeply experienced above all, as a kind
of dissatisfaction. But the converse does not seem to be true, it
does not seem that one would be in the right in saying that every

kind of dissatisfaction implies an aspiration towards transcen

simply in relation to her services as an unpaid cook and char

what we have here is a paradoxical conjunction, or osmosis,
on the one hand a philosophy which
of two contrasting elements
had originally been based purely on the reality of sensation, and
on the other hand an idealism whose nature was essentially
different. The first of these philosophies, so long as it remained
faithful to its first roots, was forced, for that matter, to deny to
the self all autonomous reality; one can even say, it seems to me,
that from this point of view (the point of view of Hume, for
instance) the self is built up out of its own states, or out of some
abstract and uncertain outcome of
thing which is only an

cartes is the obvious name to mention in this connection), for
which, on the contrary, the thinking self possesses an indubitable
existence, and even a real priority. I mean that for idealism the

One might be tempted

to say that for idealism it was rather the self s states of conscious

have been put forward in the first part of this lecture have pre[54]

idea of experience which robs experience of its true nature.
Here, it seems to me, is the anatomy of this error. One
cannot insist too strongly that what traditional empiricism failed
to see was that experience

is not, in
any sense, something which

kinds of saturation of experience can be imagined. An experience
can be saturated with prejudices but this means that the prejudice

from our earliest years that we must not confuse what we should

Church has even declared that this confusion is a perversion of the
understanding. But, first of all, is there any difference at all here

What, then, is the other perspective, within which a distinction

I shall refrain from
bringing in, as a solution of this problem that

occupying us, the notion of an omni-comprehensive reality;
though the latter idea dominates all Bradley s thinking, I am
afraid it is by no means invulnerable to all criticism. What we
should notice here is that the operation of including (and Bradley
builds up his Absolute by an
hierarchy of inclusions) is one which
can only be carried out within the bosom of a relatively, not
absolutely, complete system or totality which is then stretched

is

One solution presents itself naturally to the mind, which has
been adopted by numerous philosophers it consists of saying that
truth has to do exclusively with judgments. A judgment is true
or false, but one cannot talk of truth or falsity in the case of a
sensation or a sentiment. Sensations and sentiments, in all the
judgments we make about them, appear to be merely themselves.
This distinction, however, must be treated with more
caution than is commonly thought necessary. For in affirming the
of sensations and sentiments, in saying that within
self-identity

judgments and for all judgments they are simply what they are,
am I not forgetting their real nature ? Or rather for if they had a

he that he does not. What, however, makes the question really
obscure is that it is almost impossible to distinguish sharply between
the kernel of the sensation and the kind of array of emotional
overtones that encloses it, and that inevitably varies with each
individual because the background of experience as a whole, for
each individual, is different. Thus the taste of raspberries may be
linked in my case with walks in the Vosges woodlands with people

The truth is that an obligation is something that always ought

other hand it does not look as if an act of this sort can ever be

properly called a spontaneous act. It is necessary, one
might say, that the facts should exercise a sort of dumb pressure

with the notion of truth.
As always, we have been tempted to cling to a physical
representation. Just as the city of stone or wood is laid out to get
the best light available, so we have imagined the ideal city as
constructed in such a fashion that it can be illuminated by a truth
that is external to it. But the relationship is not the same in both

understand the nature of this link. To all appearances, it is neces
sary that the living personal experience should bump into some
sort of obstacle. One is tempted to use the following sort of

metaphor. A man who has been travelling on foot arrives at the
edge of a river where the bridge has been carried away by a flood.
He has no option but to call a ferryman. In an example such as that
which I have just cited, reflection does really play the part of the

ferryman.
But the same sort of thing can happen, of course, at the level
of the inner life. I am talking to a friend, and somehow I let myself

be drawn into telling him something which is an actual lie. I am
alone with myself again, I get a grip on myself, I face the fact of
this lie how was it
possible for me to tell such a whopper? I am

have here a very striking illustration of that important
notion of intercourse, on which I was expatiating the other day,
and no doubt we shall later have to remember this illustration
when we begin to discuss the topic of intersubjectivity properly
so called.

But meanwhile there are certain other observations on the
relations between reflection and life that are pertinent at this
kind of philosophy, essentially romantic, or at
point. There is a
romantic in its roots, which very willingly contrasts reflec
tion and life, sets them at opposite poles from each other; and
least

[80]

permissible to notice that this contrast, or this opposition,
often stated in metaphors of heat and cold. Reflection, because
it is

cold; it not only puts a bridle on the vital impulses,
freezes them. Let us, in this case too, take a concrete example.

atmosphere, by the music, the girl herself was a girl of unusual
beauty. The dance is over, he comes home, he feels the intoxica

not the sort of job that would make marriage a reasonable
proposition; if he were to marry this girl, they would have to

such sordid circumstances ? And so on, and so on ... It is obvious
that in such cases reflection is like the
plunge under an icy shower
that wakens one from a
pleasant morning dreaminess. But it would
be very rash to generalize from such examples, and even in regard
things to a girl.

sure that spontaneity is, for the philosopher, a really distinct
notion; it lies somewhere on these shadowy borders where

psychology and biology run into each other and merge. The young
Spanish philosopher, Julian Marias, has something relevant and
useful to say about this in his Introduction to
Philosophy .* He says
that the verb to live has no doubt a

or creation. But each one of us can ask himself, as a character in
one of my plays does, What do I live by? And this is not a matter
so much of some final purpose to which a life may be directed as
of the mental fuel that keeps a life alight from day to day. For
there are, as we know only too well, desperate creatures who
waste away, consuming themselves like lamps without oil.
But from this point of view, from the human point of view,
we can no longer think of life as mere and pure spontaneity and
by the same token we can no longer think of reflection as life s
antagonist. On the contrary, it seems to me essential that we
should grasp the fact that reflection is still part of life, that it is

animality.

an actual fway of access to a realm that is assuredly as near to us as

however), has been, through the influence of modern
thought, set at a greater and greater distance from us; so that
the realm has become more and more of a problematic realm, and

causes should be looked into; it is tied up, of course, with that

In compensation, we have still a paradox of our own to

deeply into that paradox. Can we get a closer grip on this
experience of the self as not being a somebody? Can we assign
a positive character to this experience? The experience consists,
it seems to me, in
recognizing that the definite characteristics

There is, to be sure, one difficulty that seems to arise in this
connection; we may be tempted to make a distinction between
the fact of existing and that of saying, to others or to oneself, that
one does exist. But in such a context perhaps the verb to say is
:

ambiguous. To clear away that ambiguity as far as possible, let
me say that this impossibility of doubting one s own existence of
which we have been talking seems to be linked to a kind of
exclamatory awareness of oneself; this awareness is expressed in

the small child (and, indeed, perhaps already at the level of
consciousness of the higher animals) by cries, by leaps, and so
on, though naturally with the adult its expression is more
measured and restrained more and more so, the more, for

forced to take up an attitude of radical detachment, of complete
lack of interest, towards the fact that this particular body happens
to be mine; primary reflection has to recall the facts that this
body has just the same properties, that it is liable to suffer the
same disorders, that it is fated in the end to undergo the same

destruction, as any other body whatsoever. Objectively speaking,

about the streets, perhaps I bought it in a shop; I can say it is
mine if nobody else puts in a claim for it though this is still
quite a negative condition of ownership. For the dog to be really,
not merely nominally, mine there must exist between us a more
positive set of relations. He must live, either with me, or as I,
and I alone, have decided he shall live lodged, perhaps, with a
servant or a farmer whether or not I look after him
personally,

which, on the other hand, I would be postulating as soon as I
asserted that my body was merely my instrument. And we must
notice at this point that if I do postulate such a gap, I am involved
at once in an infinite regress. The use of any instrument whatJ

soever is, as we have seen, to extend the powers of the body, or
in a sense to extend the body itself. If, then, we think of the body

being the extension of the powers of some other body (a mental
body, an astral body, or what you will) but this mental or

this
theory, does not know that it is an emission post, and is only

grasped as such at the reception post. The rose and the stone are
such for us, and not for themselves.
They send out no conscious
message. The panpyschists on the other hand (who are certainly
a much smaller
party) believe that the emission post itself already
has a certain awareness, however tenuous or diffuse one
may
suppose it to be, of the message which it is addressing to us.

the other hand, for the purposes of our

in our last chapter we probed critically at the notion of the body
as an instrument, so we must now probe at the notion of sensation
as transcription or translation of a message and following a path

given elements
[106]

in kind however many differences there may

partly different
be between the two sets, we should specially notice that both
sets must be objective, that is, fully accessible to the mind. This
is as true of the
simple rendering of a piece of plain prose out
of one language into another as of the deciphering of a cryptogram.
In both cases, the translator must have access to a code, even
though in the former case the code is nothing more than an
ordinary dictionary. In the code the elements of both sides of the
transaction, equated with each other, are fully accessible to the
mind.
;

Now in the case of sensation, just nothing at all of this sort,
or even remotely comparable to this, takes place. If I want to
exercise the activity of a translator, I must start with a given
something to work on, the text I am to translate from. This is a
sort of prior datum but the physical event prior to sensation,
which I am supposed to be translating into the language of sensa
tion, cannot be said to be a datum of mine in any sense whatsoever.
If we do not at first
acknowledge this fact, it is because we are

seems impossible that this non-given physical event should
ever be transformed into sense data or on the other hand we shall
have to bridge the gap between physical events and sense data by
postulating the existence of an intermediary order of sensibilia,
or unsensed sensa of things that are like sensations in all respects,
except that nobody is aware of them. This way out of our diffi
culty will not stand up to critical examination. At the most, it
pushes our troubles one stage farther back. How are we to under
stand the notion of a sensation which is a sensation in all respects,

except that nobody is aware of it? If we stick to the general lines
of the interpretation we started with, we shall have to treat the

unsensed sensum

as itself a

message sent out from an emission

post (but missing, in this case, its destination at the reception
and then we are back where we started. Or, on the other
post),
hand, we can, of course, treat the unsensed sensum, orthesensibilium, as something primary and unanalysable; in that case, of
course, it cannot be a message, and so the interpretation of
sensation we started with has foundered. Moreover, if we have

problem in this latter instance, we have

or unsensed sensum, whose existence we are assuming as our

notion of the thing, nobody can know anything at all.
But is there any way at all, then, out of this labyrinth?
Secondary reflection is forced to recognize that our primary
assumptions must be called in question, and that sensation, as
r

such, should certainly not be conceived on the analogy of the
transmission and reception of a message. For, and this is our
basic reason for rejecting the analogy, every kind of message,

however transmitted or received, presupposes the existence of
sensation
exactly in the way in which, as we have already seen,
every kind of instrument or apparatus presupposes the existence
of my body.
Let us see, now, if we can form a less strictly negative idea
of the conclusions to which our argument has led us, always bearing

Lavelle. All the same, at the very outset we run up against a
difficulty here, for we have got to take care that participation
like our former inadequate analogies of the
itself should not

instrument and the message be conceived in objective terms.
Here, as elsewhere, we have to deal with a sort of graduated
scale. At one end of the scale we have what is objective, what can

be possessed. A cake is brought in, I claim my share of it; it is

peremptory fashion, it is very probably to eat it, but that it may
be not to consume it at once, but to store it away somewhere, and
it
may be even to give it to someone as a present. But there are
cases in which the meaning of the verb to consume is by no
means so precise. For instance, if I claim my share of a collection

of pictures, consuming my pictures, in that case, can strictly
mean looking at them. Possibly, if I have the soul of a gambler in

only because of what

the point

that for a philosophical approach like ours, which is essentially
a concrete rather than an abstract approach, the use of examples

not merely an auxiliary process but, on the contrary, an essential
part of our method of progressing. An example, for us, is not
merely an illustration of an idea which was fully in being even
before it was illustrated. I would rather compare the pre-existing
idea to a seed I have to plant it in the genial soil that is constitu
ted by the example before I can really see what sort of a seed it
is

;

keep a watch on the soil to see what the seed grows up into.
We have thus progressed, and progressed is indeed the proper
word, towards a concept of real participation which can no longer
be translated into the language of outer objects. It is perfectly clear
that the soil to which the peasant is so passionately attached is not
something about which he can really speak. We can say that the
peasant s soil transcends everything that he sees around him,
that it is linked to his inner being, and by that we must under

stand not only to his acts but to his sufferings. The contrast
between the soil experienced in this way as a sort of inner pres
ence, and anything that a landscape may be to the amateur of

beauty who appreciates it and who selects a few epithets

rooted as could be. On the other hand, we could properly speak

of participation (though it is quite another form of participation,
of course) in such a landscape, in connection with its appreciation
by a real artist, particularly by a painter, of participation just to
the degree in which the painter is authentically creative and no
doubt we shall later on have an opportunity to emphasize the
;

intimate relationship that exists between participation and the
creative spirit.
In our remark about the presence of the soil
being linked,
for the peasant, both to his acts and his sufferings, we have
already had occasion to note that effective participation tran-

scends the traditional opposition between activity and passivity;
participation can be considered now as active, now as passive,

according to the point of view at which we place ourselves. This
is
probably true in all cases of participation, except for the limit

key, of course, to the scientist s purpose is the idea that
every phenomenon is the product of a certain given set of conditions.
In his laboratory he hopes to reconstitute the set of conditions,
however complex they may be, which, once they are fully recon
stituted, cannot fail to give rise to the phenomenon he is after,
life. In other words, he seeks to start off a

to persuade others, that he has arrived at the real origin of his
phenomenon; and he sets out to demonstrate that everything
in the universe runs perfectly smoothly by itself, without any
creative power at any time intruding. It is against belief in such

contemplative is certainly somebody essentially different from
the sort of spectator to whom a war, from a safe distance, is a
stimulating spectacle, and at the point we have reached now it is

important to see where the difference between the two lies.
It seems to me now that the
spectator, in the ordinary sense
of the word, makes as if to participate without really participating
he has emotions which are superficially similar to those of people
who really are committed to some course of action or other, but
he knows very well that in his case such emotions have no
outcome. In other words he is the playground for a game

of make-believe or let s-pretend, a game, however, which, as
children know, is not really enjoyable unless the beliefs and the
pretences are taken, for the time being at least, fairly seriously.

enemies of the theatre, like Tolstoy, no doubt intended to con
demn. But mock-belief of this sort is, of course, something quite
alien to contemplation properly so called; and it is perhaps
because we have become infected by the stage and the screen
in one way, and by the attitude of the technician in a quite other
way, that contemplation today has become something so extremely
us that we find it hard to get even a glimpse of its real
foreign to
nature. I would like, in passing, to add that it is impossible not
to ask oneself whether this almost complete vanishing away of
the contemplative activity in the modern world has not some

may conclude from all this, and it is a very important
conclusion, that contemplation, in so far as it cannot be simply
equated with the spectator s attitude and in a deep sense is even
at the
opposite pole from that attitude, must be considered as a
mode of participation, and even as one of participation s most
intimate modes. But, on the other hand, a true artist, a Vermeer,

of the searcher). This, as I
exactly suggesting the purposeful look
have said, is an intermediary example between purely practical

looking and contemplation as such; the geologist or botanist is
on the look-out for knowledge, his looking does not subserve a
practical activity in the usual sense of the term, but on the other

hand the knowledge he

is
seeking to extend may be of a wholly

that what he is looking for he would probably call a specimen.
But might we not say that the very essence of contemplation

such consists, negatively at least, in the fact that it can never
be brought to bear on a specimen as such; its object, if it has an
object, is not considered as being a member of a class or as having
a place in a series; it is considered in itself, in its uniqueness,
while for the specialist in spite of any appearance to the contrary
that uniqueness can never be taken into account, Sie kann
nicht, as the Germans say, in Betracht kommen. All this, as I have
hinted, is assuming that contemplation has an object in the ordin
ary sense, or rather that what contemplation is brought to bear
on remains merely objective for we may be allowed to ask
and the question is an extremely important one
ourselves
whether, when looking becomes contemplation, it does not
switch over its direction, turn, as it were, inwards? In so far as
we are accustomed to use the word contemplation to indicate the
as

or even on its own being, might we not very properly say that

I was also

There does, however, seem to be a very strict connection,

example might clarify things here. An artist like
Vermeer, we might say, did not paint his View of Delft just as he
would have painted some other view, if he had lived somewhere
else; rather, if he had lived somewhere else, though he might
still have been an artist, he would not have been Vermeer. He
was Vermeer in so far as the View of Delft was something he had
to paint; do not let us say, however, He was Vermeer because
he painted the View of Delft for the conjunction because in its
causal sense, has no bearing at all on the matter. Nothing, at our
present level of discourse can allow itself to be reduced to a mere
relationship of cause and effect. If for Vermeer the view of Delft
had been a mere spectacle, if he himself could have been reduced
to the condition of a mere spectator, he would never have been
able to paint his picture; let us even assert that he would not
have been an artist at all.
One might be tempted at this point

contrast, between the artist and the photographer. But even there
we would have to be cautious. For in the last analysis the photo

All these remarks should help us to

It is
very difficult indeed to define the notion of a situation,

at a definition runs the risk of
transforming the notion into that of
a set of objective relations, that

the hotel. I say the hotel has a bad situation, and underlying
my assertion there must be a grasp, by myself, of certain object
ive relationships between the hotel and its surroundings; let us
say that the hotel is near a tannery which gives out disagreeable
smells. If the hotel has a bad situation, that is because the hotel s
very purpose is to harbour travellers, and travellers will certainly
be put out by the smell of the tannery. If somebody says to me
after a certain lapse of time, The hotel has been sold, people
were no longer going to it I shall explain the hotel s failure by
its bad situation. But the notion of a situation need not
necessarily
have a merely spatial application. I can say that a man is in a good
or a bad situation. Here again, underlying my assertion, there must
be certain objective data but these data have reference to a being

are driving at is not a kind of porousness, like that, for instance, of
a sponge. It would be better to think of that sort of aptness to be

implicitness.

When I ask myself, Who am I, I who interrogate myself
about my own being? I have an ulterior motive, there is a more
fundamental question that I want to ask myself: it is this, Am I
qualified to answer this question? Ought I not to be afraid, in
fact, just because the answer to the question, Who am I ? will
be my own answer, that it will not be a legitimate answer?
finally
But such a fear implies an assumption of the following sort that
if a
legitimate answer can be finally given to the question, Who
am 1? it cannot be given by myself, but only by somebody else.
Let us notice that this is not just a stage, to be transcended by
and by, in the dialectical development of an abstract argument;

my judge s authority, to be tempted to call that condemnation
into question before which, only a short time ago, I was ready to

bow my

head.

Such observations may seem, to some of my hearers, a
little over-subtle. But I
regard them, nevertheless, as of capital
importance, for they enable us to understand why we must

objectively valid answer, to the question:

course, we touch on the central experience around which
Proust s great novel was planned and built
up. For, though we
are given certain such luminous
fragments out of the past, the
mind, all the same, has to work hard to rebuild the rest of the

tell our friends the
very simplest story, the story, say, of some
journey we have made. The story of a journey is told by someone
who has made the journey, from beginning to end, and who
inevitably sees his earlier experiences during the journey as
coloured by his later experiences. For our final impression of what
a
journey turned out to be like cannot but react on our memories
of our first impression of what the
journey was going to be like.

From all this one might be tempted to draw a very simple
and very practical conclusion: that the only
thing that can give
me an exact idea of what my life has been like will be a diary
kept regularly from day to day, like that, for instance, of Samuel
Pepys. But here we are up against new difficulties. Suppose I

At this point in the argument we have replaced, obviously,
the story-teller s problem by the reader s. During a period of
enforced leisure, brought about, let us say, by my retirement from
work, I decide to read over my old diary. A great many of the
entries, most of them perhaps, leave me absolutely cold, for they
tell me
nothing, they awaken no living memory. I read on, just
as if I were

very most, I can think of the keeping

magical result we have just been describing. Naturally, of course,
if I am an artist in words,

my diary, packed with disconnected detail, produces a chaotic
impression; but has my life really been this chaos? If it has, there

But what is true of the artist is necessarily even more true
of the man who leaves behind him, when he dies, no such tan
gible achievement. Might one say that such a man has at least
during his life done certain things, and that his life is really what
he has done, is his deeds or his acts? But about what deeds or
acts are we

The state of anxious expectation, when we really live it through

as life than as a kind of

Having, managed to do so. The French terms I use are disponibilite

availability and unavailability, but it might sound more natural if
one spoke of handiness and unhandiness, the basic idea being that
of having or not having, in a given contingency, one s resources
to hand or at hand. The self-centred person, in this sense, is
unhandy I mean that he remains incapable of responding to calls
made upon him by life, and I am not thinking merely of the appeals
for help that may be made to him by the unfortunate. I mean rather
that, over a much wider field, he will be incapable of sympathizing
with other people, or even of imagining their situation. He re

grounds, at least, for supposing that it will not be dishonoured;
to sacrifice my life, therefore, would be like throwing away such
a cheque, about which I cannot be quite certain, but which is
more probably worth something than worth nothing. But, even

the cheque is to renounce the journey; and it is even in a sense
to maim or cripple myself, for perhaps it is the thought of this
journey that has been mainly keeping me going. I will have to find
a new reason for carrying on, a new foundation to build my life
on, and this is something difficult to do, and often very painful
to do. But surely at this point we have come back
again to the
notion of sacrifice in the true sense of the word, and we have
left the realm of discourse in which we can

I have said that
giving my life seems the same as giving myself;
does this mean that I am merging myself and my life together into
a single confused concept?
By no means. Let us notice that I said
giving my life seemed the same as giving myself, not as doing
away with myself. Self-sacrifice can be confused with self-slaughter
only by the man who is looking on the hero s or the martyr s
act from the outside, from its material aspect merely, and who is
therefore incapable of associating himself sympathetically with
the inner essence of the act. On the other hand, the person who is
carrying the act out has, without any doubt at all, the feeling that
through self-sacrifice he is reaching self-fulfilment given his own
situation and that of

proposition from which it arose. I cannot speak of my life without
asking myself what point it has, or even whether it points in any
direction at all and even if I decide that it is in fact a pointless

raised the question presupposes the assumption that life, in some
cases at least, might have a point. If I could really uproot this
business, that

it

assumption from my mind, at the same stroke my life would cease
to be my own life. I mean that I would cease to apprehend it as
my own this would be that final estrangement from oneself that,
can be reached only by a slave, and by
in the ideal
limiting case,
a slave who has ceased to be aware of his own state of servitude.

And

in fact there

is

every reason to suppose that except in this

abstract sense, as an ideal limiting case, such final self-estrange
ment is inconceivable. For I think that there can be no doubt that

there does remain in every slave, fairly deep down, an obscure

awareness of having been outraged, and with this awareness at
least an indistinct, incipient protest, a feeling that one s life
ought not to be a slave s life, that its proper growth has been
thwarted.

about the possible theme of the performance in which I have

compare my situation with that of an actor who has been given
his own cues and lines, but who has not had the play as a whole read
to him and has not even been told briefly what it is about. He has
merely been told: at such and such a cue, you will make your
entrance, you will speak the following lines, accompanying your
lines
by this piece of business, then you will make your exit.
The actor has to suppose that his lines and his business, which in
themselves seem to him almost pointless have their point in rela

not affirm at the beginning of this lecture that it seems

impossible that the act by which I consecrate my life to some idea
or quest could be regarded as external to my life, but that, on the
contrary, the act rather resembles the bursting of my life into

flower? But according to the hypothesis of atheistic existentialism,
which I have just formulated, this act of consecration would be

something external to my life. The hypothesis implies, apparently,
something more or less of the following sort that my life has
come into my hands by accident, through the merest unforseeable
chance, like a notecase that one happens to find dropped on the
pavement. If I am an honest person, I have no doubt tried to return

What shall I do with it, to what use shall I put it? In this case, we
should notice that our question has a definite scope and implies
a
range of possible definite answers finding this money may give
me a chance to satisfy some old wish or to pay some old debt
or to help somebody who is not merely in a state of poverty but
in a state of wretchedness. I must make a choice between such
concrete possibilities. But such possibilities, it should be noted,
have their roots in my own life, such as it was before I found the
notecase. My life, itself, on the other hand, cannot really be

are linked to each other by a shared secret. I shall have to come
back, no doubt, to the notion of the secret as a mainspring of
intersubjectivity, but let us notice, before we leave our example,
that ties of quite a different nature
might have grown up between
the stranger and the shy young man. A man whom I run into quite
casually learns that I am very fond of coffee, coffee is desperately
scarce in France at the time, so he gives me a hint about how to get
some on the black market. One cannot say that this incident is
enough in itself to create a bond between me and him all we
have in common is a taste, and that is not enough to draw us

be possible to show that a single human relationship can work

quite obviously true of marriage. There may be moments of
drought in marriage when the wife becomes for her husband
merely that silly creature who should have been busy darning
socks, but there she was clucking round the tea table with a lot
of old hens, and there may be almost mystical moments when the
wife is acknowledged and loved as the bearer of a unique value to
which eternal bliss has been promised. One might therefore say
that there is an hierarchy of choices, or rather of invocations,

The notion of intersubjectivity is obviously capable of
multifarious developments. In the first place, it is not in any

on the more obscure and more important aspects of what

course, is the same sort of point as was made in a previous

emission and reception of

that our imaginary detainee has a

by that is still obscure. It will not do to say that he or she is a
gramophone record; but only that he or she can become so if
subjected, as so often happens in our contemporary world, to
persistent questioning, and will become so only to the degree
to which dehumanizing treatment brings about a state of selfestrangement. All we can say is that from the very start there was
something that could become, or rather could be degraded into,

forces us to recognize that we cling to our past in a very uneven

way, that we are our past in a very uneven way, and it must be
added that this unevenness is related to a similar unevenness in
our present situation. Here, as several times before, it is Marcel
Proust who can set us on our way. In other words, we must not
believe that we can at some given moment make a distinction
that will be valid for all the rest of our lives between what I am

the nature of the manifoldness, we should make the following
observation. At the level of feeling as such, quality (and most
philosophers of the past have acknowledged this fact without,
however, recognizing its implications) infringes upon, or one
might even say usurps, the place of subjectivity as such. A felt

can make a distinction, for instance, between seeing a colour and

spite of what the Herbartian psychologists thought, a feeling, as
such, cannot be reduced to a mere play of images. What is intrin
sic to a human life, as it is
experienced from the inside, is that
it can no more be translated into terms of film than it can be
adequately translated as we have seen already that it cannot
into terms of story. But can we transform these
negative state

ments into some kind of positive assertion? This is just where we
have to be careful, for, having set the idea of succession aside, we
are obviously in danger of coming back to a representation of the
inner reality of my life as something static and invariable, some
thing that cannot be budged. But such a view of things would be
complete illusion. Everything budges; there is every reason to

in mind, in 1938, was that of narrow tongues of water, like those
which crisscross among clusters of Dalmatian islands, at the
mouths of which one catches a sudden bewildering glimpse of the
whole broad dazzle of the sea. Our experience of depth does
seem to be linked, in this way, to the feeling that a promise is

Let us notice, however, that what we have been expressing
in terms of space could also be expressed in terms of time. And

change of key is of the liveliest interest to us here, in relation

profound notion, is the one that pushes well ahead; it opens, that
is, a long path that can be followed up only in time; it is like an
intuitive dive into an
investigation which can be developed only
over a long period of lived, personal, human time. Nevertheless,
it would
certainly be wrong to interpret the notion of depth in
terms of mere futurity. What is important is that, from our present

It
ought to be noticed, before we go on any further, that
the point of view from which we are considering the reality of the
family bond is what might be called a metasociological one. I

mean, simply, that we are going deeper than sociology does.
Sociology, so long as it remains at its own proper level, cannot
begin to state our kind of problem: which is, in fact, our old
problem, What am I? And how is it that I am able to ask myself
what I am? with a new face.

We are living today, to be sure, or at least so it seems, in a
world in which the notion of sonship, and the notion of father
hood too, are tending to be emptied of that richness of meaning
which they possessed for other societies. The philosophy that is
tending to triumph today is the old philosophy of the eighteenth
century, of the Aufkl drung, in a new dress. For that philosophy,
the metaphysical reality of sonship is one superstition among many
others and ripe for the rubbish-heap. It is important therefore
for us to get a firm grasp of the almost completely negative
conception of sonship which is tending to define itself and to
assert

its

authority before our eyes. It seems to define itself, in
terms of a refusal a refusal to acknowledge the

all, pronounced by whom? And a penalty for
what crime ? Can one be justly punished for an offence that one is not
aware of having committed? But this is not the whole story. Let

what do I mean by presence, here ? It is not that we could not com municate with this man; we are supposing him neither deaf,

but merely physical, communication is possible the image of
the passing of messages between a reception point and an emission
point, which we have rejected on several other occasions, is in
fact quite
applicable here. Yet something essential is lacking.

However, even the term intersubjectivity might give rise to
misunderstandings, for one might conceive of a content still
an objective content that could be, as it w^ere, transmitted from
subject to subject. But the very notion of transmission must be
excluded at this level of discourse; the communion in which
presences become manifest to each other, and the transmission
of purely objective messages, do not belong to the same realm of
being; or rather, as we shall see when we embark on the subject
of the ontological mystery, properly so called, all transmission of
objective messages takes place, if we may so put it, before we
have yet reached the threshold of being.

our guard against the snares of language when I distinguish the
notion of a presence from that of an object, I run the risk, of

in a quite negative way. We shall see our way more clearly if we
say that a presence is something which can only be gathered to
oneself or shut out from oneself, be welcomed or rebuffed but
it is obvious that, between the two notions of gathering to oneo
o
self, or welcoming and seizing, there is a fundamental underlying
difference, a difference of attitude. If one thinks carefully, one
sees that I cannot gather to myself, or welcome, what is purely
and simply an object; I can only, in some sense, take it, or else
leave it. It goes without saying that the kind of taking or prehen

now we can see how

deal with the topic of death; but even
our previous arguments lead up to an
interpretation of death that will make it seem a mystery and not a
mere objective event. To judge otherwise would be to forget
everything that has been previously said about the impossibility
of severing the spiritual from the vital, and about the misunder
which all such attempts to arrive at the spiritual in a
standing,
pure state imply, of the conditions of existence under which
we belong to the world.
So far, however, we have merely been approximating,
through concrete examples, to the definition we are looking for:
but we must now try to determine, with as much precision as
possible, just

book Being and Having. I am quoting from the English translation
of the book.

One ought, however, to underline the following points. The

not judge it necessary to go over the proof that has established the
formula, is always in a position to do so if he wants to. I have

very clear that a philosophy of this sort is essentially of the nature

upon his inner resources. In other words, such a philosophy

could never be completely embodied into a kind of dogmatic
exposition of which the listener or reader would merely have
to grasp the content. It is, in fact, from this very point of view
that the question of the opposition between problem and

ought not to make a premature use. The first question, rather,
that can be asked at a strictly philosophical level is whether one
can, or cannot, affirm that in the life of the individual something
of absolute, not merely of relative, importance is at stake. It is
round this theme, in fact, that my second series of Gifford
Lectures will be building themselves up. But we can acknow
ledge even at this moment that by our labours up to this point
we have cleared away some of the obstacles from the path that
leads to an answer to this question.
These obstacles, there can be no doubt at all, have all to do
with a tendency within us to transfer the definitions and the
categories that are valid only in the purely objective world into
a realm of discourse where they do not properly apply.
Following
in the steps of Bergson, we have seen that this temptation to make
a falsely objective representation of the inner

world

is

at

work

not only when I am thinking of such a general concept as time,
but when I am thinking of what I call my own particular life and
history. We have thus been brought to recognize what one might
call

the transhistoric depth of history; which is, no doubt, the
we can take towards the idea of Eternity. Moreover,

as

we

by and by even more

clearly, the

nexus between

the ideas of Eternity and mystery is as strict a one as can be. In
the first place, Eternity cannot be anything other than a mystery;

"Other Victorians"

For a long time, the story goes, we supported a Victorian
regime, and we continue to be dominated by it even today.
Thus the image of the imperial prude is emblazoned on our
restrained, mute, and hypocritical sexuality.
At the beginning of the seventeenth century a certain
frankness was still common, it would seem. Sexual practices
had little need of secrecy; words were said without undue
reticence, and things were done without too much conceal­
ment; one had a tolerant familiarity with the illicit. Codes
regulating the coarse, the obscene, and the indecent were
quite lax compared to those ofthe nineteenth century. It was
a time of direct gestures, shameless discourse, and open
transgressions, when anatomies were shown and intermin­
gled at will, and knowing children hung about amid the
laughter of adults: it was a period when bodies "made a
display of themselves."
But twilight soon fell upon this bright day, followed by the
monotonous nights of the Victorian bourgeoisie. Sexuality
was carefully confined; it moved into the home. The conjugal
family took custody of it and absorbed it into the serious
function of reproduction. On the subject of sex, silence be­
came the rule. The legitimate and procreative couple laid
down the law. The couple imposed itself as model, enforced
the norm, safeguarded the truth, and reserved the right to
speak while retaining the principle of secrecy. A single locus
of sexuality was acknowledged in social space as well as at
the heart of every household, but it was a utilitarian and
fertile one: the parents' bedroom. The rest had only to re­
main vague; proper demeanor avoided contact with other
bodies, and verbal decency sanitized one's speech. And ster3

ile behavior carried the taint of abnormality; if it insisted on
making itself too visible, it would be designated accordingly
and would have to pay the penalty.
Nothing that was not ordered in terms of generation or
transfigured by it could expect sanction or protection. Nor
did it merit a hearing. It would be driven out, denied, and
reduced to silence. Not only did it not exist, it had no right
to exist and would be made to disappear upon its least mani­
festation-whether in acts or in words. Everyone knew, for
example, that children had no sex, which was why they were
forbidden to talk about it, why one closed one's eyes and
stopped one's ears whenever they came to show evidence to
the contrary, and why a general and studied silence was
imposed. These are the characteristic features attributed to
repression, which serve to distinguish it from the prohibi­
tions maintained by penal law: repression operated as a sen­
tence to disappear, but also as an injunction to silence, an
affirmation of nonexistence, and, by implication, an admis­
sion that there was nothing to say about such things, nothing
to.see, and nothing to know. Such was the hypocrisy of our
bourgeois societies with its halting logic. It was forced to
make a few concessions, however. If it was truly necessary
to make room for illegitimate sexualities, it was reasoned, let
them take their infernal mischief elsewhere: to a place where
they could be reintegrated, if not in the circuits of produc­
tion, at least in those of profit. The brothel and the mental
hospital would be those places of tolerance: the prostitute,
the client, and the pimp, together with the psychiatrist and
his hysteric-those "other Victorians," as Steven Marcus
would say-seem to have surreptitiously transferred the
pleasures that are unspoken into the order of things that are
counted. Words and gestures, quietly authorized, could be
exchanged there at the going rate. Only in those places would
untrammeled sex have a right to (safely insularized) forms of
reality, and only to clandestine, circumscribed, and coded
types of discourse. Everywhere else, modern puritanism im-

posed its triple edict of taboo, nonexistence, and silence.
But have we not liberated ourselves from those two long
centuries in which the history of sexuality must be seen first
of all as the chronicle of an increasing repression? Only to
a slight extent, we are told. Perhaps some progress was made
by Freud; but with such circumspection, such medical pru­
dence, a scientific guarantee of innocuousness, and so many
precautions in order to contain everything, with no fear of
"overflow," in that safest and most discrete of spaces, be­
tween the couch and discourse: yet another round of whis­
pering on a bed. And could things have been otherwise? We
are informed that if repression has indeed been the funda­
mental link between power, knowledge, and sexuality since
the e1assical age, it stands to reason that we will not be able
to free ourselves from it except at a considerable cost: noth­
ing less than a transgression of laws, a lifting of prohibitions,
an irruption of speech, a reinstating of pleasure within real­
ity, and a whole new economy in the mechanisms of power
will be required. For the least glimmer of truth is conditioned
by politics. Hence, one cannot hope to obtain the desired
results simply from a medical practice, nor from a theoretical
discourse, however rigorously pursued. Thus, one denounces
Freud's conformism, the normalizing functions of psychoa­
nalysis, the obvious timidity underlying Reich's vehemence,
and all the effects of integration ensured by the "science" of
sex and the barely equivocal practices of sexology.
This discourse on modern sexual repression holds up well,
owing no doubt to how easy it is to uphold. A solemn histori­
cal and political guarantee protects it. By placing the advent
of the age of repression in the seventeenth century, after
hundreds of years of open spaces and free expression, one
adjusts it to coincide with the development of capitalism: it
becomes an integral part of the bourgeois order. The minor
chronicle of sex and its trials is transposed into the ceremoni­
ous history of the modes of production; its trifling aspect
fades from view. A principle of explanation emerges after the

6

The History of Sexuality

fact: if sex is so rigorously repressed, this is because it is
incompatible with a general and intensive work imperative.
At a time when labor capacity was being systematically ex­
ploited, how could this capacity be allowed to dissipate itself
in pleasurable pursuits, except in those-reduced to a mini­
mum-that enabled it to reproduce itself? Sex and its effects
are perhaps not so easily deciphered; on the other hand, their
repression, thus reconstructed, is easily analyzed. And the
sexual cause-the demand for sexual freedom, but also for
the knowledge to be gained from sex and the right to speak
about it-becomes legitimately associated with the honor of
a political cause: sex too is placed on the agenda for the
future. A suspicious mind might wonder if taking so many
precautions in order to give the history of sex such an impres­
sive filiation does not bear traces of the same old prudishness:
as if those valorizing correlations were necessary before such
a discourse could be formulated or accepted.
But there may be another reason that makes it so gratify­
ing for us to define the relationship between sex and power
in terms of repression: something that one might call the
speaker's benefit. If sex is repressed, that is, condemned to
prohibition, nonexistence, and silence, then the mere fact
that one is speaking about it has the appearance of a deliber­
ate transgression. A person who holds forth in such language
places himself to a certain extent outside the reach of power;
he upsets established law; he somehow anticipates the com­
ing freedom. This explains the solemnity with which one
speaks of sex nowadays. When they had to allude to it, the
first demographers and psychiatrists of the nineteenth cen­
tury thought it advisable to excuse themselves for asking
their readers to dwell on matters so trivial and base. But for
decades now, we have found it difficult to speak on the
subject without striking a different pose: we are conscious of
defying established power, our tone of voice shows that we
know we are being subversive, and we ardently conjure away
the present and appeal to the future, whose day will be

We "Other Victorians"

hastened by the contribution we believe we are making.
Something that smacks of revolt, of promised freedom, of the
coming age of a different law, slips easily into this discourse
on sexual oppression. Some of the ancient functions of
prophecy are reactivated therein. Tomorrow sex will be good
agll.(n. Because this repression is affirmed, one can discreetly
bring into coexistence concepts which the fear of ridicule or
the bitterness of history prevents most of us from putting side
by side: revolution and happiness; or revolution and a differ­
ent body, one that is newer and more beautiful; or indeed,
revolution and pleasure. What sustains our eagerness to
speak of sex in terms of repression is doubtless this opportu­
nity to speak out against the powers that be, to utter truths
and promise bliss, to link together enlightenment, liberation,
and manifold pleasures; to pronounce a discourse that com­
bines the fervor of knowledge, the determination to change
the laws, and the longing for the garden of earthly delights.
This is perhaps what also explains the market value at­
tributed not only to what is said about sexual repression, but
also to the mere fact of lending an ear to those who would
eliminate the effects of repression. Ours is, after all, the only
civilization in which officials are paid to listen to all and
sundry impart the secrets of their sex: as if the urge to talk
about it, and the interest one hopes to arouse by doing so,
have far surpassed the possibilities of being heard, so that
some individuals have even offered their ears for hire.
But it appears to me that the essential thing is not this
economic factor, but rather the existence in our era of a
discourse in which sex, the revelation of truth, the overturn­
ing of global laws, the proclamation of a new day to come,
and the promise of a certain felicity are linked together.
Today it is sex that serves as a support for the ancient form
-so familiar and important in the West-of preaching. A
great sexual sermon-which has had its subtle theologians
and its popular voices-has swept through our societies over
the last decades; it has chastised the old order, denounced

8

The History of Sexuality

hypocrisy, and praised the rights of the immediate and the
real; it has made people dream of a New City. The Francis­
cans are called to mind. And we might wonder how it is
possible that the lyricism and religiosity that long accom­
panied the revolutionary project have, in Western industrial
societies, been largely carried over to sex.
The notion of repressed sex is not, therefore, only a theo­
retical matter. The affirmation of a sexuality that has never
been more rigorously subjugated than during the age of the
hypocritical, bustling, and responsible bourgeoisie is coupled
with the grandiloquence of a discourse purporting to reveal
the truth about sex, modify its economy within reality, sub­
vert the law that governs it, and change its future. The
statement of oppression and the form of the sermon refer
back to one another; they are mutually reinforcing. To say
that sex is not repressed, or rather that the relationship be­
tween sex and power is not characterized by repression, is to
risk falling into a sterile paradox. It not only runs counter to
a well-accepted argument, it goes against the whole economy
and all the discursive "interests" that underlie this argument.
This is the point at which I would like to situate the series
of historical analyses that will follow, the present volume
being at the same time an introduction and a first attempt at
an overview: it surveys a few historically significant points
and outlines certain theoretical problems. Briefly, my aim is
to examine the case of a society which has been loudly casti­
gating itself for its hypocrisy for more than a century, which
speaks verbosely of its own silence, takes great pains to relate
in detail the things it does not say, denounces the powers it
exercises, and promises to liberate itself from the very laws
that have made it function. I would like to explore not only
these discourses but also the will that sustains them and the
strategic intention that supports them. The question I would
like to pose is not, Why are we repressed? but rather, Why
do we say, with so much passion and so much resentment
against our most recent past, against our present, and against

We "Other Victorians"

9

ourselves, that we are repressed? By what spiral did we come
to affirm that sex is negated? What led us to show, ostenta­
tiously, that sex is something we hide, to say it is something
we silence? And we do all this by formulating the matter in
the most explicit terms, by trying to reveal it in its most
naked reality, by affirming it in the positivity of its power and
its effects. It is certainly legitimate to ask why sex was as­
sociated with sin for such a long time-although it would
remain to be discovered how this association was formed,
and one would have to be careful not to state in a summary
and hasty fashion that sex was "condemned" -but we must
also ask why we burden ourselves today with so much guilt
for having once made sex a sin. What paths have brought us
to the point where we are "at fault" with respect to our own
sex? And how have we come to be a civilization so peculiar
as to tell itself that, through an abuse of power which has not
ended, it has long "sinned" against sex? How does one ac­
count for the displacement which, while claiming to free us
from the sinful nature of sex, taxes us with a great historical
wrong which consists precisely in imagining that nature to
be blameworthy and in drawing disastrous consequences
from that belief?
It will be said that if so many people today affirm this
repression, the reason is that it is historically evident. And
if they speak of it so abundantly, as they have for such a long
time now, this is because repression is so firmly anchored,
having solid roots and reasons, and weighs so heavily on sex
that more than one denunciation will be required in order to
free ourselves from it; the job will be a long one. All the
longer, no doubt, as it is in the nature of power-particularly
the kind of power that operates in our society-to be repres­
sive, and to be especially careful in repressing useless
energies, the intensity of pleasures, and irregular modes of
behavior. We must not be surprised, then, if the effects of
liberation vis-a-vis this repressive power are so slow to mani­
fest themselves; the effort to speak freely about sex and ac-

cept it in its reality is so alien to a historical sequence that
has gone unbroken for a thousand years now, and so inimical
to the intrinsic mechanisms of power, that it is bound to
make little headway for a long time before succeeding in its
mission.
One can raise three serious doubts concerning what I shall
term the "repressive hypothesis." First doubt: Is sexual re­
pression truly an established historical fact? Is what first
comes into view-and consequently permits one to advance
an initial hypothesis-really the accentuation or even the
establishment of a regime of sexual repression beginning in
the seventeenth century? This is a properly historical ques­
tion. Second doubt: Do the workings of power, and in partic­
ular those mechanisms that are brought into play in societies
such as ours, really belong primarily to the category of re­
pression? Are prohibition, censorship, and denial truly the
forms through which power is exercised in a general way, if
not in every society, most certainly in our own? This is a
historico-theoretical question. A third and final doubt: Did
the critical discourse that addresses itself to repression come
to act as a roadblock to a power mechanism that had ope­
rated unchallenged up to that point, or is it not in fact part
of the same historical network as the thing it denounces (and
doubtless misrepresents) by calling it "repression"? Was
there really a historical rupture between the age of repression
and the critical analysis of repression? This is a historico­
political question. My purpose in introducing these three
doubts is not merely to construct counterarguments that are
symmetrical and contrary to those outlined above; it is not
a matter of saying that sexuality, far from being repressed in
capitalist and bourgeois societies, has on the contrary benefit­
ted from a regime of unchanging liberty; nor is it a matter
of saying that power in societies such as ours is more tolerant
than repressive, and that the critique of repression, while it
may give itself airs of a rupture with the past, actually forms
part of a much older process and, depending on how one

We "Other Victorians"

II

chooses to understand this process, will appear either as a
new episode in the lessening of prohibitions, or as a more
devious and discreet form of power.
The doubts I would like to oppose to the repressive hy­
pothesis are aimed less at showing it to be mistaken than at
putting it back within a general economy of discourses on sex
in modern societies since the seventeenth century. Why has
sexuality been so widely discussed, and what has been said
about it? What were the effects of power generated by what
was said? What are the links between these discourses, these
effects of power, and the pleasures that were invested by
them? What knowledge (savoir) was formed as a result of this
linkage? The object, in short, is to define the regime of power­
knowledge-pleasure that sustains the discourse on human
sexuality in our part of the world. The central issue, then (at
least in the first instance), is not to determine whether one
says yes or no to sex, whether one formulates prohibitions or
permissions, whether one asserts its importance or denies its
effects, or whether one refines the words one uses to designate
it; but to account for the fact that it is spoken about, to
discover who does the speaking, the positions and viewpoints
from which they speak, the institutions which prompt people
to speak about it and which store and distribute the things
that are said. What is at issue, briefly, is the over-all "discur­
sive fact," the way in which sex is "put into discourse."
Hence, too, my main concern will be to locate the forms of
power, the channels it takes, and the discourses it permeates
in order to reach the most tenuous and individual modes of
behavior, the paths that give it access to the rare or scarcely
perceivable forms of desire, how it penetrates and controls
everyday pleasure-all this entailing effects that may be
those of refusal, blockage, and invalidation, but also incite­
ment and intensification: in short, the "polymorphous tech­
niques of power." And finally, the essential aim will not be
to determine whether these discursive productions and these
effects of power lead one to formulate the truth about sex, or

12

The History of Sexuality

on the contrary falsehoods designed to conceal that truth,
but rather to bring out the "will to knowledge" that serves
as both their support and their instrument.
Let there be no misunderstanding: I do not claim that sex
has not been prohibited or barred or masked or misap­
prehended since the classical age; nor do I even assert that
it has suffered these things any less from that period on than
. before. I do not maintain that the prohibition of sex is a ruse;
but it is a ruse to make prohibition into the basic and con­
stitutive element from which one would be able to write the
history of what has been said concerning sex starting from
the modern epoch. All these negative elements-defenses,
censorships, denials-which the repressive hypothesis
groups together in one great central mechanism destined to
say no, are doubtless only component parts that have a local
and tactical role to play in a transformation into discourse,
a technology of power, and a will to knowledge that are far
from being reducible to the former.
In short, I would like to disengage my analysis from the
privileges generally accorded the economy of scarcity and
the principles of rarefaction, to search instead for instances
of discursive production (which also administer silences, to
be sure), of the production of power (which sometimes have
the function of prohibiting), of the propagation of knowledge
(which often cause mistaken beliefs or systematic misconcep­
tions to circulate); I would like to write the history of these
instances and their transformations. A first survey made
from this viewpoint seems to indicate that since the end of
the sixteenth century, the "putting into discourse of sex," far
from undergoing a process of restriction, on the contrary has
been subjected to a mechanism of increasing incitement; that
the techniques of power exercised over sex have not obeyed
a principle of rigorous selection, but rather one of dissemina­
tion and implantation of polymorphous sexualities; and that
the will to knowledge has not come to a halt in the face of
a taboo that must not be lifted, but has persisted in constitut-

ing-despite many mistakes, o f course-a science o f sexual­
ity. It is these movements that I will now attempt to bring
into focus in a schematic way, bypassing as it were the repres­
sive hypothesis and the facts of interdiction or exclusion it
invokes, and starting from certain historical facts that serve
as guidelines for research.

PART TWO

The Repressive
Hypothesis

I
The Incitement
to Discourse

The seventeenth century, then, was the beginning of an age
of repression emblematic of what we call the bourgeois soci­
eties, an age which perhaps we still have not completely left
behind. Calling sex by its name thereafter became more diffi­
cult and more costly. As if in order to gain mastery over it
in reality, it had first been necessary to subjugate it at the
level of language, control its free circulation in speech, ex­
punge it from the things that were said, and extinguish the
words that rendered it too visibly present. And even these
prohibitions, it seems, were afraid to name it. Without even
having to pronounce the word, modern prudishness was able
to ensure that one did not speak of sex, merely through the
interplay of prohibitions that referred back to one another:
instances of muteness which, by dint of saying nothing, im­
posed silence. Censorship.
Yet when one looks back over these last three centuries
with their continual transformations, things appear in a very
different light: around and apropos of sex, one sees a veritable
discursive explosion. We must be clear on this point, how­
ever. It is quite possible that there was an expurgation-and
a very rigorous one-of the authorized vocabulary. It may
indeed be true that a whole rhetoric of allusion and metaphor
was codified. Without question, new rules of propriety
17

18

The History of Sexuality

screened out some words: there was a policing of statements.
A control over enunciations as well: where and when it was
not possible to talk about such things became much more
strictly defined; in which circumstances, among which
speakers, and within which social relationships. Areas were
thus established, if not of utter silence, at least of tact and
discretion: between parents and children, for instance, or
teachers and pupils, or masters and domestic servants. This
almost certainly constituted a whole restrictive economy,
one that was incorporated into that politics of language and
speech-spontaneous on the one hand, concerted on the
other-which accompanied the social redistributions of the
classical period.
At the level of discourses and their domains, however,
practically the opposite phenomenon occurred. There was a
steady proliferation of discourses concerned with sex-spe­
cific discourses, different from one another both by their
form and by their object: a discursive ferment that gathered
momentum from the eighteenth century onward. Here I am
thinking not so much of the probable increase in "illicit"
discourses, that is, discourses of infraction that crudely
named sex by way of insult or mockery of the new code of
decency; the tightening up of the rules of decorum likely did
produce, as a countereffect, a valorization and intensification
of indecent speech. But more important was the multiplica­
tion of discourses concerning sex in the field of exercise of
power itself: an institutional incitement to speak about it, and
to do so more and more; a determination on the part of the
agencies of power to hear it spoken about, and to cause it to
speak through explicit articulation and endlessly ac­
cumulated detail.
Consider the evolution of the Catholic pastoral and the
sacrament of penance after the Council of Trent. Little by
little, the nakedness of the questions formulated by the con­
fession manuals of the Middle Ages, and a good number of
those still in use in the seventeenth century, was veiled. One

The Repressive Hypothesis

19

avoided entering into that degree of detail which some au­
thors, such as Sanchez or Tamburini, had for a long time
believed indispensable for the confession to be complete:
description of the respective positions of the partners, the
postures assumed, gestures, places touched, caresses, the pre­
cise moment of pleasure-an entire painstaking review of the
sexual act in its very unfolding. Discretion was advised, with
increasing emphasis. The greatest reserve was counseled
when dealing with sins against purity: "This matter is similar
to pitch, for, however one might handle it, even to cast it far
from oneself, it sticks nonetheless, and always soils. "l And
later, Alfonso de' Liguori prescribed starting-and possibly
going no further, especially when dealing with children­
with questions that were "roundabout and vague."2
But while the language may have been refined, the scope
of the confession-the confession of the flesh-continually
increased. This was partly because the Counter Reformation
busied itself with stepping up the rhythm of the yearly con­
fession in the Catholic countries, and because it tried to
impose meticulous rules of self-examination; but above all,
because it attributed more and more importance in penance
-and perhaps at the expense of some other sins-to all the
insinuations of the flesh: thoughts, desires, voluptuous ima­
ginings, delectations, combined movements of the body and
the soul; henceforth all this had to enter, in detail, into the
process of confession and guidance. According to the new
pastoral, sex must not be named imprudently, but its aspects,
its correlations, and its effects must be pursued down to their
slenderest ramifications: a shadow in a daydream, an image
too slowly dispelled, a badly exorcised complicity between
the body's mechanics and the mind's complacency: every­
thing had to be told. A twofold evolution tended to make the
flesh into the root of all evil, shifting the most important
moment of transgression from the act itself to the stirrings

-so difficult to perceive and formulate-of desire. For this
was an evil that afflicted the whole man, and in the most
secret of forms: "Examine diligently, therefore, all the facul­
ties of your soul: memory, understanding, and will. Examine
with precision all your senses as well. . . . Examine, more­
over, all your thoughts, every word you speak, and all your
actions. Examine even unto your dreams, to know if, once
awakened, you did not give them your consent. And finally,
do not think that in so sensitive and perilous a matter as this,
there is anything trivial or insignificant."3 Discourse, there­
fore, had to trace the meeting line of the body and the soul,
following all its meanderings: beneath the surface of the sins,
it would lay bare the unbroken nervure of the flesh. Under
the authority of a language that had been carefully expur­
gated so that it was no longer directly named, sex was taken
charge of, tracked down as it were, by a discourse that aimed
to allow it no obscurity, no respite.
It was here, perhaps, that the injunction, so peculiar to the
West, was laid down for the first time, in the form of a
general constraint. I am not talking about the obligation to
admit to violations of the laws of sex, as required by tradi­
tional penance; but of the nearly infinite task of telling­
telling oneself and another, as often as possible, everything
that might concern the interplay of innumerable pleasures,
sensations, and thoughts which, through the body and the
soul, had some affinity with sex. This scheme for transform­
ing sex into discourse had been devised long before in an
ascetic and monastic setting. The seventeenth century made
it into a rule for everyone. It would seem in actual fact that
it could scarcely have applied to any but a tiny elite; the great
majority of the faithful who only went to confession on rare
occasions in the course of the year escaped such complex
prescriptions. But the important point no doubt is that this
obligation was decreed, as an ideal at least, for every good

Christian. A n imperative was established: Not only will you
confess to acts contravening the law, but you will seek to
transform your desire, your every desire, into discourse. In­
sofar as possible, nothing was meant to elude this dictum,
even if the words it employed had to be carefully neutralized.
The Christian pastoral prescribed as a fundamental duty the
task of passing everything having to do with sex through the
endless mill of speech.4 The forbidding of certain words, the
decency of expressions, all the censorings of vocabulary,
might well have been only secondary devices compared to
that great sUbjugation: ways of rendering it morally accept­
able and technically useful.
One could plot a line going straight from the seventeenth­
century pastoral to what became its projection in literature,
"scandalous" literature at that. "Tell everything," the direc­
tors would say time and again: "not only consummated acts,
but sensual touchings, all impure gazes, all obscene remarks
. . . all consenting thoughts."j Sade takes up the injunction
in words that seem to have been retranscribed from the
treatises of spirtual direction: "Your narrations must be
decorated with the most numerous and searching details; the
precise way and extent to which we may judge how the
passion you describe relates to human manners and man's
character is determined by your willingness to disguise no
circumstance; and what is more, the least circumstance is apt
to have an immense influence upon the procuring of that

tional libertine; but he conceived the idea of complementing
his life-which he had almost totally dedicated to sexual
activity-with a scrupulous account of every one of its epi­
sodes. He sometimes excuses himself by stressing his concern
to educate young people, this man who had eleven volumes
published, in a printing of only a few copies, which were
devoted to the least adventures, pleasures, and sensations of
his sex. It is best to take him at his word when he lets into
his text the voice of a pure imperative: "I recount the facts,
just as they happened, insofar as I am able to recollect them;
this is all that I can do"; "a secret life must not leave out
anything; there is nothing to be ashamed of . . . one can never
know too much concerning human nature."7 The solitary
author of My Secret Life often says, in order to justify his
describing them, that his strangest practices undoubtedly
were shared by thousands of men on the surface of the earth.
But the guiding principle for the strangest of these practices,
which was the fact of recounting them all, and in detail, from
day to day, had been lodged in the heart of modern man for
over two centuries. Rather than seeing in this singular man
a courageous fugitive from a "Victorianism" that would have
compelled him to silence, I am inclined to think that, in an
epoch dominated by (highly prolix) directives enjoining dis­
cretion and modesty, he was the most direct and in a way the
most naive representative of a plurisecular injunction to talk
about sex. The historical accident would consist rather of the
reticences of "Victorian puritanism"; at any rate, they were
a digression, a refinement, a tactical diversion in the great
process of transforming sex into discourse.
This nameless Englishman will serve better than his queen
as the central figure for a sexuality whose main features were
already taking shape with the Christian pastoral. Doubtless,
in contrast to the latter, for him it was a matter of augment­
ing the sensations he experienced with the details of what he

said about them; like Sade, he wrote "for his pleasure alone,"
in the strongest sense of the expression; he carefully mixed
the editing and rereading of his text with erotic scenes which
those writer's activities repeated, prolonged, and stimulated.
But after all, the Christian pastoral also sought to produce
specific effects on desire, by the mere fact of transforming it
-fully and deliberately-into discourse: effects of mastery
and detachment, to be sure, but also an effect of spiritual
reconversion, of turning back to God, a physical effect of
blissful suffering from feeling in one's body the pangs of
temptation and the love that resists it. This is the essential
thing: that Western man has been drawn for three centuries
to the task of telling everything concerning his sex; that since
the classical age there has been a constant optimization and
an increasing valorization of the discourse on sex; and that
this carefully analytical discourse was meant to yield multi­
ple effects of displacement, intensification, reorientation, and
modification of desire itself. Not only were the boundaries of
what one could say about sex enlarged, and men compelled
to hear it said; but more important, discourse was connected
to sex by a complex organization with varying effects, by a
deployment that cannot be adequately explained merely by
referring it to a law of prohibition. A censorship of sex?
There was installed rather an apparatus for producing an
ever greater quantity of discourse about sex, capable of func­
tioning and taking effect in its very economy.
This technique might have remained tied to the destiny of
Christian spirituality ifit had not been supported and relayed
by other mechanisms. In the first place, by a "public inter­
est." Not a collective curiosity or sensibility; not a new men­
tality; but power mechanisms that functioned in such a way
that discourse on sex-for reasons that will have to be exam­
ined-became essential. Toward the beginning of the eigh­
teenth century, there emerged a political, economic, and
technical incitement to talk about sex. And not so much in
the form of a general theory of sexuality as in the form of

24

The History of Sexuality

analysis, stocktaking, classification, and specification, of
quantitative or causal studies. This need to take sex "into
account," to pronounce a discourse on sex that would not
derive from morality alone but from rationality as well, was
sufficiently new that at first it wondered at itself and sought
apologies for its own existence. How could a discourse based
on reason speak of that? "Rarely have philosophers directed
a steady gaze to these objects situated between disgust and
ridicule, where one must avoid both hypocrisy and scan­
dal."g And nearly a century later, the medical establishment,
which one might have expected to be less surprised by what
it was about to formulate, still stumbled at the moment of
speaking: "The darkness that envelops these facts, the shame
and disgust they inspire, have always repelled the observer's
gaze. . . . For a long time I hesitated to introduce the loath­
some picture into this study."9 What is essential is not in all
these scruples, in the "moralism" they betray, or in the hy­
pocrisy one can suspect them of, but in the recognized neces­
sity of overcoming this hesitation. One had to speak of sex;
one had to speak publicly and in a manner that was not
determined by the division between licit and illicit, even if the
speaker maintained the distinction for himself (which is what
these solemn and preliminary declarations were intended to
show): one had to speak of it as of a thing to be not simply
condemned or tolerated but managed, inserted into systems
of utility, regulated for the greater good of all, made to
function according to an optimum. Sex was not something
one simply judged; it was a thing one administered. It was
in the nature of a public potential; it called for management
procedures; it had to be taken charge of by analytical dis­
courses. In the eighteenth century, sex became a "police"
matter-in the full and strict sense given the term at the time:
not the repression of disorder, but an ordered maximization

of collective and individual forces: "We must consolidate and
augment, through the wisdom of its regulations, the internal
power of the state; and since this power consists not only in
the Republic in general, and in each of the members who
constitute it, but also in the faculties and talents of those
belonging to it, it follows that the police must concern them­
selves with these means and make them serve the public
welfare. And they can only obtain this result through the
knowledge they have of those different assets. "lO A policing
of sex: that is, not the rigor of a taboo, but the necessity of
regulating sex through useful and public discourses.
A few examples will suffice. One of the great innovations
in the techniques of power in the eighteenth century was the
emergence of "population" as an economic and political
problem: population as wealth, population as manpower or
labor capacity, population balanced between its own growth
and the resources it commanded. Governments perceived
that they were not dealing simply with subjects, or even with
a "people," but with a "popUlation," with its specific
phenomena and its peculiar variables: birth and death rates,
life expectancy, fertility, state of health, frequency of ill­
nesses, patterns of diet and habitation. All these variables
were situated at the point where the characteristic move­
ments of life and the specific effects of institutions inter­
sected: "States are not populated in accordance with the
natural progression of propagation, but by virtue of their
industry, their products, and their different institutions.
. . . Men multiply like the yields from the ground and in
proportion to the advantages and resources they find in their
labors."ll At the heart of this economic and political problem
of population was sex: it was necessary to analyze the birth­
rate, the age of marriage, the legitimate and illegitimate
births, the precocity and frequency of sexual relations, the
ways of making them fertile or sterile, the effects of unmar­

ried life or of the prohibitions, the impact of contraceptive
practices-of those notorious "deadly secrets" which
demographers on the eve of the Revolution knew were al­
ready familiar to the inhabitants of the countryside.
Of course, it had long been asserted that a country had to
be populated if it hoped to be rich and powerful; but this was
the first time that a society had affirmed, in a constant way,
that its future and its fortune were tied not only to the
number and the uprightness of its citizens, to their marriage
rules and family organization, but to the manner in which
each individual made use of his sex. Things went from ritual
lamenting over the unfruitful debauchery of the rich, bache­
lors, and libertines to a discourse in which the sexual conduct
of the population was taken both as an object of analysis and
as a target of intervention; there was a progression from the
crudely populationist arguments of the mercantilist epoch to
the much more subtle and calculated attempts at regulation
that tended to favor or discourage-according to the objec­
tives and exigencies of the moment-an increasing birthrate.
Through the political economy of population there was
formed a whole grid of observations regarding sex. There
emerged the analysis of the modes of sexual conduct, their
determinations and their effects, at the boundary line of the
biological and the economic domains. There also appeared
those systematic campaigns which, going beyond the tradi­
tional means-moral and religious exhortations, fiscal meas­
ures-tried to transform the sexual conduct of couples into
a concerted economic and political behavior. In time these
new measures would become anchorage points for the differ­
ent varieties of racism of the nineteenth and twentieth centu­
ries. It was essential that the state know what was happening
with its citizens' sex, and the use they made of it, but also
that each individual be capable of controlling the use he
made of it. Between the state and the individual, sex became
an issue, and a public issue no less; a whole web of discourses,
special knowledges, analyses, and injunctions settled upon it.

The Repressive Hypothesis

27

The situation was similar in the case of children's sex. It
is often said that the classical period consigned it to an
obscurity from which it scarcely emerged before the Three
Essays or the beneficent anxieties of Little Hans. It is true
that a longstanding "freedom" of language between children
and adults, or pupils and teachers, may have disappeared.
No seventeenth-century pedagogue would have publicly ad­
vised his disciple, as did Erasmus in his Dialogues, on the
choice of a good prostitute. And the boisterous laughter that
had accompanied the precocious sexuality of children for so
long-and in all social classes, it seems-was gradually
stifled. But this was not a pl�in and simple imposition of
silence. Rather, it was a new regime of discourses. Not any
less was said about it; on the contrary. But things were said
in a different way; it was different people who said them,
from different points of view, and in order to obtain different
results. Silence itself-the things one declines to say, or is
forbidden to name, the discretion that is required between
different speakers-is less the absolute limit of discourse, the
other side from which it is separated by a strict boundary,
than an element that functions alongside the things said, with
them and in relation to them within over-all strategies. There
is no binary division to be made between what one says and
what one does not say; we must try to determine the different
ways of not saying such things, how those who can and those
who cannot speak of them are distributed, which type of
discourse is authorized, or which form of discretion is re­
quired in either case. There is not one but many silences, and
they are an integral part of the strategies that underlie and
permeate discourses.
Take the secondary schools of the eighteenth century, for
example. On the whole, one can have the impression that sex
was hardly spoken of at all in these institutions. But one only
has to glance over the architectural layout, the rules of disci­
pline, and their whole internal organization: the question of
sex was a constant preoccupation. The builders considered it

28

The History of Sexuality

explicitly. The organizers took it permanently into account.
All who held a measure of authority were placed in a state
of perpetual alert, which the fixtures, the precautions taken,
the interplay of punishments and responsibilities, never
ceased to reiterate. The space for classes, the shape of the
tables, the planning of the recreation lessons, the distribution
of the dormitories (with or without partitions, with or with­
out curtains), the rules for monitoring bedtime and sleep
periods-all this referred, in the most prolix manner, to the
sexuality of children.12 What one might call the internal
discourse of the institution-the one it employed to address
itself, and which circulated among those who made it func­
tion-was largely based on the assumption that this sexuality
existed, that it was precocious, active, and ever present. But
this was not all: the sex of the schoolboy became in the course
of the eighteenth century-and quite apart from that of
adolescents in general-a public problem. Doctors counseled
the directors and professors of educational establishments,
but they also gave their opinions to families; educators de­
signed projects which they submitted to the authorities;
schoolmasters turned to students, made recommendations to
them, and drafted for their benefit books of exhortation, full
of moral and medical examples. Around the schoolboy and
his sex there proliferated a whole literature of precepts, opin­
ions, observations, medical advice, clinical cases, outlines for
reform, and plans for ideal institutions. With Basedow and
the German "philanthropic" movement, this transformation
of adolescent sex into discourse grew to considerable dimen­
sions. Salzmann even organized an experimental school
12Reglement de police pour les lycees (1809). art. 67: "There shall always be, during
class and study hours, an instructor watching the exterior, so as to prevent students
who have gone out to relieve themselves from stopping and congregating.
art. 68: "After the evening prayer, the students will be conducted back to the
dormitory, where the schoolmasters will put them to bed at once.
art. 69: "The masters will not retire except after having made certain that every
student is in bed.

which owed its exceptional character to a supervision and
education of sex so well thought out that youth's universal
sin would never need to be practiced there. And with all
these measures taken, the child was not to be simply the mute
and unconscious object of attentions prearranged between
adults only; a certain reasonable, limited, canonical, and
truthful discourse on sex was prescribed for him-a kind of
discursive orthopedics. The great festival organized at the
Philanthropinum in May of 1 776 can serve as a vignette in
this regard. Taking the form of an examination, mixed with
floral games, the awarding of prizes, and a board of review,
this was the first solemn communion of adolescent sex and
reasonable discourse. In order to show the success of the sex
education given the students, Basedow had invited all the
dignitaries that Germany could muster (Goethe was one of
the few to decline the invitation). Before the assembled pub­
lic, one of the professors, a certain Wolke, asked the students
selected questions concerning the mysteries of sex, birth, and
procreation. He had them comment on engravings that de­
picted a pregnant woman, a couple, and a cradle. The replies
were enlightened, offered without shame or embarrassment.
No unseemly laughter intervened to disturb them-except
from the very ranks of an adult audience more childish than
the children themselves, and whom Wolke severely repri­
manded. At the end, they all applauded these cherub-faced
boys who, in front of adults, had skillfully woven the gar�
lands of discourse and sex.1J
It would be less than exact to say that the pedagogical
institution has imposed a ponderous silence on the sex of
children and adolescents. On the contrary, since the eigh­
teenth century it has multiplied the forms of discourse on the
subject; it has established various points of implantation for
sex; it has coded contents and qualified speakers. Speaking

about children's sex, inducing educators, physicians, ad­
ministrators, and parents to speak of it, or speaking to them
about it, causing children themselves to talk about it, and
enclosing them in a web of discourses which sometimes ad­
dress them, sometimes speak about them, or impose canoni­
cal bits of knowledge on them, or use them as a basis for
constructing a science that is beyond their grasp-all this
together enables us to link an intensification of the interven­
tions of power to a multiplication of discourse. The sex of
children and adolescents has become, since the eighteenth
century, an important area of contention around which innu­
merable institutional devices and discursive strategies have
been deployed. It may well be true that adults and children
themselves were deprived of a certain way of speaking about
sex, a mode that was disallowed as being too direct, crude,
or coarse. But this was only the counterpart of other dis­
courses, and perhaps the condition necessary in order for
them to function, discourses that were interlocking, hier­
archized, and all highly articulated around a cluster of power
relations.
One could mention many other centers which in the eigh­
teenth or nineteenth century began to produce discourses on
sex. First there was medicine, via the "nervous disorders";
next psychiatry, when it set out to discover the etiology of
mental illnesses, focusing its gaze first on "excess," then
onanism, then frustration, then "frauds against procrea­
tion," but especially when it annexed the whole of the sexual
perversions as its own province; criminal justice, too, which
had long been concerned with sexuality, particularly in the
form of "heinous" crimes and crimes against nature, but
which, toward the middle of the nineteenth century, broad­
ened its jurisdiction to include petty offenses, minor indecen­
cies, insignificant perversions; and lastly, all those social
controls, cropping up at the end of the last century, which
screened the sexuality of couples, parents and children, dan­
gerous and endangered adolescents-undertaking to protect,

separate, and forewarn, signaling perils everywhere, awaken­
ing people's attention, calling for diagnoses, piling up re­
ports, organizing therapies. These sites radiated discourses
aimed at sex, intensifying people's awareness of it as a con­
stant danger, and this in turn created a further incentive to
talk about it.
One day in 1 867, a farm hand from the village of Lapcourt,
who was somewhat simple-minded, employed here then
there, depending on the season, living hand-to-mouth from
a little charity or in exchange for the worst sort of labor,
sleeping in barns and stables, was turned in to the authorities.
At the border of a field, he had obtained a few caresses from
a little girl, just as he had done before and seen done by the
village urchins round about him; for, at the edge of the wood,
or in the ditch by the road leading to Saint-Nicolas, they
would play the familiar game called "curdled milk. " So he
was pointed out by the girl's parents to the mayor of the
village, reported by the mayor to the gendarmes, led by the
gendarmes to the judge, who indicted him and turned him
over first to a doctor, then to two other experts who not only
wrote their report but also had it published. 14 What is the
significant thing about this story? The pettiness of it all; the
fact that this everyday occurrence in the life of village sexual­
ity, these inconsequential bucolic pleasures, could become,
from a certain time, the object not only of a collective intoler­
ance but of a judicial action, a medical intervention, a careful
clinical examination, and an entire theoretical elaboration.
The thing to note is that they went so far as to measure the
brainpan, study the facial bone structure, and inspect for
possible signs of degenerescence the anatomy of this person­
age who up to that moment had been an integral part of
village life; that they made him talk; that they questioned
him concerning his thoughts, inclinations, habits, sensations,
and opinions. And then, acquitting him of any crime, they

The History of Sexuality

decided finally to make him into a pure object of medicine
and knowledge-an object to be shut away till the end of his
life in the hospital at Mareville, but also one to be made
known to the world of learning through a detailed analysis.
One can be fairly certain that during this same period the
Lapcourt schoolmaster was instructing the little villagers to
mind their language and not talk about all these things aloud.
But this was undoubtedly one of the conditions enabling the
institutions of knowledge and power to overlay this everyday
bit of theater with their solemn discourse. So it was that our
society-and it was doubtless the first in history to take such
measures-assembled around these timeless gestures, these
barely furtive pleasures between simple-minded adults and
alert children, a whole machinery for speechifying, analyz­
ing, and investigating.
Between the licentious Englishman, who earnestly re­
corded for his own purposes the singular episodes of his
secret life, and his contemporary, this village halfwit who
would give a few pennies to the little girls for favors the older
ones refused him, there was without doubt a profound con­
nection: in any case, from one extreme to the other, sex
became something to say, and to say exhaustively in accord­
ance with deployments that were varied, but all, in their own
way, compelling. Whether in the form of a subtle confession
in confidence o� an authoritarian interrogation, sex-be it
refined or rustic-had to be put into words. A great polymor­
phous injunction bound the Englishman and the poor Lor­
rainese peasant alike. As history would have it, the latter was
named Jouy. *
Since the eighteenth century, sex has not ceased to pro­
voke a kind of generalized discursive erethism. And these
discourses on sex did not multiply apart from or against
power, but in the very space and as the means of its exercise.
Incitements to speak were orchestrated from all quarters,
"Jouy sounds like the past participle of jouir, the French verb meaning to enjoy,
to delight in (something), but also to have an orgasm, to come. (Translator's note)

The Repressive Hypothesis

33

apparatuses everywhere for listening and recording, proce­
dures for observing, questioning, and formulating. Sex was
driven out of hiding and constrained to lead a discursive
existence. From the singular imperialism that compels every­
one to transform their sexuality into a perpetual discourse,
to the manifold mechanisms which, in the areas of economy,
pedagogy, medicine, and justice, incite, extract, distribute,
and institutionalize the sexual discourse, an immense verbos­
ity is what our civilization has required and organized.
Surely no other type of society has ever accumulated-and
in such a relatively short span of time-a similar quantity of
discourses concerned with sex. It may well be that we talk
about sex more than anything else; we set our minds to the
task; we convince ourselves that we have never said enough
on the subject, that, through inertia or submissiveness, we
conceal from ourselves the blinding evidence, and that what
is essential always eludes us, so that we must always start out
once again in search of it. It is possible that where sex is
concerned, the most long-winded, the most impatient of soci­
eties is our own.
But as this first overview shows, we are dealing less with
a discourse on sex than with a multiplicity of discourses
produced by a whole series of mechanisms operating in diff­
erent institutions. The Middle Ages had organized around
the theme of the flesh and the practice of penance a discourse
that was markedly unitary. In the course of recent centuries,
this relative uniformity was broken apart, scattered, and
multiplied in an explosion of distinct discursivities which
took form in demography, biology, medicine, psychiatry,
psychology, ethics, pedagogy, and political criticism. More
precisely, the secure bond that held together the moral theol­
ogy of concupiscence and the obligation of confession (equiv­
alent to the theoretical discourse on sex and its first-person
formulation) was, if not broken, at least loosened and diver­
sified: between the objectification of sex in rational dis­
courses, and the movement by which each individual was set

34

The History of Sexuality

to the task of recounting his own sex, there has occurred,
since the eighteenth century, a whole series of tensions, con­
flicts, efforts at adjustment, and attempts at retranscription.
So it is not simply in terms of a continual extension that we
must speak of this discursive growth; it should be seen rather
as a dispersion of centers from which discourses emanated,
a diversification of their forms, and the complex deployment
of the network connecting them. Rather than the uniform
concern to hide sex, rather than a general prudishness of
language, what distinguishes these last three centuries is the
variety, the wide dispersion of devices that were invented for
speaking about it, for having it be spoken about, for inducing
it to speak of itself, for listening, recording, transcribing, and
tedistributing what is said about it: around sex, a whole
network of varying, specific, and coercive transpositions into
discourse. Rather than a massive censorship, beginning with
the verbal proprieties imposed by the Age of Reason, what
was involved was a regulated and polymorphous incitement
to discourse.
The objection will doubtless be raised that if so many
stimulations and constraining mechanisms were necessary in
order to speak of sex, this was because there reigned over
everyone a certain fundamental prohibition; only definite
n�essities-economic pressures, political requirements­
were able to lift this prohibition and open a few approaches
to the discourse on sex, but these were limited and carefully
coded; so much talk about sex, so many insistent devices
contrived for causing it to be talked about-but under strict
conditions: does this not prove that it was an object of se­
crecy, and more important, that there is still an attempt to
keep it that way? But this often-stated theme, that sex is
outside of discourse and that only the removing of an obsta­
cle; the breaking of a secret, can clear the way leading to it,
is precisely what needs to be examined. Does it not partake
of the injunction by which discourse is provoked? Is it not
with the aim of inciting people to speak of sex that it is made

The Repressive Hypothesis

35

to mirror, at the outer limit of every actual discourse, some­
thing akin to a secret whose discovery is imperative, a thing
abusively reduced to silence, and at the same time difficult
and necessary, dangerous and precious to divulge? We must
not forget that by making sex into that which, above all else,
had to be confessed, the Christian pastoral always presented
it as the disquieting enigma: not a thing which stubbornly
shows itself, but one which always hides, the insidious pres­
ence that speaks in a voice so muted and often disguised that
one risks remaining deaf to it. Doubtless the secret does not
reside In that basic reality in relation to which all the incite­
ments to speak of sex are situated-whether they try to force
the secret, or whether in some obscure way they reinforce it
by the manner in which they speak of it. It is a question
rather of a theme that forms part of the very mechanics of
these incitements: a way of giving shape to the requirement
to speak about the matter, a fable that is indispensable to the
endlessly proliferating economy of the discourse on sex.
What is peculiar to modern societies, in fact, is not that they
consigned sex to a shadow existence, but that they dedicated
themselves to speaking of it ad infinitum, while exploiting it
as the secret.

2
The Perverse
Implantation

A possible objection: it would be a mistake to see in this
proliferation of discourses merely a quantitative phe}1ome­
non, something like a pure increase, as if what was said in
them were immaterial, as if the fact of speaking about sex
were of itself more important than the forms of imperatives
that were imposed on it by speaking about it. For was this
transformation of sex into discourse not governed by the
endeavor to expel from reality the forms of sexuality that
were n� amenable to the strict economy of reproduction: to
say no to unproductive activities, to banish casual pleasures,
to reduce or exclude practices whose object was not procrea­
tion? Through the various discourses, legal sanctions against
minor perversions were multiplied; sexual irregularity was
annexed to mental illness; from childhood to old age, a norm
of sexual development was defined and all the possible devia­
tions were carefully described; pedagogical controls and
medical treatments were organized; around the least fanta­
sies, moralists, but especially doctors, brandished the whole
emphatic vocabulary of abomination. Were these anything
more than means employed to absorb, for the benefit of a
genitally centered sexuality, all the fruitless pleasures? All
this garrulous attention which has us in a stew over sexuality,
is it not motivated by one basic concern: to ensure popula36

The Repressive Hypothesis

37

tion, to reproduce labor capacity, to perpetuate the form of
social relations: in short, to constitute a sexuality that is
economically useful and politically conservative?
I still do not know whether this is the ultimate objective.
But this much is certain: reduction has not been the means
employed for trying to achieve it. The nineteenth century
and our own have been rather the age of multiplication: a
dispersion of sexualities, a strengthening of their disparate
forms, a mUltiple implantation of "perversions. " Our epoch
has initiated sexual heterogeneities.
Up to the end of the eighteenth century, three major explic­
it codes-apart from the customary regularities and con­
straints of opinion-governed sexual practices: canonical
law, the Christian pastoral, and civil law. They determined,
each in its own way, the division between licit and illicit.
They were all centered On matrimonial relations: the marital
obligation, the ability to fulfill it, the manner in which one
complied with it, the requirements and violences that accom­
panied it, the useless or unwarranted caresses for which it
was a pretext, its fecundity or the way one went about making it sterile, the moments when one demanded it (dangerous
periods of pregnancy or breast-feeding, forbidden times of
Lent or abstinence), its frequency or infrequency, and so on.
It was this domain that was especially saturated with pre­
scriptions. The sex of husband and wife was beset by rules
and recommendations. The marriage relation was the most
intense focus of constraints; it was spoken of more than
anything else; more than any other relation, it was required
to give a detailed accounting of itself. It was under constant
surveillance: if it was found to be lacking, it had to come
forward and plead its case before a witness. The "rest" re­
mained a good deal more confused: one only has to think of
the uncertain status of "sodomy," or the indifference regard­
ing the sexuality of children.
Moreover, these different codes did not make a clear dis­
tinction between violations of the rules of marriage and

38

The History of Sexuality

deviations with respect to genitality. Breaking the rules of
marriage or seeking strange pleasures brought an equal meas­
ure of condemnation. On the list of grave sins, and separated
only by their relative importance, there appeared debauchery
(extramarital relations), adultery, rape, spiritual or carnal
incest, but also sodomy, or the mutual "caress." As to the
courts, they could condemn homosexuality as well as infi­
delity, marriage without parental consent, or bestiality.
What was taken into account in the civil and religious juris­
dictions alike was a general unlawfulness. Doubtless acts
"contrary to nature" were stamped as especially abominable,
but they were perceived simply as an extreme form of acts
"against the law"; they were infringements of decrees which
were just as sacred as those of marriage, and which had been
established for governing the order of things and the plan of
beings. Prohibitions bearing on sex were essentially of a
juridical nature. The "nature" on which they were based was
still a kind of law. For a long time hermaphrodites were
criminals, or crime's offspring, since their anatomical dispo­
sition, their very being, confounded the law that distin­
guished the sexes and prescribed their union.
The discursive explosion of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries caused this system centered on legitimate alliance
to undergo two modifications. First, a centrifugal movement
with respect to heterosexual monogamy. Of course, the array
of practices and pleasures continued to be referred to it as
their internal standard; but it was spoken of less and less, or
in any case with a growing moderation. Efforts to find out
its secrets were abandoned; nothing further was demanded
of it than to define itself from day to day. The legitimate
couple, with its regular sexuality, had a right to more discre­
tion. It tended to function as a norm, one that was stricter,
perhaps, but quieter. On the other hand, what came under
scrutiny was the sexuality of children, mad men and women,
and criminals; the sensuality of those who did not like the
opposite sex; reveries, obsessions, petty manias, or great tran-

The Repressive Hypothesis

sports of rage. It was time for all these figures, scarcely
noticed in the past, to step forward and speak, to make the
difficult confession of what they were. No doubt they were
condemned all the same; but they were listened to; and if
regular sexuality happened to be questioned once again, it
was through a reflux movement, originating in these periph­
eral sexualities.
Whence the setting apart of the "unnatural" as a specific
dimension in the field of sexuality. This kind of activity
assumed an autonomy with regard to the other condemned
forms such as adultery or rape (and the latter were con­
demned less and less): to marry a close relative or practice
sodomy, to seduce a nun or engage in sadism, to deceive
one's wife or violate cadavers, became things that were essen­
tially different. The area covered by the Sixth Command­
ment began to fragment. Similarly, in the civil order, the
confused category of "debauchery," which for more than a
century had been one of the most frequent reasons for ad­
ministrative confinement, came apart. From the debris, there
appeared on the one hand infractions against the legislation
(or morality) pertaining to marriage and the family, and on
the other, offenses against the regularity of a natural function
(offenses which, it must be added, the law was apt to punish).
Here we have a likely reason, among others, for the prestige
of Don Juan, which three centuries have not erased. Under­
neath ,the great violator of the rules of marriage-stealer of
wives, seducer of virgins, the shame of families, and an insult
to husbands and fathers-another personage can be
glimpsed: the individual driven, in spite of himself, by the
somber madness of sex. Underneath the libertine, the per­
vert. He deliberately breaks the law, but at the same time,
something like a nature gone awry transports him far from
all nature; his death is the moment when the supernatural
return of the crime and its retribution thwarts the flight into
counternature. There were two great systems conceived by
the West for governing sex: the law of marriage and the order

40

The History of Sexuality

of desires-and the life of Don Juan overturned them both.
We shall leave it to psychoanalysts to speculate whether he
was homosexual, narcissistic, or impotent.
Although not without delay and equivocation, the natural
laws of matrimony and the immanent rules of sexuality
began to be recorded on two separate registers. There
emerged a world of perversion which partook of that of legal
or moral infraction, yet was not simply a variety of the latter.
An entire sub-race race was born, different-despite certain
kinship ties-from the libertines of the past. From the end
of the eighteenth century to our own, they circulated through
the pores of society; they were always hounded, but not
always by laws; were often locked up, but not always in
prisons; were sick perhaps, but scandalous, dangerous vic­
tims, prey (0 a strange evil that also bore the name of vice
and sometimes crime. They were children wise beyond their
years, precocious little girls, ambiguous schoolboys, dubious
servants and educators, cruel or maniacal husbands, solitary
collectors, ramblers with bizarre impulses; they haunted the
houses of correction, the penal colonies, the tribunals, and
the asylums; they carried their infamy to the doctors and
their sickness to the judges. This was the numberless family
of perverts who were on friendly terms with delinquents and
akin to madmen. In the course of the century they succes­
sively bore the stamp of "moral folly," "genital neurosis,"
"aberration of the genetic instinct," "degenerescence," or
"physical imbalance."
What does the appearance of all these peripheral sexuali­
ties signify? Is the fact that they could appear in broad day­
light a sign that the code had become more lax? Or does the
fact that they were given so much attention testify to a
stricter regime and to its concern to bring them under close
supervision? In terms of repression, things are unclear. There
was permissiveness, if one bears in mind that the severity of
the codes relating to sexual offenses diminished considerably
in the nineteenth century and that law itself often deferred

The Repressive Hypothesis

41

t o medicine. But an additional ruse of severity, if one thinks
of all the agencies of control and all the mechanisms of
surveillance that were put into operation by pedagogy or
therapeutics. It may be the case that the intervention of the
Church in conjugal sexuality and its rejection of "frauds"
against procreation had lost much of their insistence over the
previous two hundred years. But medicine made a forceful
entry into the pleasures of the couple: it created an entire
organic, functional, or mental pathology arising out of "in­
complete" sexual practices; it carefully classified all forms of
related pleasures; it incorporated them into the notions of
"development" and instinctual "disturbances"; and it under­
took to manage them.
Perhaps the point to consider is not the level of indulgence
or the quantity of repression but the form of power that was
exercised. When this whole thicket of disparate sexualities
was labeled, as if to disentangle them from one another, was
the object to exclude them from reality? It appears, in fact,
that the function of the power exerted in this instance was
not that of interdiction, and that it involved four operations
quite different from simple prohibition.
1 . Take the ancient prohibitions of consanguine marriages
(as numerous and complex as they were) or the condemna­
tion of adultery, with its inevitable frequency of occurrence;
or on the other hand, the recent controls through which,
since the nineteenth century, the sexuality of children has
been subordinated and their "solitary habits" interfered
with. It is clear that we are not dealing with one and the same
power mechanism. Not only because in the one case it is a
question of law and penality, and in the other, medicine and
regimentation; but also because the tactics employed is not
' the same. On the surface, what appears in both cases is an
effort at elimination that was always destined to fail and
always constrained to begin again. But the prohibition of
"incests" attempted to reach its objective through an asymp­
totic decrease in the thing it condemned, whereas the control

42

The History of Sexuality

of infantile sexuality hoped to reach it through a simulta­
neous propagation of its own power and of the object on
which it was brought to bear. It proceeded in accordance
with a twofold increase extended indefinitely. Educators and
doctors combatted children's onanism like an epidemic that
needed to be eradicated. What this actually entailed,
throughout this whole secular campaign that mobilized the
adult world around the sex of children, was using these
tenuous pleasures as a prop, constituting them as secrets
(that is, forcing them into hiding so as to make possible their
discovery), tracing them back to their source, tracking them
from their origins to their effects, searching out everything
that might cause them or simply enable them to exist. Wher­
ever there was the chance they might appear, devices of
surveillance were installed; traps were laid for compelling
admissions; inexhaustible and corrective discourses were im­
posed; parents and teachers were alerted, and left with the
suspicion that all children were guilty, and with the fear of
being themselves at fault if their suspicions were not suffi­
ciently strong; they were kept in readiness in the face of this
recurrent danger; their conduct was prescribed and their
pedagogy recodified; an entire medico-sexual regime took
hold of the family milieu. The child's "vice" was not so much
an enemy as a support; it may have been designated as the
evil to be eliminated, but the extraordinary effort that went
into the task that was bound to fail leads one to suspect that
what was demanded of it was to persevere, to proliferate to
the limits of the visible and the invisible, rather than to
disappear for good. Always relying on this support, power
advanced, multiplied its relays and its effects, while its target
expanded, subdivided, and branched out, penetrating further
into reality at the same pace. In appearance, we are dealing
with a barrier system; but in fact, all around the child, indefi­
nite lines of penetration were disposed.
2. This new persecution of the peripheral sexualities en­
tailed an incorporation ofperversions and a new specification

The Repressive Hypothesis

43

of individuals. As defined by the ancient civil or canonical
codes, sodomy was a category of forbidden acts; their perpe­
trator was nothing more than the juridical subject of them.
The nineteenth-century homosexual became a personage, a
past, a case history, and a childhood, in addition to being a
type of life, a life form, and a morphology, with an indiscreet
anatomy and possibly a mysterious physiology. Nothing that
went into his total composition was unaffected by his sexual­
ity. It was everywhere present in him: at the root of all his
actions because it was their insidious and indefi!l.itely active
principle; written immodestly on his face and body because
it was a secret that always gave itself away. It was consub­
stantial with him, less as a habitual sin than as a singular
nature. We must not forget that the psychological, psychiat­
ric, medical category qf homosexuality was constituted from
the moment it was characterized-Westphal's famous article
of 1 870 on "contrary sexual sensations" can stand as its date
of birth I-less by a type of sexual relations than by a certain
quality of sexual sensibility, a certain way of inverting the
masculine and the feminine in oneself. Homosexuality ap­
peared as one of the forms of sexuality when it was tran­
sposed from the practice of sodomy onto a kind of interior
androgyny, a hermaphrodism of the soul. The sodomite had
been a temporary aberration; the homosexual was now a
species.
So too were all those minor perverts whom nineteenth­
century psychiatrists entomologized by giving them strange
baptismal names: there were Krafft-Ebing's zoophiles and
zooerasts, Rohleder's auto-monosexualists; and later, mixo­
scopophiles, gynecomasts, presbyophiles, sexoesthetic in­
verts, and dyspareunist women. These fine names for heresies
referred to a nature that was overlooked by the law, but not
so neglectful of itself that it did not go on producing more
species, even where there was no order to fit them into. The

44

The History of Sexuality

machinery of power that focused on this whole alien strain
did not aim to suppress it, but rather to give it an analytical,
visible, and permanent reality: it was implanted in bodies,
slipped in beneath modes of conduct, made into a principle
of classification and intelligibility, established as a raison
d'hre and a natural order of disorder. Not the exclusion of
these thousand aberrant sexualities, but the specification, the
regional solidification of each one of them. The strategy
behind this dissemination was to strew reality with them and
incorporate them into the individual.
3. More than the old taboos, this form of power demanded
constant, attentive, and curious presences for its exercise; it
presupposed proximities; it proceeded through examination
and insistent observation; it required an exchange of dis­
courses, through questions that extorted admissions, and
confidences that went beyond the questions that were asked.
It implied a physical proximity and an interplay of intense
sensations. The medicalization of the sexually peculiar was
both the effect and the instrument of this. Imbedded in bod­
ies, becoming deeply characteristic of individuals, the oddi­
ties of sex relied on a technology of health and pathology.
And conversely, since sexuality was a medical and medicaliz­
able object, one had to try and detect it-as a lesion, a
dysfunction, or a symptom-in the depths of the organism,
or on the surface of the skin, or among all the signs of
behavior. The power which thus took charge of sexuality set
about contacting bodies, caressing them with its eyes, inten­
sifying areas, electrifying surfaces, dramatizing troubled mo­
ments. It wrapped the sexual body in its embrace. There was
undoubtedly an increase in effectiveness and an extension of
the domain controlled; but also a sensualization of power and
a gain of pleasure. This produced a twofold effect: an impetus
was given to power through its very exercise; an emotion
rewarded the overseeing control and carried it further; the
intensity of the confession renewed the quC(stioner's curios­
ity; the pleasure discovered fed back to the power that encir-

The Repressive Hypothesis

45

eled it. But so many pressing questions singularized the
pleasures felt by the one who had to reply. They were fixed
by a gaze, isolated and animated by the attention they re­
ceived. Power operated as a mechanism of attraction; it drew
out those peculiarities over which it kept watch. Pleasure
spread to the power that harried it; power anchored the
pleasure it uncovered.
The medical examination, the psychiatric inves.!igation,
the pedagogical report, and family controls may have the
over-all and apparent objective of saying no to all wayward
or unproductive sexualities, but the fact is that they function
as mechanisms with a double impetus: pleasure and power.
The pleasure that comes of exercising a power that questions,
monitors, watches, spies, searches out, palpates, brings to
light; and on the other hand, the pleasure that kindles at
having to evade this power, flee from it, fool it, or travesty
it. The power that lets itself be invaded by the pleasure it is
pursuing; and opposite it, power asserting itself in the pleas­
ure of showing off, scandalizing, or resisting. Capture and
seduction, confrontation and mutual reinforcement: parents
and children, adults and adolescents, educator and students,
doctors and patients, the psychiatrist with his hysteric and
his perverts, all have played this game continually since the
nineteenth century. These attractions, these evasions, these
circular incitements have traced around bodies and sexes,
not boundaries not to be crossed, but perpetual spirals of
power and pleasure.
4. Whence those devices ofsexual saturation so character­
istic of the space and the social rituals of the nineteenth
century. People often say that modern society has attempted
to reduce sexuality to the _couple-the heterosexual and, in­
sofar as possible, legitimate couple. There are equal grounds
for saying that it has, if not created, at least outfitted and
made to proliferate, groups with multiple elements and a
circulating sexuality: a distribution of points of power, hier­
archized and placed opposite to one another; "pursued"

46

The History of Sexuality

pleasures, that is, both sought after and searched out; com­
partmental sexualities that are tolerated or encouraged;
proximities that serve as surveillance procedures, and func­
tion as mechanisms of intensification; contacts that operate
as inductors. This is the way things worked in the case of the
family, or rather the household, with parents, children, and
in some instances, servants. Was the nineteenth-century fam­
ily really a monogamic and conjugal cell? Perhaps to a cer­
tain extent. But it was also a network of pleasures and powers
linked together at multiple points and according to trans­
formable relationships. The separation of grown-ups and
children, the polarity established between the parents' bed­
room and that of the children (it became routine in the
course of the century when working-class housing construc­
tion was undertaken), the relative segregation of boys and
girls, the strict instructions as to the care of nursing infants
(maternal breast-feeding, hygiene), the attention focused on
infantile sexuality, the supposed dangers of masturbation,
the importance attached to puberty, the methods of surveil­
lance suggested to parents, the exhortations, secrets, and
fears, the presence-both valued and feared--of servants: all
this made the family, even when brought down to its smallest
dimensions, a complicated network, saturated with multiple,
fragmentary, and mobile sexualities. To reduce them to the
conjugal relationship, and then to project the latter, in the
form of a forbidden desire, onto the children, cannot account
for this apparatus which, in relation to these sexualities, was
less a principle of inhibition than an inciting and multiplying
mechanism. Educational or psychiatric institutions, with
their large populations, their hierarchies, their spatial ar­
rangements, their surveillance systems, constituted, along­
side the family, another way of distributing the interplay of
powers and pleasures; but they too delineated areas of ex. treme sexual saturation, with privileged spaces or rituals
such as the classroom, the dormitory, the visit, and the con­
sultation. The forms of a nonconjugal, nonmonogamous sex­
uality were drawn there and established.

The Repressive Hypothesis

47

Nineteenth-century "bourgeois" society-and it is doubt­
less still with us-was a society of blatant and fragmented
perversion. And this was not by way of hypocrisy, for noth­
ing was more manifest and more prolix, or more manifestly
taken over by discourses and institutions. Not because, hav­
ing tried to erect too rigid or too general a barri�r · against
sexuality, society succeeded only in giving rise to a whole
perverse outbreak and a long pathology of the sexual instinct.
At issue, rather, is the type of power it brought to bear on
the body and on sex. In point of fact, this power had neither
the form of the law, nor the effects of the taboo. On the
contrary, it acted by multiplication of singular sexualities. It
did not set boundaries for sexuality; it extended the various
forms of sexuality, pursuing them according to lines of indefi­
nite penetration. It did not exclude sexuality, but included it
in the body as a mode of specification of individuals. It did
not seek to avoid it; it attracted its varieties by means of
spirals in which pleasure and power reinforced one another.
It did not set up a barrier; it provided places of maximum
saturation. It produced and determined the sexual mosaic.
Modern society is perverse, not in spite of its puritanism or
as if from a backlash provoked by its hypocrisy; it is in actual
fact, and directly, perverse.
In actual fact. The manifold sexualities-those which ap­
pear with the different ages (sexualities of the infant or the
child), those which become fixated on particular tastes or
practices (the sexuality of the invert, the gerontophile, the
fetishist), those which, in a diffuse manner, invest relation­
ships (the sexuality of doctor and patient, teacher and stu­
dent, psychiatrist and mental patient), those which haunt
spaces (the sexuality of the home, the school, the prison)­
all form the correlate of exact procedures of power. We must
not imagine that all these things that were formerly tolerated
attracted notice and received a pejorative designation when
the time came to give a regulative role to the one type of
sexuality that was capable of reproducing labor power and
the form of the family. These polymorphous conducts were

48

The History of Sexuality

actually extracted from people's bodies and from their pleas­
ures; or rather, they were solidified in them; they were drawn
out, revealed, isolated, intensified, incorporated, by mul­
tifarious power devices. The growth of perversions is not a
moralizing theme that obssessed the scrupulous minds of the
Victorians. It is the real product of the encroachment of a
type of power on bodies and their pleasures. It is possible that
the West has not been capable of inventing any new pleas­
ures, and it has doubtless not discovered any original vices.
But it has defined new rules for the game of powers and
pleasures. The frozen countenance of the perversions is a
fixture of this game.
Directly. This implantation of multiple perversions is not
a mockery of sexuality taking revenge on a power that has
thrust on it an excessively repressive law. Neither are we
dealing with'paradoxical forms of pleasure that turn back on
power and invest it in the form of a "pleasure to be endured. "
The implantation of perversions i s an instrument-effect: i t is
through the isolation, intensification, and consolidation of
peripheral sexualities that the relations of power to sex and
pleasure branched out and multiplied, measured the body,
and penetrated modes of conduct. And accompanying this
encroachment of powers, scattered sexualities rigidified, be­
came stuck to an age, a place, a type of practice. A prolifera­
tion of sexualities through the extension of power; an optimi­
zation of the power to which each of these local sexualities
gave a surface of intervention: this concatenation, particu­
larly since the nineteenth century, has been ensured and
relayed by the countless economic interests which, with the
help of medicine, psychiatry, prostitution, and pornography,
have tapped into both this analytical multiplication of pleas­
ure and this optimization of the power that controls it. Pleas­
ure and power do not cancel or turn back against
one another; they seek out, overlap, and reinforce one an­
other. They are linked together by complex mechanisms and
devices of excitation and incitement.

The Repressive Hypothesis

49

We must therefore abandon the hypothesis that modern
industrial societies ushered in an age of increased sexual
repression. We have not only witnessed a visible exp1osion of
unorthodox sexualities; but-and this is the important point
-a deployment quite different from the law, even if it is
locally dependent on procedures of prohibition, has ensured,
through a network of interconnecting mechanisms, the pro­
liferation of specific pleasures and the multiplication of dis­
parate sexualities. It is said that no society has been more
prudish; never have the agencies of power taken such care to
feign ignorance of the thing they prohibited, as if they were
determined to have nothing to do with it. But it is the oppo­
site that has become apparent, at least after a general review
of the facts: never have there existed more centers of power;
never more attention manifested and verbalized; never more
circular contacts and linkages; never more sites where the
intensity of pleasures and the persistency of power catch
hold, only to spread elsewhere.

PART THREE

Scientia Sexua]is

I suppose that the first two points will be granted me; I
imagine that people will accept my saying that, for two cen­
turies now, the discourse on sex has been multiplied rather
than rarefied; and that if it has carried with it taboos and
prohibitions, it has also, in a more fundamental way, ensured
the solidification and implantation of an entire sexual mo­
saic. Yet the impression remains that all this has by and large
played only a defensive role. By speaking about it so much,
by discovering it multiplied, partitioned off, and specified
precisely where one had placed it, what one was seeking
essentially was simply to conceal sex: a screen-discourse, a
dispersion-avoidance. Until Freud at least, the discourse on
sex-the discourse of scholars and theoreticians-never
ceased to hide the thing it was speaking about. We could take
all these things that were said, the painstaking precautions
and detailed analyses, as so many procedures meant to evade
the unbearable, too hazardous truth of sex. And the mere
fact that one claimed to be speaking about it from the rarefied
and neutral viewpoint of a science is in itself significant. This
was in fact a science made up of evasions since, given its
inability or refusal to speak of sex itself, it concerned itself
primarily with aberrations, perversions, exceptional oddities,
pathological abatements, and morbid aggravations. It was by
the same token a science subordinated .in the main to the
imperatives of a morality whose divisions it reiterated under
the guise of the medical norm. Claiming to speak the truth,
it stirred up people's fears; to the least oscillations of sexual­
ity, it ascribed an imaginary dynasty of evils destined to be
passed on for generations; it declared the furtive customs of
the timid, and the moSt solitary of petty manias, dangerous
53

54

The History of Sexuality

for the whole society; strange pleasures, it warned, would
eventually result in nothing short of death: that of individu­
als, generations, the species itself.
It thus became associated with an insistent and indiscreet
medical practice, glibly proclaiming its aversions, quick to
run to the rescue of law and public opinion, more servile with
respect to the powers of order than amenable to the require­
ments of truth. Involuntarily naive in the best of cases, more
often intentionally mendacious, in complicity with what it
denounced, haughty and coquettish, it established an entire
pornography of the morbid, which was characteristic of the
fin de siecle society. In France, doctors like Garnier, Pouillet,
and Ladoucette were its unglorified scribes and Rollinat its
poet. But beyond these troubled pleasures, it assumed other
powers; it set itself up as the supreme authority in matters
of hygienic necessity, taking up the old fears of venereal
affliction and combining them with the new themes of asep­
sis, and the great evolutionist myths with the recent institu­
tions of public health; it claimed to ensure the physical vigor
and the moral cleanliness of the social body; it promised to
eliminate defective individuals, degenerate and bastardized
populations. In the name of a biological and historical ur­
gency, it justified the racisms of the state, which at the time
were on the horizon. It grounded them in "truth."
When we compare these discourses on human sexuality ·
with what was known at the time about the physiology of
animal and plant reproduction, we are struck by the incon­
gruity. Their feeble content from the standpoint of elemen­
tary rationality, not to mention scientificity, earns them a
place apart in the history of knowledge. They form a
strangely muddled zone. Throughout the nineteenth cen­
tury, sex seems to have been incorporated into two very
distinct orders of knowledge: a biology of reproduction,
which developed continuously according to a general scien­
tific normativity, and a medicine of sex conforming to quite
different rules of formation. From one to the other, there was

Scientia Sexualis

55

no real exchange, no reciprocal structuration; the role of the
first with respect to the second was scarcely more than as a
distant and quite fictitious guarantee: a blanket guarantee
under cover of which moral obstacles, economic or political
options, and traditional fears could be recast in a scientific­
sounding vocabulary. It is as if a fundamental resistance
blocked the development of a rationally formed discourse
concerning human sex, its correlations, and its effects. A
disparity of this sort would indicate that the aim of such a
discourse was not to state the truth but to prevent its very
emergence. Underlying the difference between the physiol­
ogy of reproduction and the medical theories of sexuality, we
would have to see something other and something more than
an uneven scientific development or a disparity in the forms
of rationality; the one would partake of that immense will to
knowledge which has sustained the establishment of scien­
tific discourse in the West, whereas the other would derive
from a stubborn will to nonknowledge.
This much is undeniable: the learned discourse on sex that
was pronounced in the nineteenth century was imbued with
age-old delusions, but also with systematic blindnesses: a
refusal to see and to understand; but further-and this is the
crucial point-a refusal concerning the very thing that was
brought to light and whose formulation was urgently solic­
ited. For there can be no misunderstanding that is not based
on a fundamental relation to truth. Evading this truth, bar­
ring access to it, masking it: these were so many local tactics
which, as if by superimposition and through a last-minute
detour, gave a paradoxical form to a fundamental petition to
know. Choosing not to recognize was yet another vagary of
the will to truth. Let Charcot's Salpetriere serve as an exam­
ple in this regard: it was an enormous apparatus for observa­
tion, with its examinations, interrogations, and experiments,
but it was also a machinery for incitement, with its public
presentations, its theater of ritual crises, carefully staged
with the help of ether or amyl nitrate, its interplay of dia-

56

The History of Sexuality

logues, palpations, laying on of hands, postures which the
doctors elicited or obliterated with a gesture or a word, its
hierarchy of personnel who kept watch, organized, pro­
voked, monitored, and reported, and who accumulated an
immense pyramid of observations and dossiers. It is in the
context of this continuous incitement to discourse and to
truth that the real mechanisms of misunderstanding (mecon­
naissance) operated: thus Charcot's gesture interrupting a
public consultation where it began to be too manifestly a
question of "that"; and the more frequent practice of delet­
ing from the succession of dossiers what had been said and
demonstrated by the patients regarding sex, but also what
had been seen, provoked, solicited by the doctors themselves,
things that were almost entirely omitted from the published
observations.l The important thing, in this affair, is not that
these men shut their eyes or stopped their ears, or that they
were mistaken; it is rather that they constructed around and
apropos of sex an immense apparatus for producing truth,
even if this truth was to be masked at the last moment. The
essential point is that sex was not only a matter of sensation
and pleasure, of law and taboo, but also of truth and false­
hood, that the truth of sex became something fundamental,
useful, or dangerous, precious or formidable: in short, that
sex was constituted as a problem of truth. What needs to be
situated, therefore, is not the threshold of a new rationality
whose discovery was marked by Freud-or someone else­
but the progressive formation (and also the transformations)
lCf. . for example, Desire Bourneville, lconographie photographique de fa Safperriere
(1878-1881), pp. 110 If. The unpublished documents dealing with the lessons of
Charcot, which can still be found at the Salpetriere, are again more explicit on this
point than the published texts. The interplay of incitement and elision is clearly
evident in them. A handwritten note gives an account of the session of November
25, 1877. The subject exhibits hysterical spasms; Charcot suspends an attack by
placing first his hand, then the end of a baton, on the woman's ovaries. He with­
draws the baton, and there is a fresh attack, which he accelerates by administering
inhalations of amyl nitrate. The afflicted woman then cries out for the sex-baton in
words that are devoid of any metaphor: "G. is taken away and her delirium
continues. "

of that "interplay of truth and sex" which was bequeathed
to us by the nineteenth century, and which we may have
modified, but, lacking evidence to the contrary, have not rid
ourselves of. Misunderstandings, avoidances, and evasions
were only possible, and only had their effects, against the
background of this strange endeavor: to tell the truth of sex.
An endeavor that does not date from the nineteenth century,
even if it was then that a nascent science lent it a singular
form. It was the basis of all the aberrant, naive, and cunning
discourses where knowledge of sex seems to have strayed for
such a long time.
Historically, there have been two great procedures for
producing the truth of sex.
On the one hand, the societies-and they are numerous:
China, Japan, India, Rome, the Arabo-Moslem societies­
which endowed themselves with an ars erotica. In the erotic
art, truth is drawn from pleasure itself, understood as a
practice and accumulated as experience; pleasure is not con­
sidered in relation to an absolute law of the permitted and
the forbidden, nor by reference to a criterion of utility, but
first and foremost in relation to itself; it is experienced as
pleasure, evaluated in terms of its intensity, its specific qual­
ity, its duration, its reverberations in the body and the soul.
Moreover, this knowledge must be deflected back into the
sexual practice itself, in order to shape it as though from
within and amplify its effects. In this way, there is formed a
knowledge that must remain secret, not because of an ele­
ment of infamy that might attach to its object, but because
of the need to hold it in the greatest reserve, since, according
to tradition, it would lose its effectiveness and its virtue by
being divulged. Consequently, the relationship to the master
who holds the secrets is of paramount importance; only he,
working alone, can transmit this art in an esoteric manner
and as the culmination of an initiation in which he guides the
disciple's progress with unfailing skill and sev�rity. The

58

effects of this masterful art, which are considerably more
generous than the spareness of its prescriptions would lead
one to imagine, are said to transfigure the one fortunate
enough to receive its privileges: an absolute mastery of the
body, a singular bliss, obliviousness to time and limits, the
elixir of life, the exile of death and its threats.
On the face of it at least, our civilization possesses no ars
erotica. In return, it is undoubtedly the only civilization to
practice a scientia sexualis; or rather, the only civilization to
have developed over the centuries procedures for telling the
truth of sex which are geared to a form of knowledge-power
strictly opposed to the art of initiations and the masterful
secret: I have in mind the confession.
Since the Middle Ages at least, Western societies have
established the confession as one of the main rituals we rely
on for the production of truth: the codification of the sacra­
ment of penance by the Lateran Council in 1215, with the
resulting development of confessional techniques, the declin­
ing importance of accusatory procedures in criminal justice,
the abandonment of tests of guilt (sworn statements, duels,
judgments of God) and the development of methods of inter­
rogation and inquest, the increased participation of the royal
administration in the prosecution of infractions, at the ex­
pense of proceedings leading to private settlements, the set­
ting up of tribunals of Inquisition: all this helped to give the
confession a central role in the order of civil and religious
powers. The evolution of the word avowal and of the legal
function it designated is itself emblematic of this develop­
ment: from being a guarantee of the status, identity, and
value granted to one person by another, it came to signify
someone's acknowledgment of his own actions and thoughts.
For a long time, the individual was vouched for by the refer­
ence of others and the demonstration of his ties to the com­
monweal (family, allegiance, protection); then he was
authenticated by the discourse of truth he was able or obliged
to pronounce concerning himself. The truthful confession

Scientia Sexualis

59

was inscribed at the heart of the procedures of individualiza­
tion by power.
In any case, next to the testing rituals, next to the testi­
mony of witnesses, and the learned methods of observation
and demonstration, the confession became one of the West's
most highly valued techniques for producing truth. We have
since become a singularly confessing society. The confession
has spread its effects far and wide. It plays a part in justice,
medicine, education, family relationships, and love relations,
in the most ordinary affairs of everyday life, and in the most
solemn rites; one confesses one's crimes, one's sins, one's
thoughts and desires, one's illnesses and troubles; one goes
about telling, with the greatest precision, whatever is most
difficult to tell. One confesses in public and in private, to
one's parents, one's educators, one's doctor, to those one
loves; one admits to oneself, in pleasure and in pain, things
it would be impossible to tell to anyone else, the things people
write books about. One confesses-or is forced to confess.
When it is not spontaneous or dictated by some internal
imperative, the confession is wrung from a person by vio­
lence or threat; it is driven from its hiding place in the soul,
or extracted from the body. Since the Middle Ages, torture
has accompanied it like a shadow, and supported it when it
could go no further: the dark twins.2 The most defenseless
tenderness 'and the bloodiest of powers have a similar need
of confession. Western man has become a confessing animal.
Whence a metamorphosis in literature: we have passed
from a pleasure to be recounted and heard, centering on the
heroic or marvelous narration of "trials" of bravery or saint­
hood, to a literature ordered according to the infinite task of
extracting from the depths of oneself, in between the words,
a truth which the very form of the confession holds out like
a shimmering mirage. Whence too this new way of philo­
sophizing: seeking the fundamental relation to the true, not
'Greek law had already coupled torture and confession, at least where slaves were
concerned, and Imperial Roman law had widened the practice.

60

The History of Sexuality

simply in oneself-in some forgotten knowledge, or in a
certain primal trace-but in the self-examination that yields,
through a multitude of fleeting impressions, the basic cer­
tainties of consciousness. The obligation to confess is now
relayed through so many different points, 'is so deeply in­
grained in us, that we no longer perceive it as the effect of
a power that constrains us; on the contrary, it seems to us
that truth, lodged in our most secret nature, "demands" only
to surface; that if it fails to do so, this is because a constraint
holds it in place, the violence of a power weighs it down, and
it can finally be articulated only at the price of a kind of
liberation. Confession frees, but power reduces one to si­
lence; truth does not belong to the order of power, but shares
an original affinity with freedom: traditional themes in phi­
losophy, which a "political history of truth" would have to
overturn by showing that truth is not by nature free-nor
error servile-but that its production is thoroughly imbued
with relations of power. The confession is an example of this.
One has to be completely taken in by this internal ruse of
confession in order to attribute a fundamental role to censor­
ship, to taboos regarding speaking and thinking; one has to
have an inverted image of power in order to believe that all
these voices which have spoken so long in our civilization­
repeating the formidable injunction to tell what one is and
what one does, what one recollects and what one has forgot­
ten, what one is thinking and what one thinks he is not
thinking-are speaking to us of freedom. An immense labor
to which the West has submitted generations in order to
produce-while other forms of work ensured the accumula­
tion of capital-men's subjection: their constitution as sub­
jects in both senses of the word. Imagine how exorbitant
must have seemed the order given to all Christians at the
beginning of the thirteenth century, to kneel at least once a
year and confess to all their transgressions, without omitting
a single one. And think of that obscure partisan, seven centu­
ries later, who had come to rejoin the Serbian resistance deep

Scientia Sexualis

61

in the mountains; his superiors asked him to write his life
story; and when he brought them a few miserable pages,
scribbled in the night, they did not look at them but only said
to him, "Start over, and tell the truth." Should those much­
discussed language taboos make us forget this millennial
yoke of confession?
From the Christian penance to the present day, sex was a
privileged theme of confession. A thing that was hidden, we
are told. But what if, on the contrary, it was what, in a quite
particular way, one confessed? Suppose the obligation to
conceal it was but another aspect of the duty to admit to it
(concealing it all the more and with greater care as the
confession of it was more important, requiring a stricter
ritual and promising more decisive effects)? What if sex in
our society, on a scale of several centuries, was something
that was placed within an unrelenting system of confession?
The transformation of sex into discourse, which I spoke of
earlier, the dissemination and reinforcement of heterogene­
ous sexualities, are perhaps two elements of the same deploy­
ment: they are linked together with the help of the central
element of a confession that compels individuals to articulate
their sexual peculiarity-no matter how extreme. In Greece,
truth and sex were linked, in the form of pedagogy, by the
transmission of a precious knowledge from one body to an­
other; sex served as a medium for initiations into learning.
For us, it is in the confession that truth and sex are joined,
through the obligatory and exhaustive expression of an indi­
vidual secret. But this time it is truth that serves as a medium
for sex and its manifestations.
The confession is a ritual of discourse in which the speak­
ing subject is also the subject of the statement; it is also a
ritual that unfolds within a power relationship, for one does
not confess without the presence (or virtual presence) of a
partner who is not simply the interlocutor but the authority
who requires the confession, prescribes and appreciates it,
and intervenes in order to judge, punish, forgive, console,

62

The History of Sexuality

and reconcile; a ritual in which the truth is corroborated by
the obstacles and resistances it has had to surmount in order
to be formulated; and finally, a ritual in which the expression
alone, independently of its external consequences, produces
intrinsic modifications in the person who articulates it: it
exonerates, redeems, and purifies him; it unburdens him of
his wrongs, liberates him, and promises him salvation. For
centuries, the truth of sex was, at least for the most part,
caught up in this discursive form. Moreover, this form was
not the same as that of education (sexual education confined
itself to general principles and rules of prudence); nor was it
that of initiation (which remained essentially a silent prac­
tice, which the act of sexual enlightenment or deflowering
merely rendered laughable or violent). As we have seen, it is
a form that is far removed from the one governing the "erotic
art." By virtue of the power structure immanent in it, the
confessional discourse cannot come from above, as in the ars
erotica, through the sovereign will of a master, but rather
from below, as an obligatory act of speech which, under some
imperious compulsion, breaks the bonds of discretion or for­
getfulness. What secrecy it presupposes is not owing to the
high price of what it has to say and the small number of those
who are worthy of its benefits, but to its obscure familiarity
and it§ general baseness. Its veracity is not guaranteed by the
lofty authority of the magistery, nor by the tradition it trans­
mits, but by the bond, the basic intimacy in discourse, be­
tween the dne who speaks and what he is speaking about. On
the other hand, the agency of domination does not reside in
the one who speaks (for it is he who is constrained), but in
the one who listens and says nothing; not in the one who
knows and answers, but in the one who questions and is not
supposed to know. And this discourse of truth finally takes
effect, not in the one who receives it, but in the one from
whom it is wrested. With these confessed truths, we are a
long way from the learned initiations into pleasure, with
their technique and their mystery. On the other hand, we

Scien tia Sexualis

63

belong to a society which has ordered sex's difficult knowl­
edge, not according to the transmission of secrets, but
around the slow surfacing of confidential statements.
The confession was, and still remains, the general standard
governing the production of the true discourse on sex. It has
undergone a considerable transformation, however. For a
long time, it remained firmly entrenched in the practice of
penance. But with the rise of Protestantism, the Counter
Reformation, eighteenth-century pedagogy, and nineteenth­
century medicine, it gradually lost its ritualistic and exclu­
sive localization; it spread; it has been employed in a whole
series of relationships: children and parents, students and
educators, patients and psychiatrists, delinquents and ex­
perts. The motivations and effects it is expected to produce
have varied, as have the forms it has taken: interrogations,
consultations, autobiographical narratives, letters; they have
been recorded, transcribed, assembled into dossiers, pub­
lished, and commented on. But more important, the confes­
sion lends itself, if not to other domains, at least to new ways
of exploring the existing ones. It is no longer a question
simply of saying what was done-the sexual act-and how
it was done; but of reconstructing, in and around the act, the
thoughts that recapitulated it, the obsessions that accom­
panied it, the images, desires, modulations, and quality of the
pleasure that animated it. For the first time no doubt, a
society has taken upon itself to solicit and hear the imparting
of individual pleasures.
A dissemination, then, of procedures of confession, a mul­
tiple localization of their constraint, a widening of their do­
main: a great archive of the pleasures of sex was gradually
constituted. For a long time this archive dematerialized as it
was formed. It regularly disappeared without a trace (thus
suiting the purposes of the Christian pastoral) until medi­
cine, psychiatry, and pedagogy began to solidify it: Campe,
Salzmann, and especially Kaan, Krafft-Ebing, Tardieu,
Molle, and Havelock Ellis carefully assembled this whole

64

The History of Sexuality

pitiful, lyrical outpouring from the sexual mosaic. Western
societies thus began to keep an indefinite record of these
people's pleasures. They made up a herbal of them and estab­
lished a system of classification. They described their every­
day deficiencies as well as their oddities or exasperations.
This was an important time. It is easy to make light of these
nineteenth-century psychiatrists, who made a point of apolo­
gizing for the horrors they were about to let speak, evoking
"immoral behavior" or "aberrations of the genetic senses,"
but I am more inclined to applaud their seriousness: they had
a feeling for momentous events. It was a time when the most
singular pleasures were called upon to pronounce a discourse
of truth concerning themselves, a discourse which had to
model itself after that which spoke, not of sin and salvation,
but of bodies and life processes-the discourse of science. It
was enough to make one's voice tremble, for an improbable
thing was then taking shape: a confessional science, a science
which relied on a many-sided extortion, and took for its
object what was unmentionable but admitted to nonetheless.
The scientific discourse was scandalized, or in any case re­
pelled, w�en it had to take charge of this whole discourse
from below. It was also faced with a theoretical and method­
ological paradox: the long discussions concerning the possi­
bility of constituting a science of the subject, the validity of
introspection, lived experience as evidence, or the presence
of consciousness to itself were responses to this problem that
is inherent in the functioning of truth in our society: can one
articulate the production of truth according to the old juridi­
co-religious model of confession, and the extortion of confi­
dential evidence according to the rules of scientific discourse?
Those who believe that sex was more rigorously elided in the
nineteenth century than ever before, through a formidable
mechanism of blockage and a deficiency of discourse, can say
what they please. There was no deficiency, but rather an
excess, a redoubling, too much rather than not enough dis­
course, in any case an interference between two modes of

Scientia Sexualis

65

production of truth: procedures of confession, and scientific
discursivity.
And instead of adding up the errors, naivetes, and moral­
isms that plagued the nineteenth-century discourse of truth
concerning sex, we would do better to locate the procedures
by which that will to knowledge regarding sex, which cha­
racterizes the modern Occident, caused the rituals of confes­
sion to function within the norms of scientific regularity: how
did this immense and traditional extortion of the sexual con­
fession come to be constituted in scientific terms?
1 . Through a clinical codification of the inducement to
speak. Combining confession with examination, the personal
history with the deployment of a set of decipherable signs
and symptoms; the interrogation, the exacting questionnaire,
and hypnosis, with the recollection of memories and free
association: all were ways of reinscribing the procedure of
confession in a field of scientifically acceptable observations.

2. Through the postulate of a general and diffuse causality.
Having to tell everything, being able to pose questions about
everything, found their justification in the principle that en­
dowed sex with an inexhaustible and polymorphous causal
power. The most discrete event in one's sexual behavior­
whether an accident or a deviation, a deficit or an excess­
was deemed capable of entailing the most varied conse­
quences throughout one's existence; there was scarcely a
malady or physical disturbance to which the nineteenth cen­
tury did not impute at least some degree of sexual etiology.
From the bad habits of children to the phthises of adults, the
apoplexies of old people, nervous maladies, and the degener­
ations of the race, the medicine of that era wove an entire
network of sexual causality to explain them. This may well
appear fantastic to us, but the principle of sex as a "cause of
any and everything" was the theoretical underside of a con­
fession that had to be thorough, meticulous, and constant,

66

The History of Sexuality

and at the same time operate within a scientific type of
practice. The limitless dangers that sex carried with it jus­
tified the exhaustive character of the inquisition to which it
was subjected.

3. Through the principle of a latency intrinsic to sexuality.
If it was necessary to extract the truth of sex through the
technique of confession, this was not simply because it was
difficult to tell, or stricken by the taboos of decency, but
because the ways of sex were obscure; it was elusive by
nature; its energy and its mechanisms escaped observation,
and its causal power was partly clandestine. By integrating
it into the beginnings of a scientific discourse, the nineteenth
century altered the scope of the confession; it tended no
longer to be concerned solely with what the subject wished
to hide, but with what was hidden from himself, being inca­
pable of coming to light except gradually and through the
labor of a confession in which the questioner and the ques­
tioned each had a part to play. The principle of a latency
essential to sexuality made it possible to link the forcing of
a difficult confession to a scientific practice. It had to be
exacted, by force, since it involved something that tried to
stay hidden.
Through the method of interpretation. If one had to
confess, this was not merely because the person to whom one
confessed had the power to forgive, console, and direct, but
because the work of producing the truth was obliged to pass
through this relationship if it was to be scientifically vali­
dated. The truth did not reside solely in the subject who, by
confessing, would reveal it wholly formed. It was constituted
in two stages: present but incomplete, blind to itself, in the
one who spoke, it could only reach completion in the one
who assimilated and recorded it. It was the latter's function
to verify this obscure truth: the revelation of confession had
to be coupled with the decipherment of what it said. The one
4.

Scientia Sexualis

67

who listened was not simply the forgiving master, the judge
who condemned or acquitted; he was the master of truth. His
was a hermaneutic function. With regard to the confession,
his power was not only to demand it before it was made, or
decide what was to follow after it, but also to constitute a
discourse of truth on the basis of its decipherment. By no
longer making the confession a test, but rather a sign, and by
making sexuality something to be interpreted, the nineteenth
century gave itself the possibility of causing the procedures
of confession to operate within the regular formation of a
scientific discourse.
5. Through the medicalization of the effects of confession.

The obtaining of the confession and its effects were recodified
as therapeutic operations. Which meant first of all that the
sexual domain was no longer accounted for simply by the
notions of error or sin, excess or transgression, but was
placed under the rule of the normal and the pathological
(which, for that matter, were the transposition of the former
categories); a characteristic sexual morbidity was defined for
the first time; sex appeared as an extremely unstable patho­
logical field: a surface of repercussion for other ailments, but
also the focus of a specific nosography, that of instincts,
tendencies, images, pleasure, and conduct. This implied fur­
thermore that sex would derive its meaning and its necessity
from medical interventions: it would be required by the doc­
tor, necessary for diagnosis, and effective by nature in the
cure. Spoken in time, to the proper party, and by the person
who was both the bearer of it and the one responsible for it,
the truth healed.
Let us consider things in broad historical perspective:
breaking with the traditions of the ars erotica, our society has
equipped itself with a scientia sex ua lis. To be more precise,
.
it has pursued the task of producing true discourses concern­
ing sex, and this by adapting-not without difficulty-the

68

The History of Sexuality

ancient procedure of confession to the rules of scientific dis­
course. Paradoxically, the scientia sexualis that emerged in
the nineteenth century kept as its nucleus the singular ritual
of obligatory and exhaustive confession, which in the Chris­
tian West was the first technique for producing the truth of
sex. Beginning in the sixteenth century, this rite gradually
detached itself from the sacrament of penance, and via the
guidance of souls and the direction of conscience-the ars
artium-emigrated toward pedagogy, relationships between
adults and children, family relations, medicine, and psychia­
try. In any case, nearly one hundred and fifty years have gone
into the making of a complex machinery for producing true
discourses on sex: a deployment that spans a wide segment
of history in that it connects the ancient injunction of confes­
sion to clinical listening methods. It is this deployment that
enables something called "sexuality" to embody the truth of
sex and its pleasures.
"Sexuality" : the correlative of that slowly developed dis­
cursive practice which constitutes the scientia sexualis. The
essential features of this sexuality are not the expression of
a representation that is more or less distorted by ideology, or
of a misunderstanding caused by taboos; they correspond to
the functional requirements of a discourse that must produce
its truth. Situated at the point of intersection of a technique
of confession and a scientific discursivity, where certain
major mechanisms had to be found for adapting them to one
another (the listening technique, the postulate of causality,
the principle of latency, the rule of interpretation, the imper­
ative of medicalization), sexuality was defined as being "by
nature" : a domain susceptible to pathological processes, and
hence one calling for therapeutic or normalizing interven­
tions; a field of meanings to decipher; the site of processes
concealed by specific mechanisms; a focus of indefinite causal
relations; and an obscure speech (parole) that had to be
ferreted out and listened to. The "economy" of discourses­
their intrinsic technology, the necessities of their operation,

Scientia Sexuahs

69

the tactics they employ, the effects of power which underlie
them and which they transmit-this, and not a system of
representations, is what determines the essential features of
what they have to say. The history of sexuality-that is, the
history of what functioned in the nineteenth century as a
specific field of truth-must first be written from the view­
point of a history of discourses.
Let us put forward a general working hypothesis. The
society that emerged in the nineteenth century-bourgeois,
capitalist, or industrial society, call it what you will-did not
confront sex with a fundamental refusal of recognition. On
the contrary, it put into operation an entire machinery for
producing true discourses concerning it. Not only did it
speak of sex and compel everyone to do so; it also set out to
formulate the uniform truth of sex. As if it suspected sex of
harboring a fundamental secret. As if it needed this produc­
tion of truth. As if it was essential that sex be inscribed not
only in an economy of pleasure but in an ordered system of
knowledge. Thus sex gradually became an object of great
suspicion; the general and disquieting meaning that pervades
our conduct and our existence, in spite of ourselves; the point
of weakness where evil portents reach through to us; the
fragment of darkness that we each carry within us: a general
signification, a universal secret, an omnipresent cause, a fear
that never ends. And so, in this "question" of sex (in both
senses: as interrogation and problematization, and as the
need for confession and integration into a field of rationality),
two processes emerge, the one always conditioning the other:
we demand that sex speak the truth (but, since it is the secret
and is oblivious to its own nature, we reserve for ourselves
the function of telling the truth of its truth, revealed and
deciphered at last), and we demand that it tell us our truth,
or rather, the deeply buried truth of that truth about our­
selves which we think we possess in our immediate con­
sciousness. We tell it its truth by deciphering what it tells us
about that truth; it tells us our own by delivering up that part

70

The History of Sexuality

of it that escaped us. From this interplay there has evolved,
over several centuries, a knowledge of the subject; a knowl­
edge not so much of his form, but of that which divides him,
determines him perhaps, but above all causes him to be
ignorant of himself. As unlikely as this may seem, it should
not surprise us when we think of the long history of the
Christian and juridical confession, of the shifts and transfor­
mations this form of knowledge-power, so important in the
West, has undergone: the project of a science of the subject
has gravitated, in ever narrowing circles, around the question
of sex. Causality in the subject, the unconscious of the sub­
ject, the truth of the subject in the other who knows, the
knowledge he holds unbeknown to him, all this found an
opportunity to deploy itself in the discourse of sex. Not,
however, by reason of some natural property inherent in sex
itself, but by virtue of the tactics of power immanent in this
discourse.

Scientia sexualis versus ars erotica, no doubt. But it should
be noted that the ars erotica did not disappear altogether
from Western civilization; nor has it always been absent from
the movement by which one sought to produce a science of
sexuality. In the Christian confession, but especially in the
direction and examination of conscience, in the search for
spiritual union and the love of God, there was a whole series
of methods that had much in common with an erotic art:
guidance by the master along a path of initiation, the inten­
sification of experiences extending down to their physical
components, the optimization of effects by the discourse that
accompanied them. The phenomena of possession and ec­
stasy, which were quite frequent in the Catholicism of the
Counter Reformation, were undoubtedly effects that had got
outside the control of the erotic technique immanent in this
subtle science of the flesh. And we must ask whether, since
the nineteenth century, the scientia sexualis-under the
guise of its decent positivism-has not functioned, at least to

Scientia Sexualis

71

a certain extent, as an ars erotica. Perhaps this production
of truth, intimidated though it was by the scientific model,
multiplied, intensified, and even created its own intrinsic
pleasures. It is often said that we have been incapable of
imagining any new pleasures. We have at least invented a
different kind of pleasure: pleasure in the truth of pleasure,
the pleasure of knowing that truth, of discovering and expos­
ing it, the fascination of seeing it and telling it, of captivating
and capturing others by it, of confiding it in secret, of luring
it out in the open-the specific pleasure of the true discourse
on pleasure.
The most important elements of an erotic art linked to our
knowledge about sexuality are not to be sought in the ideal,
promised to us by medicine, of a healthy sexuality, nor in the
humanist dream of a complete and flourishing sexuality, and
certainly not in the lyricism of orgasm and the good feelings
of bio-energy (these are but aspects of its normalizing utiliza­
tion), but in this multiplication and intensification of pleas­
ures connected to the production of the truth about sex. The
learned volumes, written and read; the consultations and
examinations; the anguish of answering questions and the
delights of having one's words interpreted; all the stories told
to oneself and to others, so much curiosity, so many confi­
dences offered in the face of scandal, sustained-but not
without trembling a little-by the obligation of truth; the
profusion of secret fantasies and the dearly paid right to
whisper them to whoever is able to hear them; in short, the
formidable "pleasure of analysis" (in the widest sense of the
latter term) which the West has cleverly been fostering for
several centuries: all this constitutes something like the er­
rant fragments of an erotic art that is secretly transmitted by
confession and the science of sex. Must we conclude that our
scientia sexualis is but an extraordinarily subtle form of ars
erotica, and that it is the Western, sublimated version of that
seemingly lost tradition? Or must we suppose that all these
pleasures are only the by-products of a sexual science, a

72

The History of Sexuality

bonus that compensates for its many stresses and strains?
In any case, the hypothesis of a power of repression ex­
erted by our society on sex for economic reasons appears to
me quite inadequate if we are to explain this whole series of
reinforcements and intensifications that our preliminary in­
quiry has discovered: a proliferation of discourses, carefully
tailored to the requirements of power; the solidification of the
sexual mosaic and the construction of devices capable not
only of isolating it but of stimulating and provoking it, of
forming it into focuses of attention, discourse, and pleasure;
the mandatory production of confessions and the subsequent
establishment of a system of legitimate knowledge and of an
economy of manifold pleasures. We are dealing not nearly so
much with a negative mechanism of exclusion as with the
operation of a subtle network of discourses, special knowl­
edges, pleasures, and powers. At issue is not a movement
bent on pushing rude sex back into some obscure and inac­
cessible region;but on the contrary, a process that spreads
it over the surface of things and bodies, arouses it, draws it
out and bids it speak, implants it in reality and enjoins it to
tell the truth: an entire glittering sexual array, reflected in a
myriad of discourses, the obstination of powers, and the
interplay of knowledge and pleasure.
All this is an illusion, it will be said, a hasty impression
behind which a more discerning gaze will surely discover the
same great machinery of repression. Beyond these few phos­
phorescences, are we not sure to find once more the somber
law that always says no? The answer will have to come out
of a historical inquiry. An inquiry concerning the manner in
which a knowledge of sex has been forming over the last
three centuries; the manner in which the discourses that take
it as their object have multiplied, and the reasons for which
we have come to attach a nearly fabulous price to the truth
they claimed to produce. Perhaps these historical analyses
will end by dissipating what this cursory survey seems to
suggest. But the postulate I started out with, and would like

Scientia Sexualis

73

to hold to as long as possible, is that these deployments of
power and knowledge, of truth and pleasures, so unlike those
of repression, are not necessarily secondary and derivative;
and further, that repression is not in any case fundamental
and overriding. We need to take these mechanisms seriously,
therefore, and reverse the direction of our analysis: rather
than assuming a generally acknowledged repression, and an
ignorance measured against what we are supposed to know,
we must begin with these positive mechanisms, insofar as
they produce knowledge, multiply discourse, induce pleas­
ure, and generate power; we must investigate the conditions
of their emergence and operation, and try to discover how
the related facts of interdiction or concealment are dis­
tributed with respect to them. In short, we must define the
strategies of power that are immanent in this will to knowl­
edge. As far as sexuality is concerned, we shall attempt to
constitute the "political economy" of a will to knowledge.

The aim of this series of studies? To transcribe into history
the fable of Les Bijoux indiscrets.
Among its many emblems, our society wears that of the
talking sex. The sex which one c�tches unawares and ques­
tions, and which, restrained and loquacious at the same time,
endlessly replies. One day a certain mechanism, which was
so elfin-like that it could make itself invisible, captured this
sex and, in a game that combined pleasure with compulsion,
and consent with inquisition, made it tell the truth about
itself and others as well. For many years, we have all been
living in the realm of Prince Mangogul: under the spell of an
immense curiosity about sex, bent on questioning it, with an
insatiable desire to hear it speak and be spoken about, quick
to invent all sorts of magical rings that might force it to
abandon its discretion. As if it were essential for us to be able
to draw from that little piece of ourselves not only pleasure
but knowledge, and a whole subtle interchange from one to
the other: a knowledge of pleasure, a pleasu're that comes of
knowing pleasure, a knowledge-pleasure; and as if that fan­
tastic animal we accommodate had itself such finely tuned
ears, such searching eyes, so gifted a tongue and mind, as to
know much and be quite willing to tell it, provided we em­
ployed a little skill in urging it to speak. Between each of us
and our sex, the West has placed a never-ending demand for
truth: it is up to us to extract the truth of sex, since this truth
is beyond its grasp; it is up to sex to tell us our truth, since
sex is what holds it in darkness. But is sex hidden from us,
concealed by a new sense of decency, kept under a bushel by
the grim necessities of bourgeois society? On the contrary, it
shines forth; it is incandescent. Several centuries ago, it was
77

78

The History of Sexuality

placed at the center of a formidable petition to know. A
double petition, in that we are compelled to know how things
are with it, while it is suspected of knowing how things are
with us.
In the space of a few centuries, a certain inclination has
led us to direct the question of what we are, to sex. Not so
much to sex as representing nature, but to sex as history, as
signification and discourse. We have placed ourselves under
the sign of sex, but in the form of a Logic ofSex, rather than
a Physics._ We must make no mistake here: with the great
series of binary oppositions (body/soul, flesh/spirit, instinct!
reason, drives/consciousness) that seemed to refer sex to a
pure mechanics devoid of reason, the West has managed not
only, or not so much, to annex sex to a field of rationality,
which would not be_ all that remarkable an achievement,
seeing how accustomed we are to such "conquests" since the
.Greeks, but to bring us almost entirely-our bodies, our
"minds, our individuality, our history-under the sway of a
�logic of concupiscence and desire. Whenever it is a question
of knowing who we are, it is this logic that henceforth serves
as our master key. It has been several decades since geneti­
cists ceased to conceive of life as an organization strangely
equipped with an additional capacity to reproduce itself; they
see in the reproductive mechanism that very element which
introduces the biological dimension: the matrix not only of
the Ii ving, but of life itself. But it was centuries ago that
countless theoreticians and practitioners of the flesh-whose
approach was hardly "scientific," it is true-made man the
offspring of an imperious and intelligible sex. Sex, the expla­
nation for everything.
It is pointless to �sk: Why then is sex so secret? What is
this force that so long reduced it to silence and has only
recently relaxed its hold somewhat, allowing us to question
it perhaps, but always in the context of and through its
repression? In reality, this question, so often repeated nowa­
days, is but the recent form of a considerable affirmation and

The Deployment of Sexuality

79

a secular prescription: there is where the truth is; go see if
you can uncover it. Acheronto movebo: an age-old decision.
Ye wise men, highly, deeply learned,
Who think it out and know,
How, when, and where do all things pair?
Why do they kiss and love?
Ye men of lofty wisdom, say
What happened to me then;
Search out and tell me where, how, when
And why it happened thus. I

It is reasonable therefore to ask first of all: What is this
injunction? Why this great chase after the truth of sex, the
truth in sex?
In Diderot's tale, the good genie Cucufa discovers at the
bottom of his pocket, in the midst of worthless things­
consecrated seeds, little pagodas made of lead, and moldy
sugar-coated pills-the tiny silver ring whose stone, when
turned, makes the sexes one encounters speak. He gives it to
the curious sultan. Our problem is to know what marvelous
ring confers a similar power on us, and on which master's
finger it has been placed; what game of power it makes
possible or presupposes, and how it is that each one of us has
become a sort of attentive and imprudent sultan with respect
to his own sex and that of others. It is this magical ring, this
jewel which is so indiscreet when it comes to making others
speak, but so ineloquent concerning one's own mechanism,
that we need to render loquacious in its turn; it is what we
have to talk about. We must write the history of this will to
truth, this petition to know that for so many centuries has
kept us enthralled by sex: the history of a stubborn and
relentless effort. What is it that we demand of sex, beyond
its possible pleasures, that makes us so persistent? What is
this patience or eagerness to constitute it as the secret, the
'Gottfried August BUrger, cited by Arthur Schopenhauer in The Metaphysics of the
Love of the Sexes. From The Will to Live: Selected Writings ofArthur Schopenhauer
(New York: Frederick Ungar, 1962), p.69.

omnipotent cause, the hidden meaning, the unremitting fear?
And why was the task of discovering this difficult truth
finally turned into an invitation to eliminate taboos and
break free of what binds us? Was the labor then so arduous
that it had to be enchanted by this promise? Or had this
knowledge become so costly-in political, economic, and
ethical terms-that in order to subject everyone to its rule,
it was necessary to assure them, paradoxically, that their
liberation was at 'stake?
In order to situate the investigations that will follow, let
me put forward some general propositions concerning the
objective, the method, the domain to be covered, and the
periodizations that one can accept in a provisory way.

I
Objective

Why these investigations? I am well aware that an uncer­
tainty runs through the sketches I have drawn thus far, one
that threatens to invalidate the more detailed inquiries that
I have projected. I have repeatedly stressed that the history
of the last centuries in Western societies did not manifest the
movement of a power that was essentially repressive. I based
my argument on the disqualification of that notion while
feigning ignorance of the fact that a critique has been
mounted from another quarter and doubtless in a more radi­
cal fashion: a critique conducted at the level of the theory of
desire. In point of fact, the assertion that sex is not "re­
pressed" is not altogether new. Psychoanalysts have been
saying the same thing for some time. They have challenged
the simple little machinery that comes to mind when one
speaks of repression; the idea of a rebellious energy that must
be throttled has appeared to them inadequate for deciphering
the manner in which power and desire are joined to one
another; they consider them to be linked in a more complex
and primary way than through the interplay of a primitive,
natural, and living energy welling up from below, and a
higher order seeking to stand in its way; thus one should not
think that desire is repressed, for the simple reason that the
law is what constitutes both desire and the lack on which it
is predicated. Where there is desire, the power relation is
already present: an illusion, then, to denounce this relation
81

82

The History of Sexuality

for a repression exerted after the event; but vanity as well,
to go questing after a desire that is beyond the reach of
power.
But, in an obstinately confused way, I sometimes spoke,
as though I were dealing with equivalent notions, of repres­
sion, and sometimes of law, of prohibition or censorship.
Through stubbornness or neglect, I failed to consider every­
thing that can distinguish their theoretical implications. And
I grant that one might justifiably say to me: By constantly
referring to positive technologies of power, you are playing
a double game where you hope to win on all counts; you
confuse your adversaries by appearing to take the weaker
position, and, discussing repression alone, you would have us
believe, wrongly, that you have rid yourself of the problem
of law; and yet you keep the essential practical consequence
of the principle of power-as-Iaw, namely the fact that there
is no escaping from power, that it is always-already present,
constituting that very thing which one attempts to counter
it with. As to the idea of a power-repression, you have re­
tained its most fragile theoretical element, and this in order
to criticize it; you have retained the most sterilizing political
consequence of the idea of power-law, but only in order to
preserve it for your own use.
The aim of the inquiries that will follow is to move less
toward a "theory" of power than toward an "analytics" of
power: that is, toward a definition of the specific domain
formed by relations of power, and toward a determination of
the instruments that will make possible its analysis. How­
ever, it seems to me that this analytics can be constituted
only if it frees itself completely from a certain representation
of power that I would term-it will be seen later why­
"juridico-discursive. " It is this conception that governs both
the thematics of repression and the theory of the law as
constitutive of desire. In other words, what distinguishes the
analysis made in terms of the repression of instincts from
that made in terms of the law of desire is clearly the way in

The Deployment of Sexuality

83

which they each conceive of the nature and dynamics of the
drives, not the way in which they conceive of power. They
both rely on a common representation of power which, de­
pending on the use made of it and the position it is accorded
with respect to desire, leads to two contrary results: either to
the promise of a "liberation," if power is seen as having only
an external hold on desire, or, if it is constitutive of desire
itself, to the affirmation: you are always-already trapped.
Moreover, one must not imagine that this representation is
peculiar to those who are concerned with the problem of the
relations of power with sex. In fact it is much more general;
one frequently encounters it in political analyses of power,
and it is deeply rooted in the history of the West.
These are some of its principal features:

- The negative relation. It never establishes any connec­
tion between power and sex that is not negative: rejection,
exclusion, refusal, blockage, concealment. or mask. Where
sex and pleasure are concerned, power can "do" nothing but
say no to them; what it produces, if anything, is absences and
gaps; it overlooks elements, introduces discontinuities, sepa­
rates what is joined, and marks off boundaries. Its effects take
the general form of limit and lack.
- The insistence of the rule. Power is essentially what
dictates its law to sex. Which means first of all that sex is
placed by power in a binary system: licit and illicit, permitted
and forbidden. Secondly, power prescribes an "order" for sex
that operates at the same time as a form of intelligibility: sex
is to be deciphered on the basis of its relation to the law. And
finally, power acts by laying' down the rule: power's hold on
sex is maintained through language, or rather through the
act of discourse that creates, from the very fact that it is
articulated, a rule of law. It speaks, and that is the rule. The
pure form of power resides in the function of the legislator;
and its mode of action with regard to sex is of a juridico­
discursive character.

84

The History of Sexuality

-The cycle of prohibition: thou shalt not go near, thou
shalt not touch, thou shalt not consume, thou shalt not
experience pleasure, thou shalt not speak, thou shalt not
show thyself; ultimately thou shalt not exist, except in dark­
ness and secrecy. To deal with sex, power employs nothing
more than a law of prohibition. Its objective: that sex re­
nounce itself. Its instrument: the threat of a punishment that
is nothing other than the suppression of sex. Renounce your­
self or suffer the penalty of being suppressed; do not appear
if you do not want to disappear. Your existence will be
maintained only at the cost of your nullification. Power con­
strains sex only through a taboo that plays on the alternative
between two nonexistences.
-The logic of censorship. This interdiction is thought to
take three forms: affirming that such a thing is not permitted,
preventing it from being said, denying that it exists. Forms
that are difficult to reconcile. But it is here that one imagines
a sort of logical sequence that characterizes censorship
mechanisms: it links the inexistent, the illicit, and the inex­
pressible in such a way that each is at the same time the
principle and the effect of the others: one must not talk about
what is forbidden until it is annulled in reality; what is inex­
istent has no right to show itself, even in the order of speech
where its inexistence is declared; and that which one must
keep silent about is banished from reality as the thing that
is tabooed above all else. The logic of power exerted on sex
is the paradoxical logic of a law that might be expressed as
an injunction of nonexistence, nonmanifestation, and silence.
-The uniformity of the apparatus. Power over sex is exer­
cised in the same way at all levels. From top to bottom, in
its over-all decisions . and its capillary interventions alike,
whatever the devices or institutions on which it relies, it acts
in a uniform and comprehensive manner; it operates accord­
ing to the simple and endlessly reproduced mechanisms of
law, taboo, and censorship: from state to family, from prince
to father, from the tribunal to the small change of everyday

The Deployment of Sexuality

85

punishments, from the agencies of social domination to the
structures that constitute the subject himself, one finds a
general form of power, varying in scale alone. This form is
the law of transgression and punishment, with its interplay
of licit and illicit. Whether one attributes to it the form of the
prince who f?rmulates rights, of the father who forbids, of
the censor who enforces silence, or of the master who states
the law, in any case one schematizes power in a juridical
form, and one defines its effects as obedience. Confronted by
a power that is law, the subject who is constituted as subject
-who is "subjected"-is he who obeys. To the formal
homogeneity of power in these various instances corresponds
the general form of submission in the one who is constrained
by it-whether the individual in question is the subject oppo­
site the monarch, the citizen opposite the state, the child
opposite the parent, or the disciple opposite the master. A
legislative power on one side, and an obedient subject on the
other.
Underlying both the general theme that power represses
sex and the idea that the law constitutes desire, one encoun­
ters the same putative mechanics of power. It is defined in
a strangely restrictive way, in that, to begin with, this power
is poor in resources, sparing of its methods, monotonous in
the tactics it utilizes, incapable of invention, and seemingly
doomed always to repeat itself. Further, it is a power that
only has the force of the negative on its side, a power to say
no; in no condition to produce, capable only of posting limits,
it is basically anti-energy. This is the paradox of its effective­
ness: it is incapable of doing anything, except to render what
it dominates incapable of doing anything either, except for
what this power allows it to do. And finally, it is a power
whose model is essentially juridical, centered on nothing
more than the statement of the law and the operation of
taboos. All the modes of domination, submission, and subju­
gation are ultimately reduced to an effect of obedience.

86

The History of Sexuality

Why is this juridical notion of power, involving as it does
the neglect of everything that makes for its productive effec­
tiveness, its strategic resourcefulness, its positivity, so readily
accepted? In a society such as ours, where the devices of
power are so numerous, its rituals so visible, and its instru­
ments ultimately so reliable, in this society that has been
more imaginative, probably, than any other in creating devi­
ous and supple mechanisms of power, what explains this
tendency not to recognize the latter except in the negative
and emaciated form of prohibition? Why are the deploy­
ments of power reduced simply to the procedure of the law
of interdiction?
Let me offer a general and tactical reason that seems self­
evident: power is tolerable only on condition that it mask a
substantial part of itself. Its success is proportional to its
aj)ility to hide its own mechanisms. Would power be ac­
cepted if it were entirely cynical? For it, secrecy is not in the
nature of an abuse; it is indispensable to its operation. Not
only because power imposes secrecy on those whom it domi­
nates, but because it is perhaps just as indispensable to the
latter: would they accept it if they did not see it as a mere
limit placed on their desire, leaving a measure of freedom­
however slight-intact? Power as a pure limit set on freedom
is, at least in our society, the general form of its acceptability.
There is, perhaps, a historical reason for this. The great
institutions of power that developed in the Middle Ages­
monarchy, the state with its apparatus-rose up on the basis
of a multiplicity of prior powers, and to a certain extent in
opposition to them: dense, entangled, conflicting powers,
powers tied to the direct or indirect dominion over the land,
to the possession of arms, to serfdom, to bonds of suzerainty
and vassalage. If these institutions were able to implant
themselves, if, by profiting from a whole series of tactical
alliances, they were able to gain acceptance, this was because
they presented themselves as agencies of regulation, arbitra­
tion, and demarcation, as a way of introducing order in the

The Deployment of Sexuality

87

midst of these powers, of establishing a principle that would
temper them and distribute them according to boundaries
and a. fixed hierarchy. Faced with a myriad of clashing
forces, these great forms of power functioned as a principle
of right that transcended all the heterogeneous claims, mani­
festing the triple distinction of forming a unitary regime, of
identifying its will with the law, and of acting through mech­
anisms of interdiction and sanction. The slogan of this re­
gime, pax etjustitia, in keeping with the function it laid claim
to, established peace as the prohibition of feudal or private
wars, and justice as a way of suspending the private settling
of lawsuits. Doubtless there was more to this development of
great monarchic institutions than a pure and simple juridical
edifice. But such was the language of power, the representa­
tion it gave of itself, and the entire theory of public law that
was constructed in the Middle Ages, or reconstructed from
Roman law, bears witness to the fact. Law was not simply
a weapon skillfully wielded by monarchs; it was the mo­
narchic system's mode of manifestation and the form of its
acceptability. In Western societies since the Middle Ages, the
exercise of power has always been formulated in terms of
law.
A tradition dating back to the eighteenth or nineteenth
century has accustomed us to place absolute monarchic
power on the side of the unlawful: arbitrariness, abuse, ca­
price, willfulness, privileges and exceptions, the traditional
continuance of accomplished facts. But this is to overlook a
fundamental historical trait of Western monarchies: they
were constructed as systems of law, they expressed them­
selves through theories of law, and they made their mech­
anisms of power work in the form of law. The old reproach
that Boulainvilliers directed at the French monarchy-that
it used the law and jurists to do away with rights and to bring
down the aristocracy-was basically warranted by the facts.
Through the development of the monarchy and its institu­
tions this juridico-political dimension was established. It is

88

The History of Sexuality

by no means adequate to describe the manner in which
power was and is exercised, but it is the code according to
which power presents itself and prescribes that we conceive
of it. The history of the monarchy went hand in hand with
the covering up of the facts and procedures of power by
juridico-political discourse.
Yet, despite the efforts that were made to disengage the
juridical sphere from the monarchic institution and to free
the political from the juridical, the representation of power
remained caught within this system. Consider the two fol­
lowing examples. Criticism of the eighteenth-century mo­
narchic institution in France was not directed against the
juridico-monarchic sphere as such, but was made on behalf
of a pure and rigorous juridical system to which all the
mechanisms of power could conform, with no excesses or
irregularities, as opposed to a monarchy which, notwith­
standing its own assertions, continuously overstepped the
legal framework and set itself above the laws. Political criti­
cism availed itself, therefore, of all the juridical thinking that
had accompanied the development of the monarchy, in order
to condemn the latter; but it did not challenge the principle
which held that law had to be the very form of power, and
that power always had to be exercised in the form of law.
Another type of criticism of political institutions appeared in
the nineteenth century, a much more radical criticism in that
it was concerned to show not only that real power escaped
the rules ofjurisprudence, but that the legal system itself was
merely a way of exerting violence, of appropriating that
violence for the benefit of the few, and of exploiting the
dissymmetries and injustices of domination under cover of
general law. But this critique of law is still carried out on the
assumption that, ideally and by nature, power must be exer­
cised in accordance with a fundamental lawfulness.
At bottom, despite the differences in epochs 3.nd objec­
tives, the representation of power has remained under the
spell of monarchy. In political thought and analysis, we still

The Deployment of Sexuality

89

have not cut off the head of the king. Hence the importance
that the theory of power gives to the problem of right and
violence, law and illegality, freedom and will, and especially
the state and sovereignty (even if the latter is questioned
insofar as it is personified in a collective being and no longer
a sovereign individual). To conceive of power on the basis of
·
these problems is to conceive of it in terms of a historical
form that is characteristic of our societies: the juridical mon­
archy. Characteristic yet transitory. For while many of its
forms have persisted to the present, it has gradually been
penetrated by quite new mechanisms of power that are prob­
ably irreducible to the representation of law. As we shall see,
these power mechanisms are, at least in part, those that,
beginning in the eighteenth century, took charge of men's
existence, men as living bodies. And if it is true that the
juridical system was useful for representing, albeit in a
nonexhaustive way, a power that was centered primarily
around deduction (prelevement) and death, it is utterly in­
congruous with the new methods of power whose operation
is not ensured by right but by technique, not by law but by
normalization, not by punishment but by control, methods
that are employed on all levels and in forms that go beyond
the state and its apparatus. We have been engaged for centu­
ries in a type of society in which the juridical is increasingly
incapable of coding power, of serving as its system of repre­
sentation. Our historical gradient carries us further and fur­
ther away from a reign of law that had already begun to
recede into the past at a time when the French Revolution
and the accompanying age of constitutions and codes seemed
to destine it for a future that was at hand.
It is this juridical representation that is still at work in
recent analyses concerning the relationships of power to sex.
But the problem is not to know whether desire is alien to
power, whether it is prior to the law as is often thought to
be the case, when it is not rather the law that is perceived as
constituting it. This question is beside the point. Whether

90

The History of Sexuality

desire is this or that, in any case one continues to conceive
of it in relation to a power that is always juridical and discur­
sive, a power that has its central point in the enunciation of
the law. One remains attached to a certain image of power­
law, of power-sovereignty, which was traced out by the
theoreticians of right and the monarchic institution. It is this
image that we must break free of, that is, of the theoretical
privilege of law and sovereignty, if we wish to analyze power
within the concrete and historical framework of its opera­
tion. We must construct an analytics of power that no longer
takes law as a model and a code.
This history of sexuality, or rather this series of studies
concerning the historical relationships of power and the dis­
course on sex, is, I realize, a circular project in the sense that
it involves two endeavors that refer back to one another. We
shall try to rid ourselves of a juridical and negative represen­
tation of power, and cease to conceive of it in terms of law,
prohibition, liberty, and sovereignty. But how then do we
analyze what has occurred in recent history with regard to
this thing-seemingly one of the most forbidden areas of our
lives and bodies-that is sex? How, if not by way of prohibi­
tion and blockage, does power gain access to it? Through
which mechanisms, or tactics, or devices? But let us assume
in turn that a somewhat careful scrutiny will show that
power in modern societies has not in fact governed sexuality
through law and sovereignty; let us suppose that historical
analysis has revealed the presence of a veritable "technol­
ogy" of sex, one that is much more complex and above all
much more positive than the mere effect of a "defense" could
be; this being the case, does this example-which can only
be considered a privileged one, since power seemed in this
instance, more than anywhere else, to function as prohibition
-not compel one to discover principles for analyzing power
which do not derive from the system of right and the form
of law? Hence it is a question of forming a different grid of
historical decipherment by starting from a different theory of

The Deployment of Sexuality

91

power; and, at the same time, of advancing little by little
toward a different conception of power through a closer
examination of an entire historical material. We must at the
same time conceive of sex without the law, and power with­
out the king.

2
Method

Hence the objective is to analyze a certain form of knowl­
edge regarding sex, not in terms of repression or law, but in
terms of power. But the word power is apt to lead to a
number of misunderstandings-misunderstandings with re­
spect to its nature, its form, and its unity. By power, I do not
mean "Power" as a group of institutions and mechanisms
that ensure the subservience of the citizens of a given state.
By power, I do not mean, either, a mode of subjugation
which, in contrast to violence, has the form of the rule.
Finally, I do not have in mind a general system of domi­
nation exerted by one group over another, a system whose
effects, through successive derivations, pervade the entire
social body. The analysis, made in terms of power, must not
assume that the sovereignty of the state, the form of the law,
or the over-all unity of a domination are given at the outset;
rather, these are only the terminal forms power takes. It
seems to me that power must be understood in the first
instance as the multiplicity of force relations immanent in the
sphere in which they operate and which constitute their own
organization; as the process which, through ceaseless strug­
gles and confrontations, transforms, strengthens, or reverses
them; as the support which these force relations find in one
another, thus forming a chain or a system, or on the con­
trary, the disjunctions and contradictions which isolate them
from one another; and lastly, as the strategies in which they
92

The Deployment of Sexuality

93

take effect, whose general design or institutional crystalliza­
tion is embodied in the state apparatus, in the formulation
of the law, in the various social hegemonies. Power's condi­
tion of possibility, or in any case the viewpoint which permits
one to understand its exercise, even in its more "peripheral"
effects, and which also makes it possible to use its mech­
anisms as a grid of intelligibility of the social order, must not
be sought in the primary existence of a central point, in a
unique source of sovereignty from which secondary and de­
scendent forms would emanate; it is the moving substrate of
force relations which, by virtue of their inequality, constantly
engender states of power, but the latter are always local and
unstable. The omnipresence of power: not because it has the
privilege of consolidating everything under its invincible
unity, but because it is produced from one moment to the
next, at every point, or rather in every relation from one
point to another. Power is everywhere; not because it em­
braces everything, but because it comes from everywhere.
And "Power," insofar as it is permanent, repetitious, inert,
and self-reproducing, is simply the over-all effect that
emerges from all these mobilities, the concatenation that
rests on each of them and seeks in turn to arrest their move­
ment. One needs to be nominalistic, no doubt: power is not
an institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain
strength we are endowed with; it is the name that one attrib­
utes to a complex strategical situation in a particular society.
Should we turn the expression around, then, and say that
politics is war pursued by other means? If we still wish to
maintain a separation between war and politics, perhaps we
should postulate rather that this multiplicity of force rela­
tions can be coded-in part but never totally-either in the
form of "war," or in the form of "politics"; this would imply
two different strategies (but the one always liable to switch
into the other) for integrating these unbalanced, heterogene­
ous, unstable, and tense force relations.

94

The History of Sexuality

Continuing this line of discussion, we can advance a cer­
tain number of propositions:
-Power is not something that is acquired, seized, or shared,
something that one holds on to or allows to slip away;
power is exercised from innumerable points, in the inter­
play of nonegalitarian and mobile relations.
-Relations of power are not in a position of exteriority with
respect to other types of relationships (economic proc­
esses, knowledge relationships, sexual relations), but are
immanent in the latter; they are the immediate effects of
the divisions, inequalities, and disequilibriums which
occur in the latter, and conversely they are the internal
conditions of these differentiations; relations of power are
not in superstructural positions, with merely a role of
prohibition or accompaniment; they have a directly pro­
ductive role, wherever they come into play.
-Power comes from below; that is, there is no binary and
all-encompassing opposition between rulers and ruled at
the root of power relations, and serving as a general matrix
-no such duality extending from the top down and react­
ing on more and more limited groups to the very depths
of the social body. One must suppose rather that the mani­
fold relationships of force that take shape and come into
play in the machinery of production, in families, limited
groups, and institutions, are the basis for wide-ranging
effects of cleavage that run through the social body as a
whole. These then form a general line of force that trav­
erses the local oppositions and links them together; to be
sure, they also bring about redistributions, realignments,
homogenizations, serial arrangements, and convergences
of the force relations. Major dominations are the hege­
monic effects that are .sustained by all these confronta­
tions.
-Power relations are both intentional and nonsubjective. If
in fact they are intelligible, this is not because they are the

The Deployment of Sexuality

95

effect of another instance that "explains" them, but rather
because they are imbued, through and through, with cal­
culation: there is no power that is exercised without a
series of aims and objectives. But this does not mean that
it results from the choice or decision of an individual
subject; let us not look for the headquarters that presides
over its rationality; neither the caste which governs, nor
the groups which control the state apparatus, nor those
who make the most important economic decisions direct
the entire network of power that functions in a society
(and makes it function); the rationality of power is charac­
terized by tactics that are often quite explicit at the re­
stricted level where they are inscribed (the local cynicism
of power), tactics which, becoming connected to one an­
other, attracting and propagating one another, but finding
their base of support and their condition elsewhere, end by
forming comprehensive systems: the logic is perfectly
clear, the aims decipherable, and yet it is often the case
that no one is there to have invented them, and few who
can be said to have formulated them: an implicit charac­
teristic of the great anonymous, almost unspoken strate­
gies which coordinate the loquacious tactics whose "in­
ventors" or decisionmakers are often without hypocrisy.
-Where there is power, there is resistance, and yet, or
rather consequently, this resistance is never in a position
of exteriority in relation to power. Should it be said that
one is always "inside" power, there is no "escaping" it,
there is no absolute outside where it is concerned, because
one is subject to the law in any case? Or that, history being
the ruse of reason, power is the ruse of history, always
emerging the winner? This would be to misunderstand the
strictly relational character of power relationships. Their
existence depends on a multiplicity of points of resistance:
these play the role of adversary, target, support, or handle
in power relations. These points of resistance are present
everywhere in the power network. Hence there is no single

96

The History of Sexuality

locus of great Refusal, no soul of revolt, source of all
rebellions, or pure law of the revolutionary. Instead there
is a plurality of resistances, each of them a special case:
resistances that are possible, necessary, improbable; others
that are spontaneous, savage, solitary, concerted, ram­
pant, or violent; still others that are quick to compromise,
interested, or sacrificial; by definition, they can only exist
in the strategic field of power relations. But this does not
mean that they are only a reaction or rebound, forming
with respect to the basic domination an underside that is
in the end always passive, doomed to perpetual defeat.
Resistances do not derive from a few heterogeneous prin­
ciples; but neither are they a lure or a promise that is of
necessity betrayed. They are the odd term in relations of
power; they are inscribed in the latter as an irreducible
opposite. Hence they too are distributed in irregular fash­
ion: the points, knots, or focuses of resistance are spread
over time and space at varying densities, at times mobiliz­
ing groups or individuals in a definitive way, inflaming
certain points of the body, certain moments in life, certain
types of behavior. Are there no great radical ruptures,
massive binary divisions, then? Occasionally, yes. But
more often one is dealing with mobile and transitory
points of resistance, producing cleavages in a society- that
shift about, fracturing unities and effecting regroupings,
furrowing across individuals themselves, cutting them up
and remolding them, marking off irreducible regions in
them, in their bodies and minds. Just as the network of
power relations ends by forming a dense web that passes
through apparatuses and institutions, without being ex­
actly localized in them, so too the swarm of points of
resistance traverses social stratifications and individual
unities. And it is doubtless the strategic codification of
these points of resistance that makes a revolution possible,
somewhat similar to the way in which the state relies on
the institutional integration of power relationships.

The Deployment of Sexuality

97

It is in this sphere of force relations that we must try to
analyze the mechanisms of power. In this way we will escape
from the system of Law-and-Sovereign which has captivated
political thought for such a long time. And if it is true that
Machiavelli was among the few-and this no doubt was the
scandal of his "cynicism"-who conceived the power of the
Prince in terms of force relationships, perhaps we need to go
one step further, do without the persona of the Prince, and
decipher power mechanisms on the basis of a strategy that
is immanent in force relationships.
To return to sex and the discourses of truth that have
taken charge of it, the question that we must address, then,
is not: Given a specific state structure, how and why is it that
power needs to establish a knowledge of sex? Neither is the
question: What over-all domination was served by the con­
cern, evidenced since the eighteenth century, to produce true
discourses on sex? Nor is it: What law presided over both the
regularity of sexual behavior and the conformity of what was
said about it? It is rather: In a specific type'of discourse on
sex, in a specific form of extortion of truth, appearing histori­
cally and in specific places (around the child's body, apropos
of women's sex, in connection with practices restricting
births, and so on), what were the most immediate, the most
local power relations at work? How did they make possible
these kinds of discourses, and conversely, how were these
discourses used to support power relations? How was the
action of these power relations modified by their very exer­
cise, entailing a strengthening of some terms and a weaken­
ing of others, with effects of resistance and counterinvest­
ments, so that there has never existed one type of stable
subjugation, given once and for all? How were these power
relations linked to one another according to the logic of a
great strategy, which in retrospect takes on the aspect of a
unitary and voluntarist politics of sex? In general terms:
rather than referring all the infinitesimal violences that are
exerted on sex, all the anxious gazes that are directed at it,

98

The History of Sexuality

and all the hiding places whose discovery is made into an
impossible task, to the unique form of a great Power, we
must immerse the expanding production of discourses on sex
in the field of multiple and mobile power relations.
Which leads us to advance, in a preliminary way, four
rules to follow. But these are not intended as methodological
imperatives; at most they are cautionary prescriptions.
1.

Rule of immanence

One must not suppose that there exists a certain sphere of
sexuality that would be the legitimate concern of a free and
disinterested scientific inquiry were it not the object of mech­
anisms of prohibition brought to bear by the economic or
ideological requirements of power. If sexuality was con­
stituted as an area of investigation, this was only because
relations of power had established it as a possible object; and
conversely, if power was able to take it as a target, this was
because techniques of knowledge and procedures of dis­
course were capable of investing it. Between techniques of
knowledge and strategies of power, there is no exteriority,
even if they have specific roles and are linked together on the
basis of their difference. We will start, therefore, from what
might be called "local centers" of power-knowledge: for ex­
ample, the relations that obtain between penitents and
confessors, or the faithful and their directors of conscience.
Here, guided by the theme of the "flesh" that must be mas­
tered, different forms of discourse-self-examination, ques­
tionings, admissions, interpretations, interviews-were the
vehicle of a kind of incessant back-and-forth movement of
forms of subjugation and schemas of knowledge. Similarly,
the body of the child, under surveillance, surrounded in his
cradle, his bed, or his room by an entire watch-crew of
parents, nurses, servants, educators, and doctors, all atten­
tive to the least manifestations of his sex, has constituted,
particularly since the eighteenth century, another "local cen­
ter" of power-knowledge.

The Deployment of Sexuality

2.

99

Rules of continual variations

We must not look for who has the power in the order of
sexuality (men, adults, parents, doctors) and who is deprived
of it (women, adolescents, children, patients); nor for who
has the right to know and who is forced to remain ignorant.
We must seek rather the pattern of the modifications which
the relationships of force imply by the very nature of their
process. The "distributions of power" and the "appropria­
tions of knowledge" never represent only instantaneous
slices taken from processes involving, for example, a cumula­
tive reinforcement of the strongest factor, or a reversal of
relationship, or again, a simultaneous increase of two terms.
Relations of power-knowledge are not static forms of distri­
bution, they are "matrices of transformations. " The nine­
teenth-century grouping made up of the father, the mother,
the educator, and the doctor, around the child and his sex,
was subjected to constant modifications, continual shifts.
One of the more spectacular results of the latter was a strange
reversal: whereas to begin with the child's sexuality had been
problematized within the relationship established between
doctor and parents (in the form of advice, or recommenda­
tions to keep the child under observation, or warnings of
future dangers), ultimately it was in the relationship of the
psychiatrist to the child that the sexuality of adults them­
selves was called into question.
3.

Rule of double conditioning

No "local center," no "pattern of transformation" could
function if, through a series of sequences, it did not eventu­
ally enter into an over-all strategy. And inversely, no strategy
could achieve comprehensive effects if did not gain support
from precise and tenuous relations serving, not as its point
of application or final outcome, but as its prop and anchor
point. There is no discontinuity between them, as if one were
dealing with two different levels (one microscopic and the

1 00

The History o f Sexuality

other macroscopic); but neither is there homogeneity (as if
the one were only the enlarged projection or the miniaturiza­
tion of the other); rather, one must conceive of the double
conditioning of a strategy by the specificity of possible tac­
tics, and of tactics by the strategic envelope that makes them
work. Thus the father in the family is not the "representa­
tive" of the sovereign or the state; and the latter are not
projections of the father on a different scale. The family does
not duplicate society, just as society does not imitate the
family. But the family organization, precisely to the extent
that it was insular and heteromorphous with respect to the
other power mechanisms, was used to support the great
"maneuvers" employed for the Malthusian control of the
birthrate, for the populationist incitements, for the medicali­
zation of sex and the psychiatrization of its nongenital forms.
4.

Rule of the tactical polyvalence of discourses

What is said about sex must not be analyzed simply as the
surface of projection of these power mechanisms. Indeed, it
is in discourse that power and knowledge are joined together.
And for this very reason, we must conceive discourse as a
series of discontinuous segments whose tactical function is
neither uniform nor stable. To be more precise, we must not
imagine a world of discourse divided between accepted dis­
course and excluded discourse, or bet)Veen the dominant
discourse and the dominated one; but as a multiplicity of
discursive elements that can come into play in various strate­
gies. It is t�is distribution that we must reconstruct, with the
things said and those concealed, the enunciations required
and those forbidden, that it comprises; with the variants and
different effects-according to who is speaking, his position
of power, the institutional context in which he happens to be
situated-that it implies; and with the shifts and reutiliza­
tions of identical formulas for contrary objectives that it also
includes. Discourses are not once and for all subservient to

The Deployment of Sexuality

101

power o r raised u p against it, any more than silences are. We
must make allowance for the complex and unstable process
whereby discourse can be both an instrument and an effect
of power, but also a hindrance, a stumbling-block, a point of
resistance and a starting point for an opposing strategy. Dis­
course transmits and produces power; it reinforces it, but
also undermines and exposes it, renders it fragile and makes
it possible to thwart it. In like manner, silence and secrecy
are a shelter for power, anchoring its prohibitions; but they
also loosen its holds and provide for relatively obscure areas
of tolerance. Consider for example the history of what was
once "the" great sin against nature. The extreme discretion
of the texts dealing with sodomy-that utterly confused cate­
gory-and the nearly universal reticence in talking about it
made possible a twofold operation: on the one hand, there
was an extreme severity (punishment by fire was meted out
well into the eighteenth century, without there being any
substantial protest expressed before the middle of the cen­
tury), and on the other hand, a tolerance that must have been
widespread (which one can deduce indirectly from the infre­
quency of judicial sentences, and which one glimpses more
directly through certain statements concerning societies of
men that were thought to exist in the army or in the courts).
There is no question that the appearance in nineteenth-cen­
tury psychiatry, jurisprudence, and literature of a whole se­
ries of discourses on the species and subspecies of homosexu­
ality, inversion, pederasty, and "psychic hermaphrodism"
made possible a strong advance of social controls into this
area of "perversity"; but it also made possible the formation
of a "reverse" discourse: homosexuality began to speak in its
own behalf, to demand that its legitimacy or "naturality" be
acknowledged, often in the same vocabulary, using the same
categories by which it was medically disqualified. There is
not, on the one side, a discourse of power, and opposite it,
another discourse that runs counter to it. Discourses are
tactical elements or blocks operating in the field of force

102

The History of Sexuality

relations; there can exist different and even contradictory
discourses within the same strategy; they can, on the con­
trary, circulate without changing their form from one strat­
egy to another, opposing strategy. We must not expect the
discourses on sex to tell us, above all, what strategy they
derive from, or what moral divisions they accompany, or
what ideology-dominant or dominated-they represent;
rather we must question them on the two levels of their
tactical productivity (what reciprocal effects of power and
knowledge they ensure) and their strategical integration
(what conjunction and what force relationship make their
utilization necessary in a given episode of the various con­
frontations that occur).
In short, it is a question of orienting ourselves to a concep­
tion of power which replaces the privilege of the law with the
viewpoint of the objective, the privilege of prohibition with
the viewpoint of tactical efficacy, the privilege of sovereignty
with the analysis of a multiple and mobile field of force
relations, wherein far-reaching, but never completely stable,
effects of domination are produced. The strategical model,
rather than the model based on law. And this, not out of a
speculative choice or theoretical preference, but because in
fact it is one of the essential traits of Western societies that
the force relationships which for a long time had found
expression in war, in every form of warfare, gradually be­
came invested in the order of political power.

3
Domain

Sexuality must not be described as a stubborn drive, by
nature alien and of necessity disobedient to a power which
exhausts itself trying to subdue it and often fails to control
it entirely. It appears rather as an especially dense transfer
point for relations of power: between men and women, young
people and old people, parents and offspring, teachers and
students, priests and laity, an administration and a popula­
tion. Sexuality is not the most intractable element in power
relations, but rather one of those endowed with the greatest
instrumentality: useful for the greatest number of maneuvers
and capable of serving as a point of support, as a linchpin,
for the most varied strategies.
There is no single, all-encompassing strategy, valid for all
of society and uniformly bearing on all the manifestations of
sex. For example, the idea that there have been repeated
attempts, by various means, to reduce all of sex to its repro­
ductive function, its heterosexual and adult form, and its
matrimonial legitimacy fails to take into account the mani­
fold objectives aimed for, the manifold means employed in
the different sexual politics concerned with the two sexes, the
different age groups and social classes.
In a first approach to the problem, it seems that we can
distinguish four great strategic unities which, beginning in
the eighteenth century, formed specific mechanisms of
knowledge and power centering on sex. These did not come
103

1 04

The History of Sexuality

into being fully developed at that time; but it was then that
they took on a consistency and gained an effectiveness in the
order of power, as well as a productivity in the order of
knowledge, so that it is possible to describe them in their
relative autonomy.
1 . A hysterization of women 's bodies: a threefold process
whereby the feminine body was analyzed-qualified and dis­
qualified-as being thoroughly saturated with sexuality;
whereby it was integrated into the sphere of medical prac­
tices, by reason ofa pathology intrinsic to it; whereby, finally,
it was placed in organic communication with the social body
(whose regulated fecundity it was supposed to ensure), the
family space (of which it had to be a substantial and func­
tional element), and the life of children (which it produced
and had to guarantee, by virtue of a biologico-moral respon­
sibility lasting through the entire period of the children's
education): the Mother, with her negative image of "nervous
woman," constituted the most visible form of this hysteriza­
tion.
2. A pedagogization of children 's sex: a double assertion
that practically all children indulge or are prone to indulge
in sexual activity; and that, being unwarranted, at the same
time "natural" and "contrary to nature," this sexual activity
posed physical and moral, individual and collective dangers;
children were defined as "preliminary" sexual beings, on this
side of sex, yet within it, astride a dangerous dividing line.
Parents, families, educators, doctors, and eventually psy­
chologists would have to take charge, in a continuous way,
of this precious and perilous, dangerous and endangered
sexual potential: this pedagogization was especially evident
in the war against onanism, which in the West lasted nearly
two centuries.
3. A socialization ofprocreative behavior: an economic so­
cialization via all the incitements and restrictions, the "so­
cial" and fiscal measures brought to bear on the fertility of

The Deployment of Sexuality

105

couples; a political socialization achieved through the "re­
sponsibilization" of couples with regard to the social body as
a whole (which had to be limited or on the contrary rein­
vigorated), and a medical socialization carried out by at­
tributing a pathogenic value-for the individual and the spe­
cies-to birth-control practices.
4. A psychiatrization of perverse pleasure: the sexual in­
stinct was isolated as a separate biological and psychical
instinct; a clinical analysis was made of all the forms of
anomalies by which it could be afflicted; it was assigned a role
of normalization or pathologization with respect to all be­
havior; and finally, a corrective technology was sought for
these anomalies.
Four figures emerged from this preoccupation with sex,
which mounted throughout the nineteenth century-four
privileged objects of knowledge, which were also targets and
anchorage points for the ventures of knowledge: the hysteri­
cal woman, the masturbating child, the Malthusian couple,
and the perverse adult. Each of them corresponded to one of
these strategies which, each in its own way, invested and
made use of the sex of women, children, and men.
What was at issue in these strategies? A struggle against
sexuality? Or were they part of an effort to gain control of
it? An attempt to regulate it more effectively and mask its
more indiscreet, conspicuous, and intractable aspects? A way
of formulating only that measure of knowledge about it that
was acceptable or useful? In actual fact, what was involved,
rather, was the very production of sexuality. Sexuality must
not be thought of as a kind of natural given which power tries
to hold in check, or as an obscure domain which knowledge
tries gradually to uncover. It is the name that can be given
to a historical construct: not a furtive reality that is difficult
to grasp, but a great surface network in which the stimula­
tion of bodies, the intensification of pleasures, the incitement

106

The History of Sexuality

to discourse, the formation of special knowledges, the
strengthening of controls and resistances, are linked to one
another, in accordance with a few major strategies of knowl­
edge and power.
It will be granted no doubt that relations of sex gave rise,
in every society, to a deployment of alliance: a system of
marriage, of fixation and development of kinship ties, of
transmission of names and possessions. This deployment of
alliance, with the mechanisms of constraint that ensured its
existence and the complex knowledge it often required, lost
some of its importance as economic processes and political
structures could no longer rely on it as an adequate instru­
ment or sufficient support. Particularly from the eighteenth
century onward, Western societies created and deployed a
new apparatus which was superimposed on the previous one,
and which, without completely supplanting the latter, helped
to reduce its importance. I am speaking of the deployment of
sexuality: like the deployment ofalliance, it connects up with
the circuit of sexual partners, but in a completely different
way. The two systems can be contrasted term by term. The
deployment of alliance is built around a system of rules
defining the permitted and the forbidden, the licit and the
illicit, whereas the deployment of sexuality operates accord­
ing to mobile, polymorphous, and contingent techniques of
power. The deployment of alliance has as one of its chief
objectives to reproduce the interplay of relations and main­
tain the law that governs them; the deployment of sexuality,
on the other hand, engenders a continual extension of areas
and forms of control. For the first, what is pertinent is the
link between partners and definite statutes; the second is
concerned with the sensations of the body, the quality of
pleasures, and the nature of impressions, however tenuous or
imperceptible these may be. Lastly, if the deployment of
alliance is firmly tied to the economy due to the role it can
play in the transmission or circulation of wealth, the deploy­
ment of sexuality is linked to the economy through numer-

The Deployment of Sexuality

107

ous and subtle relays, the main one of which, however, is the
body-the body that produces and consumes. In a word, the
deployment of alliance is attuned to a homeostasis of the
social body, which it has the function of maintaining; whence
its privileged link with the law; whence too the fact that the
important phase for it is "reproduction." The deployment of
sexuality has its reason for being, not in reproducing itself,
but in proliferating, innovating, annexing, creating, and
penetrating bodies in an increasingly detailed way, and in
controlling populations in an increasingly comprehensive
way. We are compelled, then, to accept three or four hypoth­
eses which run counter to the one on which the theme of a
sexuality repressed by the modern forms of society is based:
sexuality is tied to recent devices of power; it has been ex­
panding at an increasing rate since the seventeenth century;
the arrangement that has sustained it is not governed by
reproduction; it has been linked from the outset with an
intensification of the body-with its exploitation as an object
of knowledge and an element in relations of power.
It is not exact to say that the deployment of sexuality
supplanted the deployment of alliance. One can imagine that
one day it will have replaced it. But as things stand at pre­
sent, while it does tend to cover up the deployment of alli­
ance, it has neither obliterated the latter nor rendered it
useless. Moreover, historically it was around and on the basis
of the deployment of alliance that the deployment of sexual­
ity was constructed. First the practice of penance, then that
of the examination of conscience and spiritual direction, was
the formative nucleus: as we have seen,l what was at issue to
begin with at the tribunal of penance was sex insofar as it was
the basis of relations; the questions posed had to do with the
commerce allowed or forbidden (adultery, extramarital rela­
tions, relations with a person prohibited by blood or statute,
the legitimate or illegitimate character of the act of sexual
I Cf page 37 above.

108

congress); then, coinciding with the new pastoral and its
application in seminaries, secondary schools, and convents,
there was a gradual progression away from the problematic
of relations toward a problematic of the "flesh," that is, of
the body, sensation, the nature of pleasure, the more secret
forms of enjoyment or acquiescence. "Sexuality" was taking
shape, born of a technology of power that was originally
focused on alliance. Since then, it has not ceased to operate
in conjunction with a system of alliance on which it has
depended for support. The family cell, in the form in which
it came to be valued in the course of the eighteenth century,
made it possible for the main elements of the deployment of
sexuality (the feminine body, infantile precocity, the regula­
tion of births, and to a lesser extent no doubt, the specifica­
tion of the perverted) to develop along its two primary
dimensions: the husband-wife axis and the parents-children
axis. The family, in its contemporary form, must not be
understood as a social, economic, and political structure of
alliance that excludes or at least restrains sexuality, that
diminishes it as much as possible, preserving only its useful
functions. On the contrary, its role is to anchor sexuality and
provide it with a permanent support. It ensures the produc­
tion of a sexuality that is not homogeneous with the privi­
leges of alliance, while making it possible for the systems of
alliance to be imbued with a new tactic of power which they
would otherwise be impervious to. The family is the inter­
change of sexuality and alliance: it conveys the law and the
juridical dimension in the deployment of sexuality; and it
conveys the economy of pleasure and the intensity of sensa­
tions in the regime of alliance.
This interpenetration of the deployment of alliance and
that of sexuality in the form of the family allows us to under­
stand a number of facts: that since the eighteenth century the
family has become an obligatory locus of affects, feelings,
love; that sexuality has its privileged point of development in
the family; that for this reason sexuality is "incestuous" from

The Deployment of Sexuality

109

the start. It may be that in societies where the mechanisms
of alliance predominate, prohibition of incest is a function­
ally indispensable rule. But in a society such as ours, where
the family is the most active site of sexuality, and where it
is doubtless the exigencies of the latter which maintain and
prolong its existence, incest-for different reasons altogether
and in a completely different way-occupies a central place;
it is constantly being solicited and refused; it is an object of
obsession and attraction, a dreadful secret and an indispens­
able pivot. It is manifested as a thing that is strictly forbidden
in the family insofar as the latter functions as a deployment
of alliance; but it is also a thing that is continuously de­
manded in order for the family to be a hotbed of constant
sexual incitement. If for more than a century the West has
displayed such a strong interest in the prohibition of incest,
if more or less by common accord it has been seen as a social
universal and one of the points through which every society
is obliged to pass on the way to becoming a culture, perhaps
this is because it was found to be a means of self-defense, not
against an incestuous desire, but against the expansion and
the implications of this deployment of sexuality which had
been set up, but which, among its its many benefits, had the
disadvantage of ignoring the laws and juridical forms of
alliance. By asserting that all societies without exception,
and consequently our own, were subject to this rule of rules,
one guaranteed that this deployment of sexuality, whose
strange effects were beginning to be felt-among them, the
affective intensification of the family space...=.w
....- ould not be
able to escape from the grand and ancient system of alliance.
Thus the law would be secure, even in the new mechanics of
power. For this is the paradox of a society which, from the
eighteenth century to the present, has created so many tech­
nologies of power that are foreign to the concept of law: it
fears the effects and proliferations of those technologies and
attempts to recode them in forms of law. If one considers the
threshold of all culture to be prohibited incest, then sexuality

1 10

The History of Sexuality

has been, from the dawn of time, under the sway of law and
right. By devoting so much effort to an endless reworking of
the transcultural theory of the incest taboo, anthropology
has proved worthy of the whole modern deployment of sexu­
ality and the theoretical discourses it generates.
What has taken place since the seventeenth century can be
interpreted in the following manner: the deployment of
sexuality which first developed on the fringes of familial
institutions (in the direction of conscience and pedagogy, for
example) gradually became focused on the family: the alien,
irreducible, and even perilous effects it held in store for the
deployment of alliance (an awareness of this danger was
evidenced in the criticism often directed at the indiscretion
of the directors, and in the entire controversy, which oc­
curred somewhat later, over the private or public, institu­
tional or familial education of children2) were absorbed by
the family, a family that was reorganized, restricted no
doubt, and in any case intensified in comparison with the
functions it formerly exercised in the deployment of alliance.
In the family, parents and relatives became the chief agents
of a deployment of sexuality which drew its outside support
from doctors, educators, and later psychiatrists, and which
began by competing with the relations of alliance but soon
"psychologized" or "psychiatrized" the latter. Then these
new personages made their appearance: the nervous woman,
the frigid wife, the indifferent mother-or worse, the mother
beset by murderous obsessions-the impotent, sadistic,
perverse husband, the hysterical or neurasthenic girl, the
precocious and already exhausted child, and the young
homosexual who rejects marriage or neglects his wife. These
were the combined figures of an alliance gone bad and an
abnormal sexuality; they were the means by which the dis­
turbing factors of the latter were brought into the former;
Moliere's Tartuffe and Jakob Michael Lenz's Tutor, separated by more than a
century, both depict the interference of the deployment of sexuality in the family
organization, apropos of spiritual direction in TartuJfe and education in The Tutor.

2

The Deployment of Sexuality

111

and yet they also provided an opportunity for the alliance
system to assert its prerogatives in the order of sexuality.
Then a pressing demand emanated from the family: a
plea for help in reconciling these unfortunate conflicts be­
tween sexuality and alliance; and, caught in the grip of
this deployment of sexuality which had invested it from
without, contributing to its solidification into its modern
form, the family broadcast the long complaint of its sex­
ual suffering to doctors, educators, psychiatrists, priests,
and pastors, to all the "experts" who would listen. It was
as if it had suddenly discovered the dreadful secret of
what had always been hinted at and inculcated in it: the
family, the keystone of alliance, was the germ of all the
misfortunes of sex. And 10 and behold, from the mid­
nineteenth century onward, the family engaged in search­
ing out the slightest traces of sexuality in its midst,
wrenching from itself the most difficult confessions, solic­
iting an audience with everyone who might know some­
thing about the matter, and opening itself unreservedly to
endless examination. The family was the crystal in the de­
ployment of sexuality: it seemed to be the source of a sex­
uality which it actually only reflected and diffracted. By
virtue of its permeability, and through that process of re­
flections to the outside, it became one of the most valu­
able tactical components of the deployment.
But this development was not without its tensions and
problems. Charcot doubtless constituted a central figure in
this as well. For many years he was the most noteworthy of
all those to whom families, burdened down as they were with
this sexuality that saturated them, appealed for mediation
and treatment. On receiving parents who brought him their
children, husbands their wives, and wives their husbands,
from the world over, his first concern was to separate the
"patient" from his family, and the better to observe him, he
would pay as little attention as possible to what the family

1 12

The History of Sexuality

had to say.3 He sought to detach the sphere of sexuality from
the system of alliance, in order to deal with it directly
through a medical practice whose technicity and autonomy
were guaranteed by the neurological model. Medicine thus
assumed final responsibility, according to the rules of a spe­
cific knowledge, for a sexuality which it had in fact urged
families to concern themselves with as an essential task and
a major danger. Moreover, Charcot noted on several occa­
sions how difficult it was for families to "yield" the patient
whom they nonetheless had brought to the doctor, how they
laid siege to the mental hospitals where the subject was being
kept out of view, and the ways in which they were constantly
interfering with the doctor's work. Their worry was unwar­
ranted, however: the therapist only intervened in order to
return to them individuals who were sexually compatible
with the family system; and while this intervention manipu­
lated the sexual body, it did not authorize the latter to define
itself in explicit discourse. One must not speak of these "geni­
tal causes": so went the phrase-muttered in a muted voice
-which the most famous ears of our time overheard one day
in 1 886, from the mouth of Charcot.
This was the context in which psychoanalysis set to work;
but not without substantially modifying the pattern of anxie­
ties and reassurances. In the beginning it must have given
rise to distrust and hostility, for, pushing Charcot's lesson to
the extreme, it undertook to examine the sexuality of in­
dividuals outside family control; it brought this sexuality to
light without covering it over again with the neurological
model; more serious still, it called family relations into ques­
tion in the analysis it made of them. But despite everything,
Jean-Martin Charcot, Lerons de Mardi, January 7, 1888: "In order to properly
treat a hysterical girl, one must not leave her with her father and mother; she needs
to be placed in a mental hospital. . . . Do you know how long well-behaved little
girls cry for their mothers after they part company? . . . Let us take the average,
if you will; it's not very long, a half· hour or thereabouts."
February 21, 1888: "In the case of hysteria of young boys, what one must do is
to separate them from their mothers. So long as they are with their mothers, nothing
is of any use. . . . The father is sometimes j ust as unbearable as the mother; it is
best, then, to get rid of them both."

psychoanalysis, whose technical procedure seemed to place
the confession of sexuality outside family jurisdiction, redis­
covered the law of alliance, the involved workings of mar­
riage and kinship, and incest at the heart of this sexuality, as
the principle of its formation and the key to its intelligibility.
The guarantee that one would find the parents-children rela­
tionship at the root of everyone's sexuality made it possible
-even when everything seemed to point to the reverse proc­
ess-to keep the deployment of sexuality coupled to the
system of alliance. There was no risk that sexuality would
appear to be, by nature, alien to the law: it was constituted
only through the law. Parents, do not be afraid to bring your
children to analysis: it will teach them that in any case it is
you whom they love. Children, you really shouldn't com­
plain that you are not orphans, that you always rediscover
in your innermost selves your Object-Mother or the sover­
eign sign of your Father: it is through them that you gain
access to desire. Whence, after so many reticences, the enor­
mous consumption of analysis in societies where the deploy­
ment of alliance and the family system needed strengthening.
For this is one of the most significant aspects of this entire
history of the deployment of sexuality: it had its beginnings
in the technology of the "flesh" in classical Christianity,
basing itself on the alliance system and the rules that gov­
erned the latter; but today it fills a reverse function in that
it tends to prop up the old deployment of alliance. From the
direction of conscience to psychoanalysis, the deployments
of alliance and sexuality were involved in a slow process that
had them turning about one another until, more than three
centuries later, their positions were reversed; in the Christian
pastoral, the law of alliance codified the flesh which was just
being discovered and fitted it into a framework that was still
juridical in character; with psychoanalysis, sexuality gave
body and life to the rules of alliance by saturating them with
desire.
Hence the domain we must analyze in the different studies
that will follow the present volume is that deployment of

1 14

The History of Sexuality

sexuality: its formation on the basis of the Christian notion
of the flesh, and its development through the four great
strategies that were deployed in the nineteenth century: the
sexualization of children, the hysterization of women, the
specification of the perverted, and the regulation of popula­
tions-all strategies that went by way of a family which must
be viewed, not as a powerful agency of prohibition, but as a
major factor of sexualization.
The first phase corresponded to the need to form a "labor
force" (hence to avoid any useless "expenditure," any wasted
energy, so that all forces were reduced to labor capacity
alone) and to ensure its reproduction (conjugality, the regu­
lated fabrication of children). The second phase corre­
sponded to that epoch of Spatkapitalismus in which the
exploitation of wage labor does not demand the same violent
and physical constraints as in the nineteenth century, and
where the politics of the body does not require the elision of
sex or its restriction solely to the reproductive function; it
relies instead on a multiple channeling into the controlled
circuits of the economy-on what has been called a hyper­
repressive desublimation.
If the politics of sex makes little use of the law of the taboo
but brings into play an entire technical machinery, if what
is involved is the production of sexuality rather than the
repression of sex, then our emphasis has to be placed else­
where; we must shift our analysis away from the problem of
"labor capacity" and doubtless abandon the diffuse energet­
ics that underlies the theme of a sexuality repressed for eco­
nomIC reasons.

4
Periodization

The history of sexuality supposes two ruptures if one tries
to center it on mechanisms of repression. The first, occurring
in the course of the seventeenth century, was characterized
by the advent of the great prohibitions, the exclusive promo­
tion of adult marital sexuality, the imperatives of decency,
the obligatory concealment of the body, the reduction to
silence and mandatory reticences of language. The second, a
twentieth-century phenomenon, was really less a rupture
than an inflexion of the curve: this was the moment when the
mechanisms of repression were seen as beginning to loosen
their grip; one passed from insistent sexual taboos to a rela­
tive tolerance with regard to prenuptial or extramarital rela­
tions; the disqualification of "perverts" diminished, their
condemnation by the law was in part eliminated; a good
many of the taboos that weighed on the sexuality of children
were lifted.
We must attempt to trace the chronology of these devices:
the inventions, the instrumental mutations, and the renova­
tions of previous techniques. But there is also the calendar
of their utilization to consider, the chronology of their diffu­
sion and of the effects (of subjugation and resistance) they
produced. These multiple datings doubtless will not coincide
with the great repressive cycle that is ordinarily situated
between the sev.enteenth and the twentieth centuries.
1 . The chronology of the techniques themselves goes back

1 15

1 16

The History of Sexuality

a long way. Their point of formation must be sought in the
penitential practices of medieval Christianity, or rather in
the dual series constituted by the obligatory, exhaustive, and
periodic confession imposed on all the faithful by the Lateran
Council and by the methods of asceticism, spiritual exercise,
and mysticism that evolved with special intensity from the
sixteenth century on. First the Reformation, then Tridentine
Catholicism, mark an important mutation and a schism in
what might be called the "traditional technology of the
flesh." A division whose depth should not be under­
estimated; but this did not rule out a certain parallelism in
the Catholic and Protestant methods of examination of con­
science and pastoral direction: procedures for analyzing
"concupiscence" and transforming it into discourse were
established in both instances. This was a rich, refined tech­
nique which began to take shape in the sixteenth century and
went through a long series of theoretical elaborations until,
at the end of the eighteenth century, it became fixed in ex­
pressions capable of symbolizing the mitigated strictness of
Alfonso de' Liguori in the one case and Wesleyan pedagogy
in the other.
It was during the same period-the end of the eighteenth
century-and for reasons that will have to be determined,
that there emerged a completely new technology of sex; new
in that for the most part it escaped the ecclesiastical institu­
tion without being truly independent of the thematics of sin.
Through pedagogy, medicine; and economics, it made sex
not only a secular concern but a concern of the state as well;
to be more exact, sex became a matter that required the social
body as a whole, and virtually all of its individuals, to place
themselves under surveillance. New too for the fact that it
expanded along three axes: that of pedagogy, having as its
objective the specific sexuality of children; that of medicine,
whose objective was the sexual physiology peculiar to
women; and last, that of demography, whose objective was
the spontaneous or concerted regulation of births. Thus the

The Deployment of Sexuality

1 17

"sin of youth," "nervous disorders," and "frauds against
procreation" (as those "deadly secrets" were later to be
called) designate three privileged areas of this new technol­
ogy. There is no question that in each of these areas, it went
back to methods that had already been formed by Christian­
ity, but of course not without modifying them: the sexuality
of children was already problematized in the spiritual
pedagogy of Christianity (it is interesting to note that Molli­
ties, the first treatise on sin, was written in the fifteenth
century by an educator and mystic named Gerson, and that
the Onania collection compiled by Dekker in the eighteenth
century repeats word for word examples set forth by the
Anglican pastoral); the eighteenth-century medicine of
nerves and vapors took up in turn a field of analysis that had
already been delimited when the phenomena of possession
fomented a grave crisis in the all too indiscreet practices of
conscience direction and spiritual examination (nervous ill­
ness is certainly not the truth of possession, but the medicine
of hysteria is not unrelated to the earlier direction of "ob­
sessed" women); and the campaigns apropos of the birthrate
took the place of the control of conjugal relations-in a
different form and at another level-which the Christian
penance had so persistently sought to establish through its
examinations. A visible continuity, therefore, but one that
did not prevent a major transformation: from that time on,
the technology of sex was ordered in relation to the medical
institution, the exigency of normality, and-instead of the
question of death and everlasting punishment-the problem
of life and illness. The flesh was brought down to the level
of the organism.
This mutation took place at the turn of the nineteenth
century; it opened the way for many other transformations
that derived from it. The first of these set apart the medicine
of sex from the medicine of the body; it isolated a sexual
"instinct" capable of presenting constitutive anomalies, ac­
quired derivations, infirmities, or pathological processes.

1 18

The History of Sexuality

Heinrich Kaan's Psychopathia Sexualis, published in 1 846,
can be used as an indicator: these were the years that saw the
correlative appearance of a medicine, an "orthopedics,"
specific to sex: in a word, the opening up of the great medico­
psychological domain of the "perversions," which was
destined to take over from the old moral categories of de­
bauchery and excess. In the same period, the analysis of
heredity was placing sex (sexual relations, venereal diseases,
matrimonial alliances, perversions) in a position of "biologi­
cal responsibility" with regard to the species: not only could
sex be affected by its own diseases, it could also, if it was not
controlled, transmit diseases or create others that would
afflict future generations. Thus it appeared to be the source
of an entire capital for the species to draw from. Whence the
medical-but also political-project for organizing a state
management of marriages, births, and life expectancies; sex
and its fertility had to be administered. The medicine of
perversions and the programs of eugenics were the two great
innovations in the technology of sex of the second half of the
nineteenth century.
Innovations that merged together quite well, for the
theory of "degenerescence" made it possible for them to
perpetually refer back to one another; it explained how a
heredity that was burdened with various maladies (it made
little difference whether these were organic, functional, or
psychical) ended by producing a sexual pervert (look into the
genealogy of an exhibitionist or a homosexual: you will find
a hemiplegic ancestor, a phthisic parent, or an uncle afflicted
with senile dementia); but it went on to explain how a sexual
perversion resulted in the depletion of one's line of descent
-rickets in the children, the sterility of future generations.
The series composed of perversion-heredity-degenerescence
formed the solid nucleus of the new technologies of sex. And
let it not be imagined that this was nothing more than a
medical theory which was scientifically lacking and improp­
erly moralistic. Its application was widespread and its im-

The Deployment of Sexuality

1 19

plantation went deep. Psychiatry, to be sure, but also juris­
prudence, legal medicine, agencies of social control, the sur­
veillance of dangerous or endangered children, all func­
tioned for a long time on the basis of "degen­
erescence" and the heredity-perversion system. An entire
social practice, which took the exasperated but coherent
form of a state-directed racism, furnished this technology of
sex with a formidable power and far-reaching consequences.
And the strange position of psychiatry at the end of the
nineteenth century would be hard to comprehend if one did
not see the rupture it brought about in the great system of
degenerescence: it resumed the project of a medical technol­
ogy appropriate for dealing with the sexual instinct; but it
sought to free it from its ties with heredity, and hence from
eugenics and the various racisms. It is very well to look back
from our vantage point and remark upon the normalizing
impulse in Freud; one can go on to denounce the role played
for many years by the psychoanalytic institution; but the fact
remains that in the great family of technologies of sex, which
goes so far back into the history of the Christian West, of all
those institutions that set out in the nineteenth century to
medicalize sex, it was the one that, up to the decade of the
forties, rigorously opposed the political and institutional
effects of the perversion-heredity-degenerescence system.
It is clear that the genealogy of all these techniques, with
their mutations, their shifts, their continuities and ruptures,
does not coincide with the hypothesis of a great repressive
phase that was inaugurated in the course of the classical age
and began to slowly decline in the twentieth. There was
rather a perpetual inventiveness, a steady growth of methods
and procedures, with two especially productive moments in
this proliferating history: around the middle of the sixteenth
century, the development of procedures of direction and
examination of conscience; and at the beginning of the nine­
teenth century, the advent of medical technologies of sex.
2. But the foregoing is still only a dating of the techniques

1 20

The History of Sexuality

themselves. The history of their spread and their point of
application is something else again. If one writes the history
of sexuality in terms of repression, relating this repression to
the utilization of labor capacity, one must suppose that sex­
ual controls were the more intense and meticulous as they
were directed at the poorer classes; one has to assume that
they followed the path of greatest domination and the most
systematic exploitation: the young adult man, possessing
nothing more than his life force, had to be the primary target
of a subjugation destined to shift the energy available for
useless pleasure toward compulsory labor. But this does not
appear to be the way things actually happened. On the con­
trary, the most rigorous techniques were formed and, more
particularly, applied first, with the greatest intensity, in the
economically privileged and politically dominant classes.
The direction of consciences, self-examination, the entire
long elaboration of the transgressions of the flesh, and the
scrupulous detection of concupiscence were all subtle proce­
dures that could only have been accessible to small groups
of people. It is true that the penitential method of Alfonso
de' Liguori and the rules recommended to the Methodists by
Wesley ensured that these procedures would be more widely
disseminated, after a fashion; but this was at the cost of a
considerable simplification.
The same can be said of the family as an agency of control
and a point of sexual saturation: it was in the "bourgeois" or
"aristocratic" family that the sexuality of children and
adolescents was first problematized, and feminine sexuality
medicalized; it was the first to be alerted to the potential
pathology of sex, the urgent need to keep it under close
watch and to devise a rational technology of correction. It
was this family that first became a locus for the psychiatriza­
tion of sex. Surrendering to fears, creating remedies, appeal­
ing for rescue by learned techniques, generating countless
discourses, it was the first to commit itself to sexual erethism.
The bourgeoisie began by considering that its own sex was

The Deployment of Sexuality

121

something importaIlt, a fragile treasure, a secret that had to
be discovered at all costs. It is worth remembering that the
first figure to be invested by the deployment of sexuality, one
of the first to be "sexualized," was the "idle" woman. She
inhabited the outer edge of the "world," in which she always
had to appear as a value, and of the family, where she was
assigned a new destiny charged with conjugal and parental
obligations. Thus there emerged the "nervous" woman, the
woman afflicted with "vapors"; in this figure, the hysteriza­
tion of woman found its anchorage point. As for the adoles­
cent wasting his future substance in secret pleasures, the
onanistic child who was of such concern to doctors and
educators from the end of the eighteenth century to the end
of the nineteenth, this was not the child of the people, the
future worker who had to be taught the disciplines of the
body, but rather the schoolboy, the child surrounded by
domestic servants, tutors, and governesses, who was in dan­
ger of compromising not so much his physical strength as his
intellectual capacity, his moral fiber, and the obligation to
preserve a healthy line of descent for his family and his social
class.
For their part, the working classes managed for a long
time to escape the deployment of "sexuality. " Of course,
they were subjected in specific ways to the deployment of
"alliances": the exploitation of legitimate marriage and fertil­
ity, the exclusion of consanguine sexual union, prescriptions
of social and local endogamy. On the other hand, it is un­
likely that the Christian technology of the flesh ever had any
importance for them. As for the mechanisms of sexualiza­
tion, these penetrated them slowly and apparently in three
successive stages. The first involved the problems of birth
control, when it was discovered, at the end of the eighteenth
century, that the art of fooling nature was not the exclusive
privilege of city dwellers and libertines, but was known and
practiced by those who, being close to nature itself, should
have held it to be more repugnant than anyone else did. Next

1 22

The History of Sexuality

the organization of the "conventional" family came to be
regarded, sometime around the eighteen-thirties, as an indis­
pensable instrument of political control and economic regu­
lation for the subjugation of the urban proletariat: there was
a great campaign for the "moralization of the poorer
classes. " The last stage came at the end of the nineteenth
century with the development of the juridical and medical
control of perversions, for the sake of a general protection of
society and the race. It can be said that this was the moment
when the deployment of "sexuality," elaborated in its more
complex and intense forms, by and for the privileged classes,
spread through the entire social body. But the forms it took
were not everywhere the same, and neither were the instru­
ments it employed (the respective roles of medical and judi­
cial authority were not the same in both instances; nor was
even the way in which medicine and sexuality functioned).
These chronological reminders-whether we are con­
cerned with the invention of techniques or the calendar of
their diffusion-are of some importance. They cast much
doubt on the idea of a repressive cycle, with a beginning and
an end and forming a curve with its point of irtflexion: it
appears unlikely that there was an age of sexual restriction.
They also make it doubtful that the process was homoge­
neous at all levels of society and in all social classes: there was
no unitary sexual politics. But above all, they make the
meaning of the process, and its reasons for being, problemati­
cal: it seems that the deployment of sexuality was not estab­
lished as a principle of limitation of the pleasures of others
by what have traditionally been called the "ruling classes."
Rather it appears to me that they first tried it on themselves.
Was this a new avatar of that bourgeois asceticism described
so many times in connection with the Reformation, the new
work ethic, and the rise of capitalism? It seems in fact that
what was involved was not an asceticism, in any case not a
renunciation of pleasure or a disqualification of the flesh, but

The Deployment of Sexuality

1 23

on the contrary an intensification of the body, a problemati­
zation of health and its operational terms: it was a question
of techniques for maximizing life. The primary concern was
not repression of the sex of the classes to be exploited, but
rather the body, vigor, longevity, progeniture, and descent of
the classes that "ruled." This was the purpose for which the
deployment of sexuality was first established, as a new distri­
bution of pleasures, discourses, truths, and powers; it has to
be seen as the self-affirmation of one class rather than the
enslavement of another: a defense, a protection, a strengthen­
ing, and an exaltation that were eventually extended to oth­
ers-at the cost of different transformations-as a means of
social control and political subjugation. With this investment
of its own sex by a technology of power and knowledge
which it had itself invented, the bourgeoisie underscored the
high political price of its body, sensations, and pleasures, its
well-being and survival. Let us not isolate the restrictions,
reticences, evasions, or silences which all these procedures
may have manifested, in order to refer them to some con­
stitutive taboo, psychical repression, or death instinct. What
was formed was a political ordering of life, not through an
enslavement of others, but through an affirmation of self.
And this was far from being a matter of the class which in
the eighteenth century became hegemonic believing itself
obliged to amputate from its body a sex that was useless,
expensive, and dangerous as soon as it was no longer given
over exclusively to reproduction; we can assert on the con­
trary that it provided itself with a body to be cared for,
protected, cultivated, and preserved from the many dangers
and contacts, to be isolated from others so that it would
retain its differential value; and this, by equipping itself with
-among other resources-a technology of sex.
Sex is not that part of the body which the bourgeoisie was
forced to disqualify or nullify in order to put those whom it
dominated to work. It is that aspect of itself which troubled
and preoccupied it more than any other, begged and obtained

1 24

The History of Sexuality

its attention, and which it cultivated with a mixture of fear,
curiosity, delight, and excitement. The bourgeoisie made this
element identical with its body, or at least subordinated the
latter to the former by attributing to it a mysterious and
undefined power; it staked its life and its death on sex by
making it responsible for its future welfare; it placed its hopes
for the future in sex by imagining it to have ineluctable effects
on generations to come; it subordinated its soul to sex by
conceiving of it as what constituted the soul's most secret and
determinant part. Let us not picture the bourgeoisie symboli­
cally castrating itself the better to refuse others the right to
have a sex and make use of it as they please. This class must
be seen rather as being occupied, from the mid-eighteenth
century on, with creating its own sexuality and forming a
specific body based on it, a "class" body with its health,
hygiene, descent, and race: the autosexualization of its body,
the incarnation of sex in its body, the endogamy of sex and
the body.
There were doubtless many reasons for this. First of all,
there was a transposition into different forms of the methods
employed by the nobility for marking and maintaining its
caste distinction; for the aristocracy had also asserted the
special character of its body, but this was in the form of
blood, that is, in the form of the antiquity of its ancestry and
of the value of its alliances; the bourgeoisie on the contrary
looked to its progeny and the health of its organism when it
laid claim to a specific body. The bourgeoisie's "blood" was
its sex. And this is more than a play on words; many of the
themes characteristic of the caste manners of the nobility
reappeared in the nineteenth-century bourgeoisie, but in the
guise of biological, medical, or eugenic precepts. The concern
with genealogy became a preoccupation with heredity; but
included in bourgeois marriages were not only economic
imperatives and rules of social homogeneity, not only the
promises of inheritance, but the menaces of heredity; families
wore and concealed a sort of reversed and somber escutcheon

The Deployment of Sexuality

125

whose defamatory quarters were the diseases or defects of the
group of relatives-the grandfather's general paralysis, the
mother's neurasthenia, the youngest child's phthisis, the hys­
terical or erotomanic aunts, the cousins with bad morals. But
there was more to this concern with the sexual body than the
bourgeois transposition of themes of the nobility for the
purpose of self-affirmation. A different project was also in­
volved: that of the indefinite extension of strength, vigor,
health, and life. The emphasis on the body should undoubt­
edly be linked to the process of growth and establishment of
bourgeois hegemony: not, however, because of the market
value assumed by labor capacity, but because of what the
"cultivation" of its own body could represent politically,
economically, and historically for the present and the future
of the bourgeoisie. Its dominance was in part dependent on
that cultivation; but it was not simply a matter of economy
or ideology, it was a "physical" matter as well. The works,
published in great numbers at the end of the eighteenth
century, on body hygiene, the art of longevity, ways of hav­
ing healthy children and of keeping them alive as long as
possible, and methods for improving the human lineage, bear
witness to the fact: they thus attest to the correlation of this
concern with the body and sex to a type of "racism." But the
latter was very different from that manifested by the nobility
and organized for basically conservative ends. It was a dy­
namic racism, a racism of expansion, even if it was still in a
budding state, awaiting the second half of the nineteenth
century to bear the fruits that we have tasted.
May I be forgiven by those for whom the bourgeoisie
signifies the elision of the body and the repression of sexual­
ity, for whom class struggle implies the fight to eliminate that
repression; the "spontaneous philosophy" of the bourgeoisie
is perhaps not as idealistic or castrating as is commonly
thought. In any event, one of its primary concerns was to
provide itself with a body and a sexuality-to ensure the
strength, endurance, and secular proliferation of that body

1 26

The History of Sexuality

through the organization of a deployment of sexuality. This
process, moreover, was linked to the movement by which it
asserted its distinctiveness and its hegemony. There is little
question that one of the primordial forms of class conscious­
ness is the affirmation of the body; at least, this was the case
for the bourgeoisie during the eighteenth century. It con­
verted the blue blood of the nobles into a sound organism and
a healthy sexuality. One understands why it took such a long
time and was so unwilling to acknowledge that other classes
had a body and a sex-precisely those classes it was exploit­
ing. The living conditions that were dealt to the proletariat,
particularly in the first half of the nineteenth century, show
there was anything but concern for its body and sex:l it was
of little importance whether those people lived or died, since
their reproduction was something that took care of itself in
any case. Conflicts were necessary (in particular, conflicts
over urban space: cohabitation, proximity, contamination,
epidemics, such as the cholera outbreak of 1 832, or again,
prostitution and venereal diseases) in order for the proletar­
iat to be granted a body and a sexuality; economic emergen­
cies had to arise (the development of heavy industry with the
need for a stable and competent labor force, the obligation
to regulate the population flow and apply demographic con­
trols); lastly, there had to be established a whole technology
of control which made it possible to keep that body and
sexuality, finally conceded to them, under surveillance
(schooling, the politics of housing, public hygiene, institu­
tions of relief and insurance, the general medicalization of
the population, in short, an entire administrative and techni­
cal machinery made it possible to safely import the deploy­
ment of sexuality into the exploited class; the latter no longer
risked playing an assertive class role opposite the bourgeoi­
sie; it would remain the instrument of the bourgeoisie's

hegemony). Whence no doubt the proletariat's hesitancy to
accept this deployment and its tendency to say that this
sexuality was the business of the the bourgeoisie and did not
concern it.
Some think they can denounce two symmetrical hypocri­
sies at the same time: the primary hypocrisy of the bourgeoi­
sie which denies its own sexuality, and the secondary hypoc­
risy of the proletariat which in turn rejects its sexuality by
accepting the dominant ideology. This is to misunderstand
the process whereby on the contrary the bourgeoisie en­
dowed itself, in an arrogant political affirmation, with a gar­
rulous sexuality which the proletariat long refused to accept,
since it was foisted on them for the purpose of subjugation.
If it is true that sexuality is the set of effects produced in
bodies, behaviors, and social relations by a certain deploy­
ment deriving from a complex political technology, one has
to admit that this deployment does not operate in symmetri­
cal fashion with respect to the social classes, and conse­
quently, that it does not produce the same effects in them.
We must return, therefore, to formulations that have long
been disparaged; we must say that there is a bourgeois sexu­
ality, and that there are class sexualities. Or rather, that
sexuality is originally, historically bourgeois, and that, in its
successive shifts and transpositions, it induces specific class
effects.
A few more words are in order. As we have noted, the
nineteenth century witnessed a generalization of the deploy­
ment of sexuality, starting from a hegemonic center. Eventu­
ally the entire social body was provided with a "sexual
body," although this was accomplished in different ways and
using different tools. Must we speak of the universality of
sexuality, then? It is at this point that one notes the introduc­
tion of a new differentiating element. Somewhat similar to
the way in which, at the end of the eighteenth century, the
bourgeoisie set its own body and its precious sexuality

128

The History o f Sexuality

against the valorous blood of the nobles, at the end of the
nineteenth century it sought to redefine the specific character
of its sexuality relative to that of others, subjecting it to a
thorough differential review, and tracing a dividing line that
would set apart and protect its body. This line was not the
same as the one which founded sexuality, but rather a bar
running through that sexuality; this was the taboo that con­
stituted the difference, or at least the manner in which the
taboo was applied and the rigor with which it was imposed.
It was here that the theory of repression-;-which was gradu­
ally expanded to cover the entire deployment of sexuality, so
that the latter came to be explained in terms of a generalized
taboo-had its point of origin. This theory is bound up his­
torically with the spread of the deployment of sexuality. On
the one hand, the theory would justify its authoritarian and
constraining influence by postulating that all sexuality must
be subject to the law; more precisely, that sexuality owes its
very definition to the action of the law: not only will you
submit your sexuality to the law, but you will have no sexual­
ity except by subjecting yourself to the law. But on the other
hand, the theory of repression would compensate for this
general spread of the deployment of sexuality by its analysis
of the differential interplay of taboos according to the social
classes. The discourse which at the end of the eighteenth
century said: "There is a valuable element within us that
must be feared and treated with respect; we must exercise
extreme care in dealing with it, lest it be the cause of count­
less evils," was replaced by a discourse which said: "Our
sexuality, unlike that of others, is subjected to a regime of
repression so intense as to present a constant danger; not
only is sex a formidable secret, as the directors of conscience,
moralists, pedagogues, and doctors always said to former
generations, not only must we search it out for the truth it
conceals, but if it carries with it so many dangers, this is
because-whether out of scrupulousness, an overly acute
sense of sin, or hypocrisy, no matter-we have too long

The Deployment of Sexuality

reduced it to silence. " Henceforth social differentiation
would be affirmed, not by the "sexual" quality of the body,
but by the intensity of its repression.
Psychoanalysis comes in at this juncture: both a theory of
the essential interrelatedness of the law and desire, and a
technique for relieving the effects of the taboo where its rigor
makes it pathogenic. In its historical emergence, psychoanal­
ysis cannot be dissociated from the generalization of the
deployment of sexuality and the secondary mechanisms of
differentiation that resulted from it. The problem of incest is
still significant in this regard. On one hand, as we have seen,
its prohibition was posited as an absolutely universal princi­
ple which made it possible to explain both the system of
alliance and the regime of sexuality; this taboo, in one form
or another, was valid therefore for every society and every
individual. But in practice psychoanalysis gave itself the task
of alleviating the effects of repression (for those who were in
a position to resort to psychoanalysis) that this prohibition
was capable of causing; it allowed individuals to express their
incestuous desire in discourse. But during the same period,
there was a systematic campaign being organized against the
kinds of incestuous practices that existed in rural areas or in
certain urban quarters inaccessible to psychiatry: an inten­
sive administrative and judicial grid was laid out then to put
an end to these practices. An entire polltics for die protection
of children or the placing of "endangered" minors under
guardianship had as its partial objective their withdrawal
from families that were suspected-through lack of space,
dubious proximity, a history of debauchery, antisocial
"primitiveness," or degenerescence-of practicing incest.
Whereas the deployment of sexuality had been intensifying
affective relations and physical proximity since the eigh­
teenth century, and although there had occurred a perpetual
incitement to incest in the bourgeois family, the regime of
sexuality applied to the lower classes on the contrary in­
volved the exclusion of incestuous practices or at least their

1 30

The History of Sexuality

displacement into another form. At a time when incest was
being hunted out as a conduct, psychoanalysis was busy
revealing it as a desire and alleviating-for those who suff­
ered from the desire-the severity which repressed it. We
must not forget that the discovery of the Oedipus complex
was contemporaneous with the juridical organization of loss
of parental authority (in France, this was formulated in the
laws of 1 889 and 1 898). At the moment when Freud was
uncovering the nature of Dora's desire and allowing it to be
put into words, preparations were being made to undo those
reprehensible proximities in other social sectors; on the one
hand, the father was elevated into an object of compulsory
love, but on the other hand, if he was a loved one, he was
at the same time a fallen one in the eyes of the law. Psychoa­
nalysis, as a limited therapeutic practice, thus played a differ­
entiating role with respect to other procedures, within a
deployment of sexuality that had come into general use.
Those who had lost the exclusive privilege of worrying over
their sexuality henceforth had the privilege of experiencing
more than others the thing that prohibited it and of possess­
ing the method which made it possible to remove the repres­
sion.
The history of the deployment of sexuality, as it has
evolved since the classical age, can serve as an archaeology
of psychoanalysis. We have seen in fact that psychoanalysis
plays several roles at once in this deployment: it is a mecha­
nism for attaching sexuality to the system of alliance; it
assumes an adversary position with respect to the theory of
degenerescence; it functions as a differentiating factor in the
general technology of sex. Around it the great requirement
of confession that had taken form so long ago assumed the
new meaning of an injunction to lift psychical repression.
The task of truth was now linked to the challenging of
taboos.
This same development, moreover, opened up the possibil­
ity of a substantial shift in tactics, consisting in: reinterpret-

The Deployment of Sexuality

131

ing the deployment of sexuality in terms of a generalized
repression; tying this repression to general mechanisms of
domination and exploitation; and linking together the proc­
esses that make it possible to free oneself both of repression
and of domination and exploitation. Thus between the two
world wars there was formed, around Reich, the historico­
political critique of sexual repression. The importance of this
critique and its impact on reality were substantial. But the
very possibility of its success was tied to the fact that it
always unfolded within the deployment of sexuality, and not
outside or against it. The fact that so many things were able
to change in the sexual behavior of Western societies without
any of the promises or political conditions predicted by
Reich being realized is sufficient proof that this whole sexual
"revolution," this whole "anti repressive" struggle, repre­
sented nothing more, but nothing less-and its importance
is undeniable-than a tactical shift and reversal in the great
deployment of sexuality. But it is also apparent why one
could not expect this critique to be the grid for a history of
that very deployment. Nor the basis for a movement to dis­
mantle it.

PART F I VE

R isht of Death
and Power over Life

For a long time, one of the characteristic privileges of
sovereign power was the right to decide life and death. In a
formal sense, it derived no doubt from the ancient patria
potestas that granted the father of the Roman family the
right to "dispose" of the life of his children and his slaves;
just as he had given them life, so he could take it away. By
the time the right of life and death was framed by the classi­
cal theoreticians, it was in a considerably diminished form.
It was no longer considered that this power of the sovereign
over his subjects could be exercised in an absolute and un­
conditional way, but only in cases where the sovereign's very
existence was in jeopardy: a sort of right of rejoinder. If he
were threatened by external enemies who s0ught to over­
throw him or contest his rights, he could then legitimately
wage war, and require his subjects to take part in the defense
of the state; without "directly proposing their death," he was
empowered to "expose their life": in this sense, he wielded
an "indirect" power over them of life and death. 1 But if
someone dared to rise up against him and transgress his laws,
then he could exercise a direct power over the offender's life:
as punishment, the latter would be put to death. Viewed in
this way, the power of life and death was not an absolute
privilege: it was conditioned by the defense of the sovereign,
and his own survival. Must we follow Hobbes in seeing it as
the transfer to the prince of the natural right possessed by
every individual to defend his life even if this meant the death
of others? Or should it be regarded as a specific right that was
manifested with the formation of that new juridical being,

the sovereign?2 In any case, in its modern form-relative and
limited-as in its ancient and absolute form, the right of life
and death is a dis symmetrical one. The sovereign exercised
his right of life only by exercising his right to kill, or by
refraining from killing; he evidenced his power over life only
through the death he was capable of requiring. The right
which was formulated as the "power of life and death" was
in reality the right to take life or let live. Its symbol, after
all, was the sword. Perhaps this juridical form must be re­
ferred to a historical type of society in which power was
exercised mainly as a means of deduction (prelevement), a
subtraction mechanism, a right to appropriate a portion of
the wealth, a tax of products, goods and services, labor and
blood, levied on the subjects. Power in this instance was
essentially a right of seizure: of things, time, bodies, and
ultimately life itself; it culminated in the privilege to seize
hold of life in order to suppress it.
Since the classical age the West has undergone a very
profound transformation of these mechanisms of power.
"Deduction" has tended to be no longer the major form of
power but merely one element among others, working to
incite, reinforce, control, monitor, optimize, and organize
the forces under it: a power bent on generating forces, mak­
ing them grow, and ordering them, rather than one dedicated
to impeding them, making them submit, or destroying them.
There has been a parallel shift in the right of death, or at least
a tendency to align itself with the exigencies of a life-adminis­
tering power and to define itself accordingly. This death that
was based on the right of the sovereign is now manifested as
simply the reverse of the right of the social body to ensure,
maintain, or develop its life. Yet wars were never as bloody
as they have been since the nineteenth century, and all things
"Just as a composite body can have propt'rties not found in any of the simple bodies
of which the mixture consists, so a moral body, by virtue of the very union of
persons of which it is composed, can have certain rights which none of the individu­
als could expressly claim and whose exercise is the proper function of leaders
alone." Pufendorf, Le Droit de la nature, p. 452.

Right of Death and Power over Life

1 37

being equal, never before did regimes visit such holocausts
on their own populations. But this formidable power of death
-and this is perhaps what accounts for part of its force and
the cynicism with which it has so greatly expanded its limits
-now presents itself as the counterpart of a power that
exerts a positive influence on life, that endeavors to adminis­
ter, optimize, and mUltiply it, subjecting it to precise controls
and comprehensive regulations. Wars are no longer waged in
the name of a sovereign who must be defended; they are
waged on behalf of the existence of everyone; entire popula­
tions are mobilized for the purpose of wholesale slaughter in
the name of life necessity: massacres have become vital. It is
as managers of life and survival, of bodies _and the race, that
so many regimes have been able to wage so many wars,
causing so many men to be killed. And through a turn that
closes the circle, as the technology of wars has caused them
to tend increasingly toward aU-out destruction, the decision
that initiates thetn and the one that terminates them are in
fact increasingly informed by the naked question of survival.
The atomic situation is now at the end point of this process:
the power to expose a whole population to death is the
underside of the power to guarantee an individual's con­
tinued existence. The principle underlying the tactics of bat­
tle-that one has to be capable of killing in order to go on
living-has become the principle that defines the strategy of
states. But the existence in question is no longer the juridical
existence of sovereignty; at stake is the biological existence
of a population. If genocide is indeed the dream of modern
powers, this is not because of a recent return of the ancient
right to kill; it is because power is situated and exercised at
the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale
phenomena of population.
On another level, I might have taken up the example of the
death penalty. Together with war, it was for a long time the
other form of the right of the sword; it constituted the reply
of the sovereign to those who attacked his will, his law, or

138

The History o f Sexuality

his person. Those who died on the scaffold became fewer and
fewer, in contrast to those who died in wars. But it was for
the same reasons that the latter became more numerous and
the former more and more rare. As soon as power gave itself
the function of administering life, its reason for being and the
logic of its exercise-and not the awakening of humanitarian
feelings-made it more and more difficult to apply the death
penalty. How could power exercise its highest prerogatives
by putting people to death, when its main role was to ensure,
sustain, and multiply life, to put this life in order? For such
a power, execution was at the same time a limit, a scandal,
and a contradiction. Hence capital punishment could not be
maintained except by invoking less the enormity of the crime
itself than the monstrosity of the criminal, his incorrigibility,
and the safeguard of society. One had the right to kill those
who represented a kind of biological danger to others.
One might say that the ancient right to take life or let live
was replaced by a power to foster life or disallow it to the
point of death. This is perhaps what explains that disqualifi­
cation of death which marks the recent wane of the rituals
that accompanied it. That death is so carefully evaded is
linked less to a new anxiety which makes death unbearable
for our societies than to the fact that the procedures of power
have not ceased to turn away from death. In the passage from
this world to the other, death was the manner in which a
terrestrial sovereignty was relieved by another, singularly
more powerful sovereignty; the pageantry that surrounded it
was in the category of political ceremony. Now it is over life,
throughout its unfolding, that power establishes its domin­
ion; death is power's limit, the moment that escapes it; death
becomes the most secret aspect of existence, the most "pri­
vate." It is not surprising that suicide-once a crime, since
it was a way to usurp the power of death which the sovereign
alone, whether the one here below or the Lord above, had the
right to exercise-became, in the course of the nineteenth
century, one of the first conducts to enter into the sphere of

Right of Death and Power over LIfe

sociological analysis; it testified to the individual and private
right to die, at the borders and in the interstices of power that
was exercised over life. This determination to die, strange
and yet so persistent and constant in its manifestations, and
consequently so difficult to explain as being due to particular
circumstances or individual accidents, was one of the first
astonishments of a society in which political power had as­
signed itself the task of administering life.
In concrete terms, starting in the seventeenth century, this
power over life evolved in two basic forms; these forms were
not antithetical, however; they constituted rather two poles
of development linked together by a whole intermediary
cluster of relations. One of these poles-the first to be
formed, it seems--centered on the body as a machine: its
disciplining, the optimization of its capabilities, the extortion
of its forces, the parallel increase of its usefulness and its
docility, its integration into systems of efficient and economic
controls, all this was ensured by the procedures of power that
characterized the disciplines: an anatomo-politics of the
human body. The second, formed somewhat later, focused
on the species body, the body imbued with the mechanics of
life and serving as the basis of the biological processes: propa­
gation, births and mortality, the level of health, life expect­
ancy and longevity, with all the conditions that can cause
these to vary. Their supervision was effected through an
entire series of interventions and regulatory controls: a bio­
politics of the population. The disciplines of the body and the
regulations of the population constituted the two poles
around which the organization of power over life was de­
ployed. The setting up, in the course of the classical age, of
this great bipolar technology-anatomic and biological, in­
dividualizing and specifying, directed toward the perfor­
mances of the body, with attention to the processes of life­
characterized a power whose highest function was perhaps
no longer to kill, but to invest life through and through.
The old power of death that symbolized sovereign power

140

The History of Sexuality

was now carefully supplanted by the administration of bodies
and the calculated management of life. During the classical
period, there was a rapid development o f various disciplines
-universities, secondary schools, barracks, workshops;
there was also the emergence, in the field of political prac­
tices and economic observation, of the problems of birthrate,
longevity, public health, housing, and migration. Hence
there was an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques
for achieving the SUbjugation of bodies and the control of
populations, marking the beginning of an era of "bio­
power. " The two directions taken by its development still
appeared to be clearly separate in the eighteenth century.
With regard to discipline, this development was embodied in
institutions such as the army and the schools, and in reflec­
tions on tactics, apprenticeship, education, and the nature of
societies, ranging from the strictly military analyses of Mar­
shal de Saxe to the political reveries of Guibert or Servan. As
for population controls, one notes the emergence of demog­
raphy, the evaluation of the relationship between resources
and inhabitants, the constructing of tables analyzing wealth
and its circulation: the work of Quesnay, Moheau, and Sliss­
milch. The philosophy of the "Ideologists," as a theory of
ideas, signs, and the individual genesis of sensations, but also
a theory of the social composition of interests-Ideology
being a doctrine of apprenticeship, but also a doctrine of
contracts and the regulated formation of the social body­
no doubt constituted the abstract discourse in which one
sought to coordinate these two techniques of power in order
to construct a general theory of it. In point of fact, however,
they were not to be joined at the level of a speCUlative
discourse, but in the form of concrete arrangements (agence­
ments concrets) that would go to make up the great technol­
ogy of power in the nineteenth century: the deployment of
sexuality would be one of them, and one of the most impor­
tant.
This bio-power was without question an indispensable ele-

Right of Death and Power over Life

141

ment i n the development of capitalism; the latter would not
have been p0ssible without the controlled insertion of bodies
into the machinery of production and the adjustment of the
phenomena of population to economic processes. But this
was not all it required; it also needed the growth of both these
factors, their reinforcement as well as their availability and
docility; it had to have methods of power capable of optimiz­
ing forces, aptitudes, and life in general without at the same
time making them more difficult to govern. If the develop­
ment of the great instruments of the state, as institutions of
power, ensured the maintenance of production relations, the
rudiments of anatomo- and bio-politics, created in the eigh­
teenth century as techniques of power present at every level
of the social body and utilized by very diverse institutions
(the family and the army, schools and the police, individual
medicine and the administration of collectiv� bodies), ope­
rated in the sphere of economic processes, their development,
and the forces working to sustain them. They also acted as
factors of segregation and social hierarchization, exerting
their influence on the respective forces of both these move­
ments, guaranteeing relations of domination and effects of
hegemony. The adjustment of the accumulation of men to
that of capital, the joining of the growth of human groups to
the expansion of productive forces and the differential alloca­
tion of profit, were made possible in part by the exercise of
bio-power in its many forms and modes of application. The
investment of the body, its valorization, and the distributive
management of its forces were at the time indispensable.
One knows how many times the question has been raised
concerning the role of an ascetic morality in the first forma"
tion of capitalism; but what occurred in the eighteenth cen­
tury in some Western countries, an event bound up with the
development of capitalism, was a different phenomenon hav­
ing perhaps a wider impact than the new morality; this was
nothing less than the entry of life into history, that is, the
entry of phenomena peculiar to the life of the human species

142

The History of Sexuality

into the order of knowledge and power, into the sphere of
political techniques. It is not a question of claiming that this
was the moment when the first contact between life and
history was brought about. On the contrary, the pressure
exerted by the biological on the historical had remained very
strong for thousands of years; epidemics and famine were the
two great dramatic forms of this relationship that was always
dominated by the menace of death. But through a circular
process, the economic-and primarily agricultural--devel­
opment of the eighteenth century, and an increase in produc­
tivity and resources even more rapid than the demographic
growth it encouraged, allowed a measure of relief from these
profound threats: despite some renewed outbreaks, the pe­
riod of great ravages from starvation and plague had come
to a close before the French Revolution; death was ceasing
to torment life so directly. But at the same time, the develop­
ment of the different fields of knowledge concerned with life
in general, the improvement of agricultural techniques, and
the observations and measures relative to man's life and
survival contributed to this relaxation: a relative control over
life averted some of the imminent risks of death. In the space
for movement thus conquered, and broadening and organiz­
ing that space, methods of power and knowledge assumed
responsibility for the life processes and undertook to control
and modify them. Western man was gradually learning what
it meant to be a living species in a living world, to have a
body, conditions of existence, probabilities of life, an individ­
ual and collective welfare, forces that could be modified, and
a space in which they could be distributed in an optimal
manner. For the first time in history, no doubt, biological
existence was reflected in political existence; the fact of living
was no longer an inaccessible substrate that only emerged
from time to time, amid the randomness of death and its
fatality; part of it passed into knowledge's field of control and
power's sphere of intervention. Power would no longer be
dealing simply with legal subjects over whom the ultimate

Right of Death and Power over Life

143

dominion was death, but with living beings, and the mastery
it would be able to exercise over them would have to be
applied at the level of life itself; it was the taking charge of
life, more than the threat of death, that gave power its access
even to the body. If one can apply the term bio-history to the
pressures through which the movements of life and the proc­
esses of history interfere with one another, one would have
to speak of bio-power to designate what brought life and its
mechanisms into the realm of explicit calculations and made
knowledge-power an agent of transformation of human life.
It is not that life has been totally integrated into techniques
that govern and administer it; it constantly escapes them.
Outside the Western world, famine exists, on a greater scale
than ever; and the biological risks confronting the species are
perhaps greater, and certainly more serious, than before the
birth of microbiology. But what might be called a society's
"threshold of modernity" has been reached when the life of
the species is wagered on its own political strategies. For
millennia, man remained what he was for Aristotle: a living
animal with the additional capacity for a political existence;
modern man is an animal whose politics places his existence
as a living being in question.
This transformation had considerable consequences. It
would serve no purpose here to dwell on the rupture that
occurred then in the pattern of scientific discourse and on the
manner in which the twofold problematic of life and man
disrupted and redistributed the order of the classical epis­
teme. If the question of man was raised-insofar as he was
a specific living being, and specifically related to other living
beings-the reason for this is to be sought in the new mode
of relation between history and life: in this dual position of
life that placed it at the same time outside history, in its
biological environment, and inside human historicity, pene­
trated by the latter's techniques of knowledge and power.
There is no need either to lay further stress on the prolifera­
tion of political technologies that ensued, investing the body,

144

The History of Sexuality

health, modes of subsistence and habitation, living condi­
tions, the whole space of existence.
Another consequence of this development of bio-power
was the growing importance assumed by the action of the
norm, at the expense of the juridical system of the law. Law
cannot help but but be armed, and its arm, par excellence,
is death; to those who transgress it, it replies, at least as a last
resort, with that absolute menace. The law always refers to
the sword. But a power whose task is to take charge of life
needs continuous regulatory and corrective mechanisms. It
is no longer a matter of bringing death into play in the field
of sovereignty, but of distributing the living in the domain of
value and utility. Such a power has to qualify, measure,
appraise, and hierarchize, rather than display itself in its
murderous splendor; it does not have to draw the line that
separates the enemies of the sovereign from his obedient
subjects; it effects distributions around the norm. I do not
mean to say that the law fades into the background or that
the institutions of justice tend to disappear, but rather that
the law operates more and more as a norm, and that the
judicial institution is increasingly incorporated into a con­
tinuum of apparatuses (medical, administrative, and so on)
whose functions are for the most part regulatory. A normal­
izing society is the historical outcome of a technology of
power centered on life. We have entered a phase of juridical
regression in comparison with the pre-seventeenth-century
societies we are acquainted with; we should not be deceived
by all the Constitutions framed throughout the world since
the French Revolution, the Codes written and revised, a
whole continual and clamorous legislative activity: these
were the forms that made an essentially normalizing power
acceptable.
Moreover, against this power that was still new in the
nineteenth century, the forces that resisted relied for support
on the very thing it invested, that is, on life and man as a
living being. Since the last century, the great struggles that

Right of Death and Power .over Life

1 45

have challenged the general system of power were not guided
by the belief in a return to former rights, or by the age-old
dream of a cycle of time or a Golden Age. One no longer
aspired toward the coming of the emperor of the poor, or the
kingdom of the latter days, or even the restoration of our
imagined ancestral rights; what was demanded and what
served as an objective was life, understood as the basic needs,
man's concrete essence, the realization of his potential, a
plenitude of the possible. Whether or not it was Utopia that
was wanted is of little importance; what we have seen has
been a very real process of struggle; life as a political object
was in a sense taken at face value and turned back against
the system that was bent on controlling it. It was life more
than the law that becam,e the issue of political struggles, even
if the latter were formulated through affirmations concerning
rights. The "right" to life, to one's body, to health, to happi­
ness, to the satisfaction of needs, and beyond all the oppres­
sions or "alienations," the "right" to rediscover what one is
and all that one can be, this "right" -which the classical
juridical system was utterly incapable of comprehending­
was the political response to all these new procedures of
power which did not derive, either, from the traditional right
of sovereignty.
This is the background that enables us to understand the
importance assumed by sex as a political issue. It was at the
pivot of the two axes along which developed the entire politi­
cal technology of life. On the one hand it was tied to the
disciplines of the body: the harnessing, intensification, and
distribution of forces, the adjustment and economy of ener­
gies. On the other hand, it was applied to the regulation of
populations, through all the far-reaching effects of its activ­
ity. It fitted in both categories at once, giving rise to infinitesi­
mal surveillances, permanent controls, extremely meticulous
orderings of space, indeterminate medical or psychological
examinations, to an entire micro-power concerned with the

1 46

The History of Sexuality

body. But it gave rise as well to comprehensive measures,
statistical assessments, and interventions aimed at the entire
social body or at groups taken as a whole. Sex was a means
of access both to the life of the body and the life of the
species. It was employed as a standard for the disciplines and
as a basis for regulations. This is why in the nineteenth
century sexuality was sought out in the smallest details of
individual existences; it was tracked down in behavior, pur­
sued in dreams; it was suspected of underlying the least
follies, it was traced back into the earliest years of childhood;
it became the stamp of individuality-at the same time what
enabled one to analyze the latter and what made it possible
to master it. But one also sees it becoming the theme of
political operations, economic interventions (through incite­
ments to or curbs on procreation), and ideological campaigns
for raising standards of morality and responsibility: it was
put forward as the index of a society's strength, revealing of
both its political energy and its biological vigor. Spread out
from one pole to the other of this technology of sex was a
whole series of different tactics that combined in varying
proportions the objective of disciplining the body and that of
regulating populations.
Whence the importance of the four great lines of attack
along which the politics of sex advanced for two centuries.
Each one was a way of combining disciplinary techniques
with regulative methods. The first two rested on the require­
ments of regulation, on a whole thematic of the species,
descent, and collective welfare, in order to obtain results at
the level of discipline; the sexualization of children was ac­
complished in the form of a campaign for the health of the
race (precocious sexuality was presented from the eighteenth
century to the end of the nineteenth as an epidemic menace
that risked compromising not only the future health of adults
but the future of the entire society and species); the hysteriza­
tion of women, which involved a thorough medicalization of
their bodies and their sex, was carried out in the name of the

Right of Death and Power over Life

147

responsibility they owed to the health of their children, the
solidity of the family institution, and the safeguarding of
society. It was the reverse relationship that applied in the
case of birth controls and the psychiatrization of perversions:
here the intervention was regulatory in nature, but it had to
rely on the demand for individual disciplines and constraints
(dressages). Broadly speaking, at the juncture of the "body"
and the "population," sex became a crucial target of a power
organized around the management of life rather than the
menace of death.
The blood relation long remained an important element in
the mechanisms of power, its manifestations, and its rituals.
For a society in which the systems of alliance, the political
form of the sovereign, the differentiation into orders and
castes, and the value of descent lines were predominant; for
a society in which famine, epidemics, and violence made
death imminent, blood constituted one of the fundamental
values. It owed its high value at the same time to its instru­
mental role (the ability to shed blood), to the way it func­
tioned in the order of signs (to have a certain blood, to be of
the same blood, to be prepared to risk one's blood), and also
to its precariousness (easily spilled, subject to drying up, too
readily mixed, capable of being quickly corrupted). A society
of blood-I was tempted to say, of "sanguinity"-where
power spoke through blood: the honor of war, the fear of
famine, the triumph of death, the sovereign with his sword,
executioners, and tortures; blood was a reality with a sym­
bolic function. We, on the other hand, are in a society of
"sex," or rather a society "with a sexuality": the mechanisms
of power are addressed to the body, to life, to what causes
it to proliferate, to what reinforces the species, its stamina,
its ability to dominate, or its capacity for being used.
Through the themes of health, progeny, race, the future of
the species, the vitality of the social body, power spoke of
sexuality and to sexuality; the latter was not a mark or a
symbol, it was an object and a target. Moreover, its impor-

148

The History of Sexuality

tance was due less to its rarity or its precariousness than to
its insistence, its insidious presence, the fact that it was every­
where an object of excitement and fear at the same time.
Power delineated it, aroused it, and employed it as the prolif­
erating meaning that had always to be taken control of again
lest it escape; it was an effect with a meaning-value. I do not
mean to say that a substitution of sex for blood was by itself
responsible for all the transformations that marked the
threshold of our modernity. It is not the soul of two civiliza­
tions or the organizing principle of two cultural forms that
I am attempting to express; I am looking for the reasons for
which sexuality, far from being repressed in the society of
that period, on the contrary was constantly aroused. The
new procedures of power that were devised during the classi­
cal age and employed in the nineteenth century were what
caused our societies to go from a symbolics of blood to an
analytics ofsexuality. Clearly, nothing was more on the side
of the law, death, transgression, the symbolic, and sove­
reignty than blood; just as sexuality was on the side of the
norm, knowledge, life, meaning, the disciplines, and regula­
tions.
Sade and the first eugenists were contemporary with this
transition from "sanguinity" to "sexuality." But whereas the
first dreams ofthe perfecting of the species inclined the whole
problem toward an extremely exacting administration of sex
(the art of determining good marriages, of inducing the
desired fertilities, of ensuring the health and longevity of
children), and while the new concept of race tended to oblit­
erate the aristocratic particularities of blood, retaining only
the controllable effects of sex, Sade carried the exhaustive
analysis of sex over into the mechanisms of the old power of
sovereignty and endowed it with the ancient but fully main­
tained prestige of blood; the latter flowed through the whole
dimension of pleasure-the blood of torture and absolute
power, the blood of the caste which was respected in itself
and which nonetheless was made to flow in the major rituals

Right 0/ Death and Power over Life

149

of parricide and incest, the blood of the people, which was
shed unreservedly since the sort that flowed in its veins was
not even deserving of a name. In Sade, sex is without any
norm or intrinsic rule that might be formulated from its own
nature; but it is subject to the unrestricted law of a power
which itself knows no other law but its own; if by chance it
is at times forced to accept the order of progressions carefully
disciplined into successive days, this exercise carries it to a
point where it is no longer anything but a unique and naked
sovereignty: an unlimited right of all-powerful monstrosity.
While it is true that the analytics of sexuality and the
symbolics of blood were grounded at first in two very distinct
regimes of power, in actual fact the passage from one to the
other did not come about (any more than did these powers
themselves) without overlappings, interactions, and echoes.
In different ways, the preoccupation with blood and the law
has for nearly two centuries haunted the administration of
sexuality. Two of these interferences are noteworthy, the one
for its historical importance, the other for the problems it
poses. Beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century,
the thematics of blood was sometimes called on to lend its
entire historical weight toward revitalizing the type of politi­
cal power that was exercised through the devices of sexuality.
Racism took shape at this point (racism in its modern, "bi­
ologizing," statist form): it was then that a whole politics of
settlement (peuplement), family, marriage, education, social
hierarchization, and property, accompanied by a long series
of permanent interventions at the level of the body, conduct,
health, and everyday life, received their color and their jus­
tification from the mythical concern with protecting the
purity of the blood and ensuring the triumph of the race.
Nazism was doubtless the most cunning and the most naive
(and the former because of the latter) combination of the
fantasies of blood and the paroxysms of a disciplinary power.
A eugenic ordering of society, with all that implied in the
way of extension and intensification of micro-powers, in the

1 50

The History of Sexuality

guise of an unrestricted state control (etatisation), was ac­
companied by the oneiric exaltation of a superior blood; the
latter implied both the systematic genocide of others and the
risk of exposing oneself to a total sacrifice. It is an irony of
history that the Hitlerite politics of sex remained an insignifi­
cant practice while the blood myth was transformed into the
greatest blood bath in recent memory.
At the opposite extreme, starting from this same end of the
nineteenth century, we can trace the theoretical effort to
reinscribe the thematic of sexuality in the system of law, the
symbolic order, and sovereignty. It is to the political credit
of psychoanalysis-or at least, of what was most coherent in
it-that it regarded with suspicion (and this from its incep­
tion, that is, from the moment it broke away from the neu­
ropsychiatry of degenerescence) the irrevocably proliferating
aspects which might be contained in these power mech­
anisms aimed at controlling and administering the everyday
life of sexuality: whence the Freudian end�avor (out of reac­
tion no doubt to the great surge of racism that was contem­
porary with it) to ground sexuality in the law-the law of
alliance, tabooed consanguinity, and the Sovereign-Father,
in short, to surround desire with all the trappings of the old
order of power. It was owing to this that psychoanalysis was
-in the main, with a few exceptions-in theoretical and
practical opposition to fascism. But this position of psychoa­
nalysis was tied to a specific historical conjuncture. And yet,
to conceive the category of the sexual in terms of the law,
death, blood, and sovereignty-whatever the references
to Sade and Bataille, and however one _might gauge their
"subversive" influence-is in the last analysis a historical
"retro-version." We must conceptualize the deployment of
sexuality on the basis of the techniques of power that are
contemporary with it.
People are going to say that I am dealing in a historicism
which is more careless than radical; that I am evading the

Right of Death and Power over Life

151

biologically established existence of sexual functions for the
benefit of phenomena that are variable, perhaps, but fragile,
secondary, and ultimately superficial; and that I speak of
sexuality as if sex did not exist. And one would be entitled
to object as follows: "You claim to analyze in detail the
processes by which women's bodies, the lives of children,
family relationships, and an entire network of social relations
were sexualized. You wish to describe that great awakening
of sexual concern since the eighteenth century and our grow­
ing eagerness to suspect the presence of sex in everything. Let
us admit as much and suppose that the mechanisms of power
were in fact used more to arouse and 'excite' sexuality than
to repress it. But here you remain quite near to the thing you
no doubt believe you have gotten away from; at bottom,
when you point out phenomena of diffusion, anchorage, and
fixation of sexuality, you are trying to reveal what might be
called the organization of 'erotic zones' in the social body; it
may well be the case that you have done nothing more than
transpose to the level of diffuse processes mechanisms which
psychoanalysis has identified with precision at the level ofthe
individual. But you pass over the thing on the basis of which
this sexualization was able to develop and which psychoanal­
ysis does not fail to recognize-namely, sex. Before Freud,
one sought to localize sexuality as closely as possible: in sex,
in its reproductive functions, in its immediate anatomical
localizations; one fell back upon a biological minimum:
organ, instinct, and finality. You, on the other hand, are in
a symmetrical and inverse position: for you, there remain
only groundless effects, ramifications without roots, a sexual­
ity without a sex. What is this if not castration once again?"
Here we need to distinguish between two questions. First,
does the analysis of sexuality necessarily imply the elision of
the body, anatomy, the biological, the functional? To this
question, I think we can reply in the negative. In any case,
the purpose of the present study is in fact to show how
deployments of power are directly connected to the body-

1 52

The History of Sexuality

to bodies, functions, physiological processes, sensations, and
pleasures; far from the body having to be effaced, what is
needed is to make it visible through an analysis in which the
biological and the historical are not consecutive to one an­
other, as in the evolutionism of the first sociologists, but are
bound together in an increasingly complex fashion in accord­
ance with the development of the modern technologies of
power that take life as their objective. Hence I do not envis­
age a "history of mentalities" that would take account of
bodies only through the manner in which they have been
perceived and given meaning and value; but a "history of
bodies" and the manner in which what is most material and
most vital in them has been invested.
Another question, distinct from the first one: this material­
ity that is referred to, is it not, then, that of sex, and is it not
paradoxical to venture a history of sexuality at the level of
bodies, without there being the least question of sex? After
all, is the power that is exercised through sexuality not di­
rected specifically at that element of reality which is "sex,"
sex in general? That sexuality is not, in relation to power, an
exterior domain to which power is applied, that on the con­
trary it is a result and an instrument of power's designs, is
all very well. But as for sex, is it not the "other" with respect
to power, while being the center around which sexuality
distributes its effects? Now, it is precisely this idea of sex in
itself that we cannot accept without examination. Is "sex"
really the anchorage point that supports the manifestations
of sexuality, or is it not rather a complex idea that was
formed inside the deployment of sexuality? In any case, one
could show how this idea of sex took form in the different
strategies of power and the definite role it played therein.
All along the great lines which the development of the
deployment of sexuality has followed since the nineteenth
century, one sees the elaboration of this idea that there exists
something other than bodies, organs, somatic localizations,
functions, anatomo-physiological systems, sensations, and

Right of Death and Power over Life

153

pleasures; something else and something more, with intrinsic
properties and laws of its own: "sex." Thus, in the process
of hysterization of women, "sex" was defined in three ways:
as that which belongs in common to men and women; as that
which belongs, par excellence, to men, and hence is lacking
in women; but at the same time, as that which by itself
constitutes woman's body, ordering it wholly in terms of the
functions of reproduction and keeping it in constant agita­
tion through the effects of that very function. Hysteria was
interpreted in this strategy as the movement of sex insofar as
it was the "one" and the "other," whole and part, principle
and lack. In the sexualization of childhood, there was formed
the idea of a sex that was both present (from the evidence of
anatomy) and absent (from the standpoint of physiology),
present too if one considered its activity, and deficient if one
referred to its reproductive finality; or again, actual in its
manifestations, but hidden in its eventual effects, whose path­
ological seriousness would only become apparent later. If the
sex of the child was still present in the adult, it was in the
form of a secret causality that tended to nullify the sex of the
latter (it was one of the tenets of eighteenth- and nineteenth­
century medicine that precocious sex would eventually result
in sterility, impotence, frigidity, the inability to experience
pleasure, or the deadening of the senses); by sexualizing
childhood, the idea was established of a sex characterized
essentially by the interplay of presence and absence, the visi­
ble and the hidden; masturbation and the effects imputed to
it were thought to reveal in a privileged way this interplay
of presence and absence, of the visible and the hidden.
In the psychiatrization of perversions, sex was related to
biological functions and to an anatomo-physiological ma­
chinery that gave it its "meaning," that is, its finality; but it
was also referred to an instinct which, through its peculiar
development and according to the objects to which it could
become attached, made it possible for perverse behavior pat­
terns to arise and made their genesis intelligible. Thus "sex"

1 54

The History of Sexuality

was defined by the interlacing of function and instinct, final­
ity and signification; moreover, this was the form in which
it was manifested, more clearly than anywhere else, in the
model perversion, in that "fetishism" which, from at least as
early as 1 877, served as the guiding thread for analyzing all
the other deviations. In it one could clearly perceive the way
in which the instinct became fastened to an object in accord­
ance with an individual's historical adherence and biological
inadequacy. Lastly, in the socialization of procreative behav­
ior, "sex" was described as being caught between a law of
reality (economic necessity being its most abrupt and imme­
diate form) and an economy of pleasure which was always
attempting to circumvent that law-when, that is, it did not
ignore it altogether. The most notorious of "frauds," coitus
interruptus, represented the point where the insistence of the
real forced an end to pleasure and where the pleasure found
a way to surface despite the economy dictated by the real. It
is apparent that the deployment of sexuality, with its differ­
ent strategies, was what established this notion of "sex"; and
in the four major forms of hysteria, onanism, fetishism, and
interrupted coition, it showed this sex to be governed by the
interplay of whole and part, principle and lack, absence and
presence, excess and deficiency, by the function of instinct,
finality, and meaning, of reality and pleasure.
The theory thus generated performed a certain number of
functions that made it indispensable. First, the notion of
"sex" made it possible to group together, in an artificial
unity, anatomical elements, biological functions, conducts,
sensations, and pleasures, and it enabled one to make use of
this fictitious unity as a causal principle, an omnipresent
meaning, a secret to be discovered everywhere: sex was thus
able to function as a unique signifier and as a universal
signified. Further, by presenting itself in a unitary fashion, as
anatomy and lack, as function and latency, as instinct and
meaning, it was able to mark the line of contact between a
knowledge of human sexuality and the biological sciences of

Right of Death and Power over Life

155

reproduction; thus, without really borrowing anything from
the these sciences, excepting a few doubtful analogies, the
knowledge of sexuality gained through proximity a guaran­
tee·of quasi-scientificity; but by virtue of this same proximity,
some of the contents of biology and physiology were able to
serve as a principle of normality for human sexuality. Fi­
nally, the notion of sex brought about a fundamental rever­
sal; it made it possible to invert the representation of the
relationships of power to sexuality, causing the latter to ap­
pear, not in its essential and positive relation to power, but
as being rooted in a specific and irreducible urgency which
power tries as best it can to dominate; thus the idea of "sex"
makes it possible to evade what gives "power" its power; it
enables one to conceive power solely as law and taboo. Sex
-that agency which appears to dominate us and that secret
which seems to underlie all that we are, that point which
enthralls us through the the power it manifests and the
meaning it conceals, and which we ask to reveal what we are
and to free us from what defines us-is doubtless but an ideal
point made necessary by the deployment of sexuality and its
operation. We must not make the mistake of thinking that
sex is an autonomous agency which secondarily produces
manifold effects of sexuality over the entire length of its
surface of contact with power. On the contrary, sex is the
most speculative, most ideal, and most internal element in a
deployment of sexuality organized by power in its grip on
bodies and their materiality, their forces, energies, sensa­
tions, and pleasures.
It might be added that "sex" performs yet another func­
tion that runs through and sustains the ones we have just
examined. Its role in this instance is more practical than
theoretical. It is through sex-in fact, an imaginary point
determined by the deployment of sexuality-that each
individual has to pass in order to have access to his own
intelligibility (seeing that it is both the hidden aspect and the
generative principle of meaning), to the whole of his body

156

The History of Sexuality

(since it is a real and threatened part of it, while symbolically
constituting the whole), to his identity (since it joins the force
of a drive to the singularity of a history). Through a reversal
that doubtless had its surreptitious beginnings long ago-it
'was already making itself felt at the time of the Christian
pastoral of the flesh-we have arrived at the point where we
expect our intelligibility to come from what was for many
centuries thought of as madness; the plenitude of our body
from what was long considered its stigma and likened to a
wound; our identity from what was perceived as an obscure
and nameless urge. Hence the importance we ascribe to it,
the reverential fear with which we surround it, the care we
take to know it. Hence the fact that over the centuries it has
become more important than our soul, more important al­
most than our life; and so it is that all the world's enigmas
appear frivolous to us compared to this secret, minuscule in
each of us, but of a density that makes it more serious than
any other. The Faustian pact, whose temptation has been
instilled in us by the deployment of sexuality, is now as
follows: to exchange life in its entirety for sex itself, for the
truth and the sovereignty of sex. Sex is worth dying for. It
is in this (strictly historical) sense that sex is indeed imbued
with the death instinct. When a long while ago the West
discovered love, it bestowed on it a value high enough to
make death acceptable; nowadays it is sex that claims this
equivalence, the highest of all. And while the deployment of
sexuality permits the techniques of power to invest life, the
fictitious point of sex, itself marked by that deployment,
exerts enough charm on everyone for them to accept hearing
the grumble of death within it.
By creating the imaginary element that is "sex," the de­
ployment of sexuality established one of its most essential
internal operating principles: the desire for sex-the desire to
have it, to have access to it, to discover it, to liberate it, to
articulate it in discourse, to formulate it in truth. It con­
stituted "sex" itself as something desirable. And it is this

Right of Death and Power over Life

1 57

desirability of sex that attaches each one of us to the injunc­
tion to know it, to reveal its law and its power; it is this
desirability that makes us think we are affirming the rights
of our sex against all power, when in fact we are fastened to
the deployment of sexuality that has lifted up from deep
within us a sort of mirage in which we think we see ourselves
reflected-the dark shimmer of sex.
"It is sex," said Kate in The Plumed Serpent. "How won­
derful sex can be, when men keep it powerful and sacred, and
it fills the world! like sunshine through and through one!"
So we must not refer a history of sexuality to the agency
of sex; but rather show how "sex" is historically subordinate
to sexuality. We must not place sex on the side of reality, and
sexuality on that of confused ideas and illusions; sexuality is
a very real historical formation; it is what gave rise to the
notion of sex, as a speculative element necessary to its opera­
tion. We must not think that by saying yes to sex, one says
no to power; on the contrary, one tracks along the course laid
out by the general deployment of sexuality. It is the agency
of sex that we must break away from, if we aim-through a
tactical reversal of the various mechanisms of sexuality-to
counter the grips of power with the claims of bodies, pleas­
ures, and knowledges, in their mUltiplicity and their possibil­
ity of resistance. The rallying point for the counterattack
against the deployment of sexuality ought not to be sex­
desire, but bodies and pleasures.
"There has been so much action in the past," said D. H.
Lawrence, "especially sexual action, a wearying repetition
over and over, without a corresponding thought, a corre­
sponding realization. Now our business is to realize sex.
Today the full conscious realization of sex is even more
important than the act itself."
Perhaps one day people will wonder at this. They will not
be able to understand how a civilization so intent on develop­
ing enormous instruments of production and destruction

158

The History of Sexuality

found the time and the infinite patience to inquire so anxi­
ously concerning the actual state of sex; people will smile
perhaps when they recall that here were men-meaning our­
selves-who believed that therein resided a truth every bit as
precious as the one they had already demanded from the
earth, the stars, and the pure forms of their thought; people
will be surprised at the eagerness with which we went about
pretending to rouse from its slumber a sexuality which every­
thing-our discourses, our customs, our institutions, our
regulations, our knowledges-was busy producing in the
light of day and broadcasting to noisy accompaniment. And
people will ask themselves why we were so bent on ending
the rule of silence regarding what was the noisiest of our
preoccupations. In retrospect, this noise may appear to have
been out of place, but how much stranger will seem our
persistence in interpreting it as but the refusal to speak and
the order t� remain silent. People will wonder what could
have made us so presumptuous; they will look for the reasons
that might explain why we prided ourselves on being the first
to grant sex the importance we say is its due and how we
came to congratulate ourselves for finally-in the twentieth
century-having broken free of a long period of harsh repres­
sion, a protracted Christian asceticism, greedily and fastidi­
ously adapted to the imperatives of bourgeois economy. And
what we now perceive as the chronicle of a censorship and
the difficult struggle to remove it will be seen rather as the
centuries-long rise of a complex deployment for compelling
sex to speak, for fastening our attention and concern upon
sex, for getting us to believe in the sovereignty of its law when
in fact we were moved by the power mechanisms of sexuality.
People will be amused at the reproach of pansexualism
that was once aimed at Freud and psychoanalysis. But the
ones who will appear to have been blind will perhaps be not
so much those who formulated the objection as those who
discounted it out of hand, as if it merely expressed the fears
of an outmoded prudishness. For the first, after all, were only

Right of Death and Power over Life

1 59

taken unawares by a process which had begun long before
and by which, unbeknown to them, they were already sur­
rounded on all sides; what they had attributed solely to the
genius of Freud had already gone through a long stage of
preparation; they had gotten their dates wrong as to the
establishment, in our society, of a general deployment of
sexuality. But the others were mistaken concerning the na­
ture of the process; they believed that Freud had at last,
through a sudden reversal, restored to sex the rightful share
which it had been denied for so long; they had not seen how
the good genius of Freud had placed it at one of the critical
points marked out for it since the eighteenth century by the
strategies of knowledge and power, how wonderfully effec­
tive he was-worthy of the greatest spiritual fathers and
directors of the classical period-in giving a new impetus to
the secular injunction to study sex and transform it into
discourse. We are often reminded of the countless procedures
which Christianity once employed to make us detest the
body; but let us ponder all the ruses that were employed for
centuries to make us love sex, to make the knowledge of it
desirable and everything said about it precious. Let us con­
sider the stratagems by which we were induced to apply all
our skills to discovering its secrets, by which we were at­
tached to the obligation to draw out its truth, and made
guilty for having failed to recognize it for so long. These
devices are what ought to make us wonder today. Moreover,
we need to consider the possibility that one day, perhaps, in
a different economy of bodies and pleasures, people will no
longer quite understand how the ruses of sexuality, and the
power that sustains its organization, were able to subject us
to that austere monarchy of sex, so that we became dedicated
to the endless task of forcing its secret, of exacting the truest
of confessions from a shadow.
The irony of this deployment is in having us believe that
our "liberation" is in the balance.
